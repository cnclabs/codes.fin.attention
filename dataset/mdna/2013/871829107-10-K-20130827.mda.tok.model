item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our discussion below of our results includes certain non gaap financial measures that we believe provide important perspective with respect to underlying business trends 
any non gaap financial measure will be denoted as an adjusted measure and our fiscal comparisons to fiscal exclude the impact from business transformation project costs  multiemployer pension plan charges  severance charges  executive retirement plans restructuring  a one time acquisition related charge and facility closure charges 
collectively  these are referred to as excluded charges 
our fiscal comparisons to fiscal exclude the impact from business transformation project costs  multiemployer pension plan charges  severance charges  corporate owned life insurance coli policies and certain tax benefits 
more information on the rationale for the use of these measures and reconciliations to gaap numbers can be found under non gaap reconciliations 
overview sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants  healthcare and educational facilities  lodging establishments and other foodservice customers 
our operations are primarily located throughout the united states  bahamas  canada  ireland and northern ireland and include broadline companies which include our custom cut meat operations  sygma our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary  specialty produce companies  hotel supply operations  a company that distributes specialty imported products and a company that distributes to international customers 
we consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the united states and canada and estimate that we serve about of this approximately billion annual market 
according to industry sources  the foodservice  or food away from home  market represents approximately of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the united states 
industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the united states experienced a real sales increase of approximately in calendar year and a decline of in calendar year real sales changes do not include the impact of inflation or deflation 
general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food away from home and  in turn  can impact our customers and our sales 
we believe the current general economic conditions  including pressure on consumer disposable income  have contributed to a decline in the foodservice market 
historically  we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and believe we have continued to grow our market share in this fragmented industry 
highlights fiscal was a year in which we progressed with our business transformation project while facing a challenging business and economic environment 
the foodservice industry has not fully participated in the overall economic recovery primarily due to constrained consumer spending for food away from home 
our results of operations reflect these challenges as well as expenses related to our business transformation project  payroll costs  charges from the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans and increased fuel expense 
we believe our sales growth and expense management on a cost per cases basis was acceptable  however gross profit did not grow as we planned due partially to competitive pressures and a shift in customer mix 
we will remain focused on the execution of our business plan and initiatives from our business transformation project  with the goal for these items to contribute to the long term success of our customers and in turn  growth in our earnings 
we acquired companies during fiscal  which represents annualized sales in excess of billion 
we expect these acquisitions will contribute to our sales growth  enhance our international market presence and product assortment 
comparison of results from fiscal to fiscal sales increased  or billion to billion 
operating income decreased  or million  to billion 
adjusted operating income decreased  or million  to billion 
net earnings decreased  or million  to billion 
adjusted net earnings increased  or million  to billion 
basic earnings per share in fiscal was  a decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of per share 
diluted earnings per share in fiscal was  a decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of per share 
adjusted diluted earnings per share was in fiscal  a decrease from the comparable prior year amount of per share 
see non gaap reconciliations for an explanation of these non gaap financial measures 
trends and strategy trends general economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food away from home and  in turn  can impact our customers and our sales 
consumer confidence has improved since  however it remains below its historical highs 
we believe that the consumer is currently concerned about lingering unemployment levels and lack of growth in personal income 
we believe these items and other current general economic conditions  have negatively impacted consumer confidence and contributed to a slow rate of recovery in the foodservice market 
while these trends can be cyclical in nature  greater consumer confidence will be required to reverse the trend 
according to industry sources  real sales growth for the total foodservice market in the united states is expected to be modest over the long term 
non traditional competitors are becoming more of a factor in terms of competition within our industry  and consumer spending trends are gradually shifting more to fresh  natural and sustainably produced products 
we believe these industry trends reinforce the need for us to transform our business so that we can be in a position to provide greater value to our customers and reduce our overall cost structure 
our gross margin performance has been influenced by multiple factors 
our sales growth in fiscal was greater with our large regional and national customers 
gross margin from these types of customers is generally lower than our independent restaurant customers 
if sales from our independent restaurant customers do not grow at the same rate or a greater rate than sales from these large regional and national customers  our gross margins may decline 
additional pressure exists on our gross margin from competitive pricing pressures 
low growth in the foodservice market is contributing to increased competition which is in turn pressuring gross profits 
we expect this pricing pressure will likely continue 
inflation can be a factor that contributes to gross margin pressure  however  inflation rates remained relatively stable throughout fiscal at a rate between to 
inflation was present in certain product categories such as poultry and meat  but was not significant in the majority of our product categories 
while we cannot predict whether inflation will continue at current levels  periods of high inflation  either overall or in certain product categories  can have a negative impact on us and our customers  as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food away from home market  and may negatively impact our sales  gross profit  operating income and earnings 
we have experienced higher operating expenses this fiscal year as compared to fiscal our business transformation project has been a primary contributor to this increase 
this project is a key part of our strategy to control costs and grow our market share over the long term 
this project includes an integrated software system that went into deployment in august  resulting in increased deployment expenses and software amortization 
in fiscal  we were still building and testing our software and therefore had a greater amount of capitalized costs 
we believe expenses related to the project in fiscal will be similar to the costs incurred in fiscal operating expenses have also increased due to provisions related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals 
these pension plan provisions generally occur when a collective bargaining agreement is being renewed 
pay related expenses have increased primarily from acquired companies and within delivery areas of our business  however these have been partially offset by lower costs in the selling and information technology areas due to initiatives from our business transformation project 
fuel costs have increased due to both increases diesel prices and gallon usage 
our retirement related expenses consist primarily of costs from our company sponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan  our supplement executive retirement plan serp and our defined contribution plan 
the net impact in fiscal of our retirement related expenses as compared to fiscal was an increase of million 
at the end of fiscal  we decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the retirement plan as of december  for all united states based us based salaried and non union hourly employees 
effective january   these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced  defined contribution plan 
absent the retirement plan freeze discussed above  net company sponsored pension costs would have increased million in fiscal  however because of the freeze the costs decreased as compared to fiscal our expenses related to our defined contribution plan increased in fiscal during fiscal  we approved a plan to restructure our executive nonqualified retirement program  including the serp  by freezing benefits 
we believe this restructuring more closely aligns our executive plans with our non executive plans 
as a result of this restructuring  we incurred million in charges in fiscal we expect our retirement related expenses will decrease in the range of million to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal a greater portion of the decrease will occur in the second half of fiscal due to operation of our enhanced  defined contribution plan for a one year period 
excluding the million restructuring charge in fiscal  the decrease is expected to be million to million in fiscal over the long term  we believe the changes to all of these retirement programs will result in reduced volatility of retirement related expenses and a reduction in total retirement related expenses 
we expect gross margin pressure to persist in fiscal  however  we intend to achieve sales case growth and to reduce costs per case to improve our earnings performance trends in fiscal as compared to fiscal strategy we are focused on optimizing our core broadline business in the united states  canada and ireland  while continuing to explore appropriate opportunities to profitably grow our market share and create shareholder value by expanding beyond our core business 
day to day  our business decisions are driven by our mission to market and deliver great products to our customers with exceptional service  with the aspirational vision of becoming each of our customers most valued and trusted business partner 
we have identified five strategies to help us achieve our mission and vision profoundly enrich the experience of doing business with sysco our primary focus is to help our customers succeed 
we believe that by building on our current competitive advantages  we will be able to further differentiate our offering to customers 
our competitive advantages include our sales force of over  marketing associates  our diversified product base  which includes quality assured sysco brand products  the suite of services we provide to our customers such as business reviews and menu analysis  and our wide geographic presence in the united states and canada 
in addition  we have a portfolio of businesses spanning broadline  specialty meat  chain restaurant distribution  specialty produce  hotel amenities  specialty import and export which serves our customers needs across a wide array of business segments 
through our sysco ventures platform  we are developing a suite of technology solutions that help support the administrative needs of our customers 
we believe this strategy of enriching the experience of doing business with sysco will increase customer retention and profitably accelerate sales growth with both existing and new customers 
continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business our multi year business transformation project is designed to improve productivity and reduce costs 
an integrated software system is included in this project and will support a majority of our business processes to further streamline our operations and reduce costs 
these systems are commonly referred to as enterprise resource planning erp systems 
we view the technology as an important enabler of this project  however the larger outcome of this project will be from transformed processes that standardize portions of our operations 
this includes a shared business service center to centrally manage certain back office functions that are currently performed at a majority of our operating companies 
this project includes other components to lower our cost structure through improved productivity without impacting our service to our customers 
we continue to optimize warehouse and delivery activities across the corporation to achieve a more efficient delivery of products to our customers and we seek to improve sales productivity and lower general and administrative costs 
we also have a product cost reduction and category management initiative to use market data and customer insights to make changes to product pricing and product assortment 
expand our portfolio of products and services by initiating a customer centric innovation program we continually explore opportunities to provide new and improved products  technologies and services to our customers 
explore  assess and pursue new businesses and markets this strategy is focused on identifying opportunities to expand the core business through growth in new international markets and in adjacent areas that complement our core foodservice distribution business 
as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis  we regularly evaluate business opportunities  including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses 
develop and effectively integrate a comprehensive  enterprise wide talent management process our ability to drive results and grow our business is directly linked to having the best talent in the industry 
we are committed to the continued enhancement of our talent management programs in terms of how we recruit  select  train and develop our associates throughout sysco as well as succession planning 
our ultimate objective is to provide our associates with outstanding opportunities for professional growth and career development 
business transformation project our multi year business transformation project consists of the design and deployment of an erp system to implement an integrated software system to support a majority of our business processes and further streamline our operations  a cost transformation initiative to lower our cost structure  a product cost reduction and category management initiative to use market data and customer insights to make changes to product pricing and product assortment  and several other initiatives 
we deployed our erp system to three additional locations in fiscal and experienced improved functionality in many areas compared to past deployments 
our shared services center  sysco business services  continues to expand and provide a broader array of centralized administrative services 
the majority of the system functionality is performing as designed  however  we have identified areas for improvement to certain components of the system that we want to address before we continue deploying to additional locations 
these improvements include simplifying certain processes to improve response times and reduce system loads 
we believe that this will improve system stability and result in improved ability to scale the system as we move forward 
while these improvements are being made  we will continue implementing individual modules such as our human resource module and continue with other business transformation initiatives 
we intend to deploy the system to one additional location around the end of this calendar year 
if our updates are successful  we anticipate that further deployment will resume early in calendar our deployment schedule will be further defined at that time 
our cost transformation initiative seeks to lower our cost structure by million to million annually by fiscal these include initiatives to increase our productivity in the warehouse and delivery activities including fleet management and maintenance activities 
it also involves improving sales productivity and reducing general and administrative expenses  partially through aligning compensation and benefit plans 
efforts from our cost transformation initiatives in fiscal spanned many areas of operations 
we completed the implementation of maintenance management tools in our united states broadline us broadline companies 
a customer relationship management tool has been implemented in our us broadline companies that will improve sales productivity 
we restructured our information technology department and contracted with a third party provider for information technology managed services 
for our us broadline companies  we accelerated the implementation of our human resource module from our erp system which is expected to be complete by the third quarter of fiscal also  in our us broadline companies we began centralizing field finance work to our shared services center 
we believe this transition will be complete by december we have begun implementing enhancements to our routing technology and processes to improve delivery efficiencies and expect this initiative to be complete by fiscal lastly  our retirement programs have been restructured  which we believe will result in reduced volatility of retirement related expenses and a reduction in total retirement related expenses in the long term 
our product cost reduction and category management initiative is designed to lower our total product costs by million to million annually by fiscal and to align our product assortment with current customer demand 
we are using market data and customer insights to make changes to our product assortment while building strategic partnerships with our suppliers 
we believe there are opportunities to more effectively provide the products that our customers want  commit to greater volumes with our suppliers and create mutual benefits for all parties 
we believe that procuring greater quantities with select vendors will result in reduced prices for our product purchases 
in fiscal  our product cost reduction and category management initiative was active in reducing skus in our inventory and increasing participation in our centralized purchasing initiative 
we are in the process of piloting four product categories in our category management initiative and have received encouraging acceptance rates from our customers of our new assortment of products 
our suppliers have engaged in the process and appreciate building strategic partnerships that include customer insights into current trends and product innovations 
expenses related to the business transformation project were million in fiscal or per share  million in fiscal or per share and million in fiscal or per share 
the increase in costs in was largely attributable to deployment costs and software amortization  which began in august software amortization totaled million in the increase in costs in was due to increased project spending  reduced capitalization of expenditures and expenses due to the ramp up of our shared services center 
we anticipate that project expenses for fiscal will be similar to fiscal despite the increase in expense  our cash outlay for our business transformation project  which excludes non cash software amortization  decreased approximately million as compared to fiscal our goal for our business transformation project is to generate approximately million to million in annual benefits to be achieved by fiscal in fiscal  we believe we exceeded our goal of realizing approximately of the total benefit 
in fiscal  we believe we can obtain approximately to of the total targeted benefit 
if we are successful in obtaining these benefits in fiscal  some of the trends in gross profits and operating expenses noted above could be favorably impacted 
our original goal was to grow our diluted earnings per share to to by fiscal despite the success of our business transformation project  our diluted earnings per share has not grown as originally anticipated due to the difficult economic environment and the general operating performance of our underlying business that did not meet our expectations 
we no longer believe we will achieve our original goal of producing diluted earnings per share to to by fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating income interest expense other expense income  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings the following table sets forth the change in the components of our consolidated results of operations expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating income interest expense other expense income  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share average shares outstanding diluted shares outstanding other expense income  net was income of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal sales sales for fiscal were higher than fiscal sales for fiscal increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices  sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last months and case volume growth 
our sales growth in fiscal was greater with our large regional and national customers as compared to sales growth with our independent restaurant customers 
we believe our independent sales growth has been negatively influenced by lower consumer sentiment 
case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last months improved in fiscal our case volumes represent our results from our broadline and sygma segments only 
sales from acquisitions within the last months favorably impacted sales by for fiscal our acquisition activity has been greater in fiscal as compared to fiscal we estimate the carryover impact into fiscal will cause sales to increase by approximately 
we expect to continue the trend of closing acquisitions in fiscal that will continue to add at least in total annualized sales from new acquisitions in fiscal changes in product costs  an internal measure of inflation or deflation  were estimated as inflation of during fiscal case volumes including acquisitions within the last months improved approximately in fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact on sales when compared to fiscal sales for fiscal were higher than fiscal sales for fiscal increased as a result of product cost inflation  and the resulting increase in selling prices  along with improving case volumes 
changes in product cost  an internal measure of inflation  were approximately during fiscal case volumes including acquisitions within the last months improved approximately during fiscal case volumes excluding acquisitions within the last months improved approximately during fiscal sales from acquisitions in the last months favorably impacted sales by for fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact on sales when compared to fiscal operating income cost of sales primarily includes our product costs  net of vendor consideration  and includes in bound freight 
operating expenses include the costs of facilities  product handling  delivery  selling and general and administrative activities 
fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross profit  fuel costs are reflected within operating expenses 
fiscal vs 
fiscal the following table sets forth the change in the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year change in dollars change in thousands gross profit operating expenses operating income gross profit adjusted operating expenses non gaap adjusted operating income non gaap the decrease in operating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily driven by increased expenses  including charges related to our business transformation project and increased pay related expenses 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased sales 
gross margin  which is gross profit as a percentage of sales  was in fiscal  a decline of basis points from the gross margin of in fiscal this decline in gross margin was partially the result of increased growth from large regional and national customers 
gross margin from these types of customers is generally lower than other types of customers 
as seen in our results during fiscal  if sales from our independent restaurant customers do not grow at the same rate sales from these large regional and national customers  our gross margins may decline 
increased competition resulting from a slow growth market also contributed to the decline in gross margins 
we estimate that sysco s product cost inflation was during fiscal based on our product sales mix for fiscal  we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the poultry and meat product categories 
while we cannot predict whether inflation will occur  prolonged periods of high inflation  either overall or in certain product categories  can have a negative impact on us and our customers  as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food away from home market  and may negatively impact our sales  gross profit and earnings 
operating expenses for fiscal increased  or million  over fiscal  primarily due to increased expenses from our business transformation project  pay related expenses  charges related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals  depreciation and amortization expense and fuel 
adjusted operating expenses increased  or million  in fiscal over fiscal the increase in adjusted operating expenses was primarily due to increased pay related expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and fuel 
expenses related to our business transformation project  inclusive of pay related and software amortization expense  were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of million 
the increase in fiscal resulted in part from the initiation of software amortization as the system was placed into service in august the increase in depreciation and amortization expense related to the business transformation project was million in fiscal over fiscal our project was not in the deployment stage during any period of fiscal  therefore  a greater portion of the costs were capitalized in fiscal we anticipate that project expenses for fiscal will be similar to fiscal pay related expenses  excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project and retirement related expenses  increased by million in fiscal over fiscal the increase was primarily due to added costs from companies acquired in the last months and increased delivery and warehouse compensation 
delivery and warehouse compensation includes activity based pay which will increase when our case volumes increase 
additionally  pay rates have been higher particularly in geographies where oil and gas exploration occurs due to labor shortages 
these increases were partially offset by reduced sales and information technology pay related expenses as a result of some of our business transformation initiatives 
during fiscal  we streamlined our sales management organization and modified marketing associate compensation plans 
we also restructured our information technology department during the mid point of fiscal  reducing headcount as a result 
our retirement related expenses consist primarily of costs from our retirement plan  serp and our defined contribution plan 
the net impact in fiscal of our retirement related expenses as compared to fiscal was an increase of million  consisting of million increased costs from the defined contribution plan  a million decrease in our net company sponsored pension costs and approximately million for other costs 
at the end of fiscal  sysco decided to freeze future benefit accruals under the retirement plan as of december  for all us based salaried and non union hourly employees 
effective january   these employees were eligible for additional contributions under an enhanced  defined contribution plan 
absent the retirement plan freeze  net company sponsored pension costs would have increased million in fiscal during fiscal  we approved a plan to restructure our executive nonqualified retirement program including the serp and our executive deferred compensation plan 
a non qualified defined contribution plan became effective on january  as a replacement plan and benefits were frozen under the serp at the end of fiscal we believe this restructuring more closely aligned our executive plans with our non executive plans 
as a result of this restructuring  we incurred million in charges in fiscal we expect our retirement related expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal will decrease in the range of million to million primarily from reduced expenses of our retirement plan  partially offset by increased defined contribution plan expenses 
a greater portion of the decrease will occur in the second half of fiscal due to operation of our enhanced  defined contribution plan for a one year period 
excluding the million restructuring charge in fiscal and the decrease in fiscal is expected to be million to million 
over the long term  we believe the changes to all of these retirement programs will result in reduced volatility of retirement related expenses and a reduction in total retirement related expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in fiscal over fiscal the increase related to our business transformation project is described above 
the remaining increase of million in fiscal was primarily related to assets that were not placed in service in fiscal that were in service in fiscal  primarily from new facilities  property from new acquisitions and expansions 
from time to time  we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans 
in fiscal and fiscal  we recorded provisions of million and million  respectively  related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals 
fuel costs increased by million in fiscal over fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased contracted diesel prices and increased gallon usage 
our costs per gallon increased in fiscal over fiscal our activities to mitigate fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques  improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges 
we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements with a goal of mitigating a portion of the volatility in fuel prices 
our fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 
as of june   we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately million through august these contracts will lock in the price of approximately to of our fuel purchase needs for the remainder of the fiscal year at prices slightly lower than the current market price for diesel 
assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal  fuel costs  exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are expected to increase by approximately to million as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon current  published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense  including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 
we also measure our expense performance on a cost per case basis 
this metric is calculated by taking the total operating expense of our broadline companies  excluding charges multiemployer pension plans and severance charges  divided by the number of cases sold 
we seek to grow our sales and either minimize or reduce our costs on a per case basis 
our fiscal cost per case decreased by more than per case as compared to fiscal primarily from reduced pay related expenses from our sales and information technology areas  partially offset by increased costs from delivery and warehouse pay related expenses  increased retirement related expenses and fuel increases 
we expect to continue to reduce our broadline companies cost per case in fiscal by approximately per case partially from reduced retirement related expenses 
fiscal vs 
fiscal the following table sets forth the change in the components of operating income and adjusted operating income expressed as a percentage increase or decrease over the prior year change in dollars change in thousands gross profit operating expenses operating income gross profit adjusted operating expenses non gaap adjusted operating income non gaap the decrease in operating income from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by declines in gross margin and increased operating expenses partially from increased expenses from payroll and our business transformation project 
these expense increases were partially offset by increases in gross profit dollars 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased sales 
gross margin  which is gross profit as a percentage of sales  was in fiscal  a decline of basis points from the gross margin of in fiscal this decline in gross margin was primarily the result of product cost inflation 
other factors contributing to our gross margin decline were competitive pressures on pricing  segment mix changes where certain of our lower margin segments grew faster than our broadline segment and our own strategy to gain market share 
sysco s product cost inflation was estimated as inflation of during fiscal based on our product sales mix for fiscal  we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the meat  canned and dry and frozen product categories in the range of to 
our product cost inflation reached a high of in the first quarter of fiscal and a low of in the fourth quarter of fiscal while we are generally able to pass through modest levels of inflation to our customers  we were unable to fully pass through these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross margin in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers business and therefore our business 
gross profit dollars for fiscal also increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were approximately million higher in fiscal than in fiscal due to higher fuel prices incurred during fiscal and the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base for the entire fiscal period 
operating expenses for fiscal increased primarily due to increased pay related expenses  increased expenses related to our business transformation project  increased fuel costs and an unfavorable year over year comparison on the amounts recorded to adjust the carrying value of coli policies to their cash surrender values as compared to the prior year period 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in net company sponsored pension costs and lower provisions related to multiemployer pension plans 
adjusted operating expenses increased  or million  in fiscal over fiscal pay related expenses  excluding labor costs associated with our business transformation project  increased by million in fiscal over fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased sales and delivery compensation and added costs from companies acquired within the last months 
sales compensation includes commissions which are driven by gross profit dollars and case volumes  and delivery compensation includes activity based pay which is driven by case volumes 
since these drivers were variable in nature  increased gross profit dollars and cases volumes increased sales and delivery compensation 
also contributing to the increase in pay related expenses was an increase in severance incurred in fiscal over fiscal of million 
expenses related to our business transformation project  inclusive of pay related expense  were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of million 
the increase in fiscal resulted from increased project spending  reduced capitalization of expenditures and expenses due to the ramp up of our shared services center 
fuel costs increased by million in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to increased contracted and market diesel prices 
our costs per gallon increased in fiscal over fiscal our fuel commitments will result in either additional fuel costs or avoided fuel costs based on the comparison of the prices on the fixed price contracts and market prices for the respective periods 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 
in fiscal  the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated million of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes 
we adjust the carrying values of our coli policies to their cash surrender values on an ongoing basis 
the cash surrender values of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying investments  which through fiscal included publicly traded securities 
as a result  the cash surrender values of these policies fluctuated with changes in the market value of such securities 
the changes in the financial markets resulted in gains for these policies of million in fiscal near the end of fiscal  we reallocated all of our policies into low risk  fixed income securities to reduce earnings volatility and therefore our adjustments for fiscal were not significant 
net company sponsored pension costs in fiscal were million lower than in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to higher returns on assets of sysco s retirement plan obtained in fiscal from time to time  we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans 
in the last two fiscal years  we voluntary withdrew from several multiemployer plans and recorded provisions of million in fiscal and million in fiscal our fiscal  our broadline companies cost per case increased approximately per case as compared to fiscal primarily from increased pay related expenses and higher fuel costs 
net earnings net earnings decreased in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to the changes in operating income discussed above 
adjusted net earnings increased in fiscal the increase in adjusted net earnings in fiscal was primarily from increased gross profits  partially offset by increases in adjusted operating expenses that were primarily due to increased pay related expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and fuel 
net earnings for fiscal decreased over fiscal this decrease was primarily due to changes in operating income discussed above 
adjusted net earnings increased during fiscal the effective tax rate of for fiscal was favorably impacted primarily by two items 
first  we recorded a tax benefit of million related to changes in estimates for the prior year domestic tax provision 
second  we recorded a tax benefit of million related to disqualifying dispositions of sysco stock pursuant to share based compensation arrangements 
the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the recording of million in tax and interest related to various federal  foreign and state uncertain tax positions 
indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory rates less than our domestic tax rate also had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
indefinitely reinvested earnings taxed at foreign statutory tax rates less than our domestic tax rate had the impact of reducing the effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate of for fiscal was favorably impacted primarily by two items 
first  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million for the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on state net operating loss carryforwards 
second  we adjust the carrying values of our coli policies to their cash surrender values 
the gain of million recorded in fiscal was primarily non taxable for income tax purposes  and had the impact of decreasing income tax expense for the period by million 
partially offsetting these favorable impacts was the recording of million in tax and interest related to various federal  foreign and state uncertain tax positions 
earnings per share basic earnings per share in fiscal was  a decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of per share 
diluted earnings per share in fiscal was  a decrease from the comparable prior year period amount of per share 
this decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above 
adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal was  a decrease of from the comparable prior year period amount of 
all earnings per share metrics for the fiscal were partially impacted from greater shares outstanding 
sysco experienced a greater number of stock option exercises in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which has increased the number of shares outstanding 
basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal were and  respectively 
this represents a decrease from the comparable prior year period amount for basic earnings per share of per share and a decrease from the comparable prior year period amount for diluted earnings per share of 
this decrease was primarily the result of the factors discussed above 
adjusted diluted earnings per share was in fiscal and in fiscal  or an increase of 
non gaap reconciliations sysco s results of operations are impacted by costs from the business transformation project btp costs  multiemployer pension plans mepp  severance  executive retirement plans restructuring  a one time acquisition related charge and facility closure charges 
management believes that adjusting its operating expenses  operating income  net earnings and diluted earnings per share to remove the impact of these items provides an important perspective with respect to underlying business trends and results and provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is indicative of the performance of the company s underlying operations and facilitates comparison on a year over year basis 
additionally  near the end of fiscal  we reallocated all of our investments in our coli policies into low risk  fixed income securities and therefore we do not expect significant volatility in operating expenses  operating income  net earnings and diluted earnings per share in future periods related to these policies 
we experienced significant gains in these policies during fiscal in addition  we recorded tax benefits in fiscal as such  the comparison of fiscal and fiscal is also adjusted for coli gains and recognized tax benefits

segment results we have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments  of which only broadline and sygma are reportable segments as defined in accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise 
the accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by sysco within the financial statements and supplementary data within part ii item of this form k 
intersegment sales represent specialty produce and imported specialty products distributed by the broadline and sygma operating companies 
management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results 
corporate expenses generally include all expenses of the corporate office and sysco s shared service center 
these also include all share based compensation costs and expenses related to the company s business transformation project 
while a segment s operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in gross profits  expenses  or a combination thereof  over the long term each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth 
this is consistent with our long term goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth 
the following table sets forth the operating income of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage of each segment s sales for each period reported and should be read in conjunction with note  business segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item operating income as a percentage of sales broadline sygma other the following table sets forth the change in the selected financial data of each of our reportable segments and the other segment expressed as a percentage increase over the prior year and should be read in conjunction with note  business segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item operating operating sales income sales income broadline sygma other sygma had operating income of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the following table sets forth sales and operating income of each of our reportable segments  the other segment  and intersegment sales  expressed as a percentage of aggregate segment sales  including intersegment sales  and operating income  respectively 
for purposes of this statistical table  operating income of our segments excludes corporate expenses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal that are not charged to our segments 
this information should be read in conjunction with note  business segment information to the consolidated financial statements in item segment segment segment operating operating operating sales income sales income sales income broadline sygma other intersegment sales total broadline segment the broadline reportable segment is an aggregation of the company s united states  canadian  caribbean and european broadline segments 
broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non food products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers  hospitals  schools  hotels  industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served 
these companies also provide custom cut meat operations 
broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of sysco s operations 
in fiscal  the broadline operating results represented approximately of sysco s overall sales and of the aggregate operating income of sysco s segments  which excludes corporate expenses 
there are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the sygma and other operating segments 
we have invested substantial amounts in assets  operating methods  technology and management expertise in this segment 
the breadth of its sales force  geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to benefit from this segment s earnings 
sales sales were greater in fiscal than fiscal sales for fiscal increased as a result of product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices  sales from acquisitions that occurred within the last months and improving case volumes 
our sales growth in fiscal has been greater with our large regional and national customers as compared to sales growth with our independent restaurant customers 
we believe our independent sales growth has been negatively influenced by lower consumer sentiment 
sales from acquisitions within the last months contributed to the overall sales comparison for fiscal our acquisition activity has been greater in fiscal as compared to fiscal we estimate the carryover impact into fiscal will cause sales to increase by approximately 
we expect to continue at the trend of closing acquisitions in fiscal that will continue to add annualized sales from new acquisitions in fiscal changes in product costs  an internal measure of inflation or deflation  were estimated as inflation of in fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact on sales when compared to fiscal sales for fiscal were greater than fiscal product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices  combined with case volume improvement  contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal changes in product costs  an internal measure of inflation or deflation  were estimated as inflation of in fiscal non comparable acquisitions contributed to the overall sales comparison for fiscal the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars negatively impacted sales by compared to fiscal operating income operating income decreased by in fiscal from fiscal this decrease was driven by operating expenses increasing more than gross profit dollars 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal primarily due to increased sales  however  gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales 
this decline in gross margin was partially the result of increased growth from large regional and national customers 
gross margin from these types of customers is generally lower than from other types of customers 
as seen in our results during fiscal  if sales from our independent restaurant customers do not grow at the same rate as sales from these large regional and national customers  our gross margins may decline 
increased competition resulting from a slow growth market also contributed to the decline in gross margins 
our broadline segment experienced product cost inflation in fiscal based on our product sales mix during fiscal  we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the poultry and meat product categories 
while we cannot predict whether inflation will occur  prolonged periods of high inflation  either overall or in certain product categories  can have a negative impact on us and our customers  as high food costs can reduce consumer spending in the food away from home market  and may negatively impact our sales  gross profit and earnings 
operating expenses for the broadline segment increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the expense increases in fiscal were driven largely by charges related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals  pay related expenses including severance costs  depreciation and amortization expense and fuel 
the increase in pay related expenses was primarily due to increased delivery and warehouse compensation  partially attributable to case growth  and added costs from companies acquired in the last months 
delivery and warehouse compensation includes activity based pay which will increase when our case volumes increase 
additionally  pay rates have been higher particularly in geographies where oil and gas exploration occurs 
these increases were partially offset by reduced sales and information technology pay related expenses 
our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective january  and contributed to the increase in operating expenses 
depreciation and amortization increased primarily from assets that were not placed in service in fiscal that were in service in fiscal  primarily from new facilities  property from new acquisitions and expansions 
fuel costs were million higher in fiscal than in fiscal assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal  fuel costs exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are expected to increase by approximately million to million as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon current  published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
we continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense  including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management 
from time to time  we may voluntarily withdraw from multiemployer pension plans to minimize or limit our future exposure to these plans 
in fiscal and fiscal  we recorded provisions of million and million  respectively  related to multiemployer pension plan withdrawals 
our fiscal cost per case decreased by more than per case as compared to fiscal primarily from reduced pay related expenses from our sales and information technology areas  partially offset by increased costs from delivery and warehouse pay related expenses  increased retirement related expenses and fuel increases 
we expect to continue to reduce our cost per case in fiscal by approximately per case partially from reduced retirement related expenses 
operating income increased by in fiscal over fiscal this increase was driven by gross profit dollars increasing more than operating expenses 
gross profit dollars increased in fiscal primarily due to increased sales  however  gross profit dollars increased at a lower rate than sales 
this decline in gross margin was primarily the result of product cost inflation and competitive pressures on pricing 
based on broadline s product sales mix for fiscal  we were most impacted by higher levels of inflation in the meat  canned and dry and frozen product categories 
while we are generally able to pass through modest levels of inflation to our customers  we were unable pass through fully these higher levels of product cost inflation with the same gross margin in these product categories without negatively impacting our customers business and therefore our business 
in addition  gross profit dollars for fiscal increased as a result of higher fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges were approximately million higher in fiscal than the prior year due to the application of fuel surcharges to a broader customer base during fiscal due to higher fuel prices incurred during these periods 
operating expenses for the broadline segment increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal the expense increases in fiscal were driven largely by an increase in pay related expenses and fuel costs  partially offset by a favorable comparison in the provisions recorded for the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans in each fiscal year 
sales compensation includes commissions which are driven by gross profit dollars and case volumes  and delivery compensation includes activity based pay which is driven by case volumes 
since these drivers are variable in nature  increased gross profit dollars and case volumes will increase sales and delivery compensation 
fuel costs were million higher in fiscal than the prior year 
we recorded provisions related to the withdrawal from multiemployer pension plans of million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  our broadline companies cost per case increased approximately per case as compared to fiscal primarily from increased pay related expenses and higher fuel costs 
sygma segment sygma operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations 
sygma operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco s other segments 
this segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins 
these operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis 
sales sales were greater in fiscal than in fiscal the increase was primarily due to product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices  partially offset by case volume declines 
case volumes were challenged from low levels of growth from existing customers and from lost customers 
while sygma has experienced some success in replacing lost business with new customers  it has not been enough to significantly overcome the factors noted above 
we believe sygma s sales growth prospects are better in fiscal as compared to fiscal sales were greater in fiscal than in fiscal the increase in sales was primarily due to product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices 
sales to new customers also contributed to the increase 
one chain restaurant customer the wendy s company accounted for approximately of the sygma segment sales for the fiscal year ended june  sygma maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer 
while the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sygma  we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole 
operating income operating income decreased by in fiscal from fiscal gross profit dollars decreased while operating expenses increased in fiscal over fiscal these gross profit results largely reflect the sluggish sales environment 
operating expenses increased in fiscal largely due to increased delivery costs including pay related expenses 
our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective january  and contributed to the increase in pay related expense 
operating income decreased million in from the prior year due to rising operating expenses 
gross profit dollars increased while operating expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal contributing to the gross profit increase in fiscal were increased sales and an increase of approximately million in the fuel surcharges charged to customers in fiscal from prior year due to higher fuel prices in fiscal the increase in operating expenses for fiscal was largely driven by increased fuel costs 
fuel costs in fiscal were million greater than the prior year 
assuming that fuel prices do not significantly rise above recent levels during fiscal  we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our sygma segment not to fluctuate significantly as compared to fiscal other segment other financial information is attributable to our other operating segments  including our specialty produce and lodging industry products segments  a company that distributes specialty imported products and a company that distributes to international customers 
these operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature 
on an aggregate basis  our other segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than sysco s broadline segment 
sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years 
these operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry except for our lodging industry supply company 
each individual operation is also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average broadline operation and each of these operating segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the broadline segment 
in fiscal  in the aggregate  the other segment represented approximately of sysco s overall sales and of the aggregate operating income of sysco s segments  which excludes corporate expenses 
operating income increased for fiscal over fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily driven by earnings from our lodging industry products segment  our specialty import business  that was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  and our company that distributes to international customers 
all businesses in this segment experienced increased operating income which was partially offset by charges in our specialty produce companies which incurred facility closing costs of million in fiscal an additional item partially offsetting the increase in operating income was an increase in retirement related expense for these companies 
our enhanced defined contribution plan became effective january  and contributed to increased expense at these companies 
operating income decreased for fiscal from fiscal the decrease in operating income was caused partially due to increased expenses in our specialty produce segment 
liquidity and capital resources highlights comparisons of the cash flows from fiscal to fiscal cash flows from operations were billion this year compared to billion last year 
settlement payments to the internal revenue service irs were zero this year compared to million last year 
capital expenditures totaled million this year compared to million last year 
free cash flow was billion this year compared to million last year see non gaap reconciliation below under the heading free cash flow 
cash flows for acquisition of businesses were million this year compared to million last year 
net bank borrowings were a net borrowing of million this year compared to a net repayment of million last year 
proceeds from exercises of share based compensation awards was million this year compared to million last year 
treasury stock purchases were million this year compared to million last year 
dividends paid were million this year compared to million last year 
sources and uses of cash sysco s strategic objectives include continuous investment in our business  these investments are funded by a combination of cash from operations and access to capital from financial markets 
our operations historically have produced significant cash flow 
cash generated from operations is generally allocated to working capital requirements  investments in facilities  systems  fleet  other equipment and technology  return of capital to shareholders  including cash dividends and share repurchases  acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy  contributions to our various retirement plans  and debt repayments 
any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in high quality  short term instruments 
as a part of our ongoing strategic analysis  we regularly evaluate business opportunities  including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses  and our overall capital structure 
any transactions resulting from these evaluations may materially impact our liquidity  borrowing capacity  leverage ratios and capital availability 
we continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations and remain in a strong financial position  however our liquidity and capital resources can be influenced by economic trends and conditions that impact our results of operations 
uncertain economic conditions and uneven levels of consumer confidence and the resulting pressure on consumer disposable income have lowered our sales growth and impacted our cash flows from operations 
competitive pressures in a low growth environment have also lowered our gross margins which in turn can cause our cash flows from operations to decrease 
we believe our mechanisms to manage working capital  such as credit monitoring  optimizing inventory levels and maximizing payment terms with vendors  and our mechanisms to manage the items impacting our gross profits have been sufficient to limit a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations 
we believe these mechanisms will continue prevent a significant unfavorable impact on our cash flows from operations 
as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  approximately of which was held by our international subsidiaries generated from our earnings of international operations 
if these earnings were transferred among countries or repatriated to the united states  such amounts may be subject to additional tax obligations  however  we do not currently anticipate the need to relocate this cash 
we believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months  while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes our cash flows from operations  the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs  supported by our revolving credit facility  and bank lines of credit  our ability to access capital from financial markets  including issuances of debt securities  either privately or under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec 
due to our strong financial position  we believe that we will continue to be able to effectively access the commercial paper market and long term capital markets  if necessary 
we believe our cash flows from operations will improve over the long term due to benefits from our business transformation project and initiatives to improve our working capital management 
cash flows operating activities fiscal vs 
fiscal we generated billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal  as compared to billion in fiscal the increase of million or  was largely attributable to a favorable comparison year over year on the settlement payments made to the irs  an increase in non cash depreciation and amortization expense and a favorable comparison for multiemployer and company sponsored pension expense and contributions 
these decreases were partially offset by a reduction in net earnings  the redemption of some of our coli policies in fiscal and a reduction in taxes 
changes in working capital  including accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  did not have a significant impact on the comparison of cash flow from operations from fiscal to fiscal these items are more fully described below 
in fiscal  we paid million in settlement payments to the irs 
we completed these settlement payments in fiscal  which resulted in a favorable comparison in cash flow from operations related to this item in fiscal excluding the irs settlement payment comparison  the combined impact of changes in deferred taxes and changes in accrued income taxes was a decrease of in cash flow from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from decreased tax expense of million year over year and an increase in non irs tax payments of million which were primarily foreign tax payments related to a one time transaction as well as increased earnings in these jurisdictions 
the increase in non cash depreciation and amortization expense of million was primarily related to assets that were not in service in fiscal that were in service in fiscal these assets include our software related to our business transformation project  which was placed into service in august  as well as various new facilities and expansions 
we do not anticipate that our depreciation and amortization expense will increase as much in fiscal multiemployer and company sponsored pension expense and contributions resulted in a favorable comparison of million in cash flow from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal provisions for multiemployer pension withdrawals increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and payments for withdrawals decreased million 
company sponsored pension contributions decreased million year over year  which was partially offset by a decrease in company sponsored pension expense of million 
we anticipate making a million payment in the first weeks of fiscal related to a fiscal multiemployer pension withdrawal 
the comparison of cash flow from operations from fiscal to fiscal was negatively impacted by an unfavorable change of million in other assets 
this unfavorable change resulted primarily from an increase in cash in the prior year from the redemption of approximately million of our coli policies 
these coli policies were maintained to meet a portion of our obligations under the serp and were replaced by less volatile corporate owned real estate assets as part of our plan to reduce the market driven coli impact on our earnings 
there was no similar redemption in fiscal other miscellaneous changes in other assets partially offset this decrease year over year 
fiscal vs 
fiscal we generated billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal  as compared to billion in fiscal the increase of million between fiscal and fiscal was largely attributable to changes in working capital  a year over year reduction in tax payments and the redemption of some of our coli policies 
these increases were partially offset by the year over year impact of multiemployer withdrawal provisions and payments 
these items are more fully described below 
changes in working capital  specifically accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  contributed million to the increase in cash flow from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal both periods were affected by increases in accounts receivable and inventory  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable resulting primarily from inflation driven increases in product costs and sales 
however  fiscal was impacted by these items to a lesser extent due primarily to working capital improvements within accounts receivable and inventory and also less growth in average daily sales in the final month of fiscal as compared to the same period in fiscal tax payments were million less in fiscal than in fiscal the decrease in tax payments was partially due to the company being in a prepaid position at the end of fiscal in certain jurisdictions 
in addition  various movements in taxable temporary differences caused estimated taxable income to be lower in fiscal  requiring less tax payments in fiscal than in fiscal we made our final payments on a previous irs tax settlement of million in fiscal we received approximately million in cash from the one time redemption during the period of some of our investments in coli policies that we maintained to meet a portion of our obligations under the serp 
this resulted in a positive impact to cash flow from operations in fiscal by decreasing other assets by million 
those redeemed coli policies were replaced by less volatile existing corporate owned real estate assets as part of our plan to reduce the market driven coli impact on our earnings 
multiemployer withdrawal provisions and payments had a negative impact of million on the comparison of cash flow from operations in fiscal to fiscal the net impact of withdrawal provisions and payments was a cash outflow of million in fiscal  compared to a million accrual in fiscal investing activities fiscal capital expenditures included fleet replacements  construction of a fold out facility in southern california  replacement or significant expansion of facilities in atlanta  georgia  british columbia  canada  boston  massachusetts and columbia  south carolina  and investments in technology 
fiscal capital expenditures included replacement or significant expansion of facilities in san diego  california  boston  massachusetts  lincoln  nebraska  syracuse  new york and central texas  construction of fold out facilities in southern california and long island  new york  the continued remodeling of our shared services facility purchased in fiscal  fleet replacements  and investments in technology including our business transformation project 
fiscal capital expenditures included investments in technology including our business transformation project  fleet replacements  replacement or significant expansion of facilities in philadelphia  pennsylvania and central texas  the purchase of land for a fold out facility in southern california  and the remodeling of our shared services facility purchased in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal decreased by million from fiscal primarily due to less investment in technology in fiscal related to our business transformation project due to the initiation of the project s deployment phase in august capital expenditures in fiscal increased by million over fiscal primarily due to a greater number of new facilities and expansion projects underway in fiscal as compared to fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal  and for our business transformation project were million  million and million  respectively 
we expect total capital expenditures in fiscal to be in the range of million to million 
fiscal expenditures will include facility  fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions  new facility construction  including fold out facilities  and investments in technology 
during fiscal  in the aggregate  the company paid cash of million for operations acquired during fiscal and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years 
during fiscal  we acquired for cash foodservice operations in nassau  bahamas  san francisco  california  san jose  california  stockton  california  ontario  canada  quebec  canada  orlando  florida  dublin  ireland  st 
cloud  minnesota  co 
down  northern ireland  greenville  ohio and houston  texas 
during fiscal  in the aggregate  the company paid cash of million for operations acquired during fiscal and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years 
during fiscal  we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in sacramento  california  quebec  canada  new haven  connecticut  grand rapids  michigan  minneapolis  minnesota  columbia  south carolina and spokane  washington 
in addition  sysco acquired for cash a company that distributes specialty imported products headquartered in chicago  illinois 
during fiscal  in the aggregate  the company paid cash of million for operations acquired during fiscal and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years 
during fiscal  we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in central california  los angeles  california  ontario  canada  lincoln  nebraska  and trenton  new jersey 
free cash flow free cash flow represents net cash provided from operating activities less purchases of plant and equipment plus proceeds from sales of plant and equipment 
sysco considers free cash flow to be a non gaap liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of buildings  fleet  equipment and technology  which may potentially be used to pay for  among other things  strategic uses of cash including dividend payments  share repurchases and acquisitions 
we do not mean to imply that free cash flow is necessarily available for discretionary expenditures  however  as it may be necessary that we use it to make mandatory debt service or other payments 
as a result of reduced capital spending and increased cash provided by operating activities  free cash flow for fiscal increased  or million  to billion as compared to fiscal increased cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by increased capital spending  resulted in free cash flow for fiscal increasing  or million  to million as compared to fiscal we expect the growth rate in free cash flow for fiscal will not be as significant as the growth rate experienced in fiscal free cash flow should not be used as a substitute in assessing the company s liquidity for the periods presented 
an analysis of any non gaap financial measure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
in the tables that follow  free cash flow for each period presented is reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities 
change in dollars change in thousands net cash provided by operating activities gaap additions to plant and equipment proceeds from sales of plant and equipment free cash flow non gaap change in dollars change in thousands net cash provided by operating activities gaap additions to plant and equipment proceeds from sales of plant and equipment free cash flow non gaap financing activities equity transactions proceeds from exercises of share based compensation awards were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the higher level of proceeds in fiscal and fiscal was due to an increase in the number of options exercised in these years  as compared to fiscal the level of option exercises  and thus proceeds  will vary from period to period and is largely dependent on movements in our stock price 
we traditionally have engaged in board approved share repurchase programs 
the number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were  shares for million in fiscal   shares for million in fiscal and  shares for million in fiscal there were  additional shares repurchased through august   resulting in a remaining authorization by our board of directors to repurchase up to  shares  based on the trades made through that date 
our share repurchase strategy is to purchase enough shares to keep our average shares outstanding relatively constant over time 
due to a high level of stock option exercises in fiscal  more shares were repurchased to meet this strategy 
the number of shares we repurchase in fiscal will be dependent on the level of stock option exercises  however  we believe that share repurchases will be significantly less than the amount repurchased in fiscal because fewer options are now available for exercise than in fiscal we have made dividend payments to our shareholders in each fiscal year since our company inception over years ago 
we target a dividend payout of to of net earnings 
we paid in excess of that range in fiscal and fiscal primarily due to increased expenses from our business transformation project 
we believe as we realize benefits from this project  our dividend payout will return to this targeted range 
dividends paid were million  or per share  in fiscal  million  or per share  in fiscal and million  or per share  in fiscal in may  we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal of per share  which was paid in july in november  we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement covering  shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions 
as of august    shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement 
debt activity and borrowing availability short term borrowings we have uncommitted bank lines of credit  which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to million  of which none was outstanding as of june  outstanding borrowings under this facility were million as of august  in september  the company s irish subsidiary  pallas foods  entered into a million euro multicurrency revolving credit facility  which will be utilized for capital needs for the company s european subsidiaries 
this facility replaces the subsidiary s previous million euro committed facility for unsecured borrowings 
the new facility provides for unsecured borrowings and expires september   but is subject to extension 
outstanding borrowings under this facility were million euro as of june   located within notes payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
outstanding borrowings under this facility were million euro as of august  on june   a canadian subsidiary of sysco entered into a short term demand loan facility for the purpose of facilitating a distribution from the canadian subsidiary to sysco  and sysco concurrently entered into an agreement with the bank to guarantee the loan 
the amount borrowed was million and was repaid in full on july  commercial paper and revolving credit facility we have a board approved commercial paper program allowing us to issue short term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed billion 
in december  we terminated our previously existing revolving credit facility that supported the company s us and canadian commercial paper programs 
at the same time  sysco and one of its subsidiaries  sysco international  ulc  entered into a new billion credit facility supporting the company s us and canadian commercial paper programs 
this facility provides for borrowings in both us and canadian dollars 
borrowings by sysco international  ulc under the credit agreement are guaranteed by sysco  and borrowings by sysco and sysco international  ulc under the credit agreement are guaranteed by all the wholly owned subsidiaries of sysco that are guarantors of the company s senior notes and debentures 
the original facility in the amount of billion expires on december  in december  a portion of the facility was extended for an additional year 
this extended facility  which expires on december   is for million of the original billion facility  but is subject to further extension 
as of june   commercial paper issuances outstanding were million 
as of august   commercial paper issuances outstanding were million 
during fiscal  and  aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and short term bank borrowings ranged from approximately zero to million  zero to million  and zero to million  respectively 
during fiscal  and  our aggregate commercial paper issuances and short term bank borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of  and  respectively 
fixed rate debt included in current maturities of long term debt as of june  are the senior notes totaling million  which mature in march it is our intention to fund the repayment of these notes at maturity through cash on hand  cash flow from operations  issuances of commercial paper  senior notes or a combination thereof 
in february  we filed with the sec an automatically effective well known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and guarantees of debt securities that may be issued from time to time 
in june  we repaid the senior notes totaling million at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances 
in may  we entered into an agreement with a notional amount of million to lock in a component of the interest rate on our then forecasted debt offering 
we designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on a portion of the then forecasted june debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
in june  in conjunction with the issuance of the million senior notes maturing in fiscal  we settled the treasury lock  locking in the effective yields on the related debt 
upon settlement  we received cash of million  which represented the fair value of the swap agreement at the time of settlement 
this amount is being amortized as an offset to interest expense over the year term of the debt  and the unamortized balance is reflected as a gain  net of tax  accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in june  we issued senior notes totaling million due june  the notes and senior notes totaling million due june  the notes under its february shelf registration 
the and notes  which were priced at and of par  respectively  are unsecured  are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows sysco to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by early redemption 
proceeds from the notes will be utilized over a period of time for general corporate purposes  which may include acquisitions  refinancing of debt  working capital  share repurchases and capital expenditures 
in february  we repaid the senior notes totaling million at maturity utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and cash on hand 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal to floating rate debt 
this transaction was entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost and was designated as a fair value hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 
total debt total debt as of june  was billion of which approximately was at fixed rates with a weighted average of and an average life of years  and the remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of and an average life of one year 
certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect note holders  including provisions to maintain the company s long term debt to total capital ratio below a specified level 
we are currently in compliance with all debt covenants 
other as part of normal business activities  we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements 
in addition  in connection with our audits in certain tax jurisdictions  we have posted of letters of credit in order to proceed to the appeals process 
as of june   letters of credit outstanding were million 
other considerations multiemployer pension plans as discussed in note  multiemployer employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements in item  we contribute to several multiemployer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union represented employees 
under certain circumstances  including our voluntary withdrawal or a mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from certain underfunded plans  we would be required to make payments to the plans for our proportionate share of the multiemployer plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
we believe that one of the above mentioned events is reasonably possible with certain plans in which we participate and estimate our share of withdrawal liability for these plans could have been as much as million as of june  and as much as million as of august   based on the latest available information available as of each date 
this estimate excludes plans for which we have recorded withdrawal liabilities or where the likelihood of the above mentioned events is deemed remote 
due to the lack of current information  we believe our current share of the withdrawal liability could materially differ from this estimate 
required contributions to multiemployer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels 
in addition  pension related legislation in the united states requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding 
we believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions  withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity or a combination of these items 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of june   certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments payments due by period more than total year years years years in thousands recorded contractual obligations revolving credit facility borrowings commercial paper long term debt capital lease obligations deferred compensation serp and other postretirement plans multiemployer pension plans unrecognized tax benefits and interest unrecorded contractual obligations interest payments related to debt retirement plan long term non capitalized leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the estimate of the timing of future payments under the executive deferred compensation plan involves the use of certain assumptions  including retirement ages and payout periods 
includes estimated contributions to the unfunded serp and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal  based on actuarial assumptions 
represents voluntary withdrawal liabilities recorded and excludes normal contributions required under our collective bargaining agreements 
unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions 
as of june   we had a liability of million for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and million for related interest that could result in cash payment 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of non current payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time 
accordingly  the related non current balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 
includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of june   assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity  and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates 
the impact of our outstanding fixed to floating interest rate swap on the fixed rate debt interest payments is included as well based on the floating rates in effect as of june  provides the estimated minimum contribution to the retirement plan through fiscal to meet erisa minimum funding requirements under the assumption that we only make minimum funding requirement contributions each year  based on actuarial assumptions 
for purposes of this table  purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business  for which all significant terms have been confirmed  including minimum quantities resulting from our sourcing initiative 
such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates 
purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with various third party service providers to provide information technology services for period up to fiscal see discussion under note  commitments and contingencies  to the notes to consolidated financial statements in item  fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments 
purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required 
certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration  typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved 
aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of june  were million 
this amount is not included in the table above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements 
significant accounting policies employed by sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  self insurance programs  company sponsored pension plans  income taxes  vendor consideration  goodwill and intangible assets and share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
we utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off  including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy  has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods 
allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write offs and recoveries 
in addition  in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
self insurance program we maintain a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation  general liability and vehicle liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
we also maintain a fully self insured group medical program 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  medical cost trends  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
in an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims  safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented 
company sponsored pension plans amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
two of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
our retirement plan was frozen in fiscal and is only open to a small number of employees 
our serp was frozen in fiscal due to these plan freezes  our assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation is no longer a critical assumption 
for guidance in determining the discount rates  we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan 
the discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the retirement plan  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  decreased basis points to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  decreased basis points to 
the serp was remeasured during fiscal upon approval to freeze the plan 
the remeasured discount rate was 
the combined effect of these discount rate changes increased our net company sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated million 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the retirement plan  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  increased basis points to 
the discount rate for determining fiscal net pension costs for the serp  which was determined as of the june  measurement date  increased basis points to  as compared to the discount rate upon the remeasurement of the plan during fiscal the combined effect of these discount rate changes will decrease our net company sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal by an estimated million 
a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rates for fiscal would decrease or increase sysco s net company sponsored pension cost by million 
now that sysco s pension plans are frozen  net company sponsored pension cost is not as sensitive to discount rate changes as compared to when these plans were active 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan was for fiscal and fiscal the expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns  reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on bonds  historical returns of the major stock markets and returns on alternative investments 
although not determinative of future returns  the effective annual rate of return on plan assets  developed using geometric compound averaging  was approximately    and  over the year  year  year and year periods ended december   respectively 
in addition  in eight of the last years  the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 
the rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate 
the expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of the retirement plan is for fiscal a basis point increase decrease in the assumed rate of return for fiscal would decrease increase sysco s net company sponsored pension costs for fiscal by approximately million 
pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june  was a charge  net of tax  of million 
the amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of june  was a charge  net of tax  of million 
we made cash contributions to our company sponsored pension plans of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the million contribution to the retirement plan in fiscal was voluntary  as there was no minimum required contribution for the calendar plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements 
the million contribution to the retirement plan in fiscal exceeded the minimum required contribution for the calendar plan year to meet erisa minimum funding requirements 
there are no required contributions to the retirement plan to meet erisa minimum funding requirements in fiscal the estimated fiscal contributions to fund benefit payments for the serp plan are approximately million 
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state  as well as foreign jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances  and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  however  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities  our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
vendor consideration we recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by sysco 
there are several types of cash consideration received from vendors 
in many instances  the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound 
in these instances  we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
in some instances  vendor consideration is received upon receipt of inventory in our distribution facilities 
we estimate the amount needed to reduce our inventory based on inventory turns until the product is sold 
our inventory turnover is usually less than one month  therefore  amounts deferred against inventory do not require long term estimation 
in the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases  we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete  the related service is performed and the amounts realized 
historically  adjustments to our estimates related to vendor consideration have not been significant 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired  including goodwill and other intangible assets  as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  annually in our fourth quarter or more frequently as needed  we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets 
the reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our ten operating segments as described in note  business segment information  to the consolidated financial statements in item the components within each of our ten operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into ten reporting units 
we arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models 
the results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our ten operating segments 
we use a weighting for our discounted cash flow valuation and for the earnings multiple models giving greater emphasis to our discounted cash flow model because the forecasted operating results that serve as a basis for the analysis incorporate management s outlook and anticipated changes for the businesses consistent with a market participant 
the primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums  earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by sysco in the past  future cash flow estimates of the reporting units  which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates  and weighted average cost of capital  along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
when possible  we use observable market inputs in our models to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units 
we update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units 
our estimates of fair value contain uncertainties requiring management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections  resulting in the company revising its assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
there were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles recorded as a result of assessment in fiscal  or our past estimates of fair value for fiscal and have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years actual results 
sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units 
in the fiscal analysis our estimates of fair value did not require additional analysis  however  we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for the following reporting units if our estimates of fair value were decreased by the following amounts 
first  our specialty produce operations would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been lower 
second  our european broadline company would have required additional analysis if the estimated fair value had been lower 
as of june   these two reporting units had goodwill aggregating million 
for the remainder of our reporting units  which as of june  had goodwill aggregating billion  we would have performed additional analysis to determine if an impairment existed for a reporting unit if the estimated fair value for any of these reporting units had declined by greater than 
certain reporting units caribbean broadline  european broadline  specialty produce  custom cut meat  lodging industry products  imported specialty products and international distribution operations have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the united states broadline  canadian broadline or sygma reporting units 
this is primarily due to these businesses having been more recently acquired  and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the united states broadline  canadian broadline and sygma reporting units 
in addition  these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the united states broadline reporting unit 
as such  these reporting units have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn 
share based compensation we provide compensation benefits to employees and non employee directors under several share based payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans  the employees stock purchase plan  the management incentive plan and various non employee director plans 
as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of sysco s stock  implied volatilities from traded options on sysco s stock and other factors 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of each restricted stock unit award granted with a dividend equivalent is based on the company s stock price as of the date of grant 
for restricted stock units granted without dividend equivalents  the fair value is reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period 
the fair value of the stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price 
the fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based on the stock price on grant date 
the application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a post vesting restriction 
the compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period 
the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the employees stock purchase plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made 
our share based awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period 
we will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in addition  certain of our share based awards provide that the awards continue to vest as if the award holder continued to be an employee or director if the award holder meets certain age and years of service thresholds upon retirement 
in these cases  we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the grant date to the date the employee or director first becomes eligible to retire with the options continuing to vest after retirement 
our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes 
in the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded  a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options 
we may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option 
in such cases  we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate 
forward looking statements certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express management s expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of they include statements about sysco s ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings  expectations regarding pricing and margin pressure  cost per case reductions and sales case growth  the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business  sales and expense trends  including without limitation  expectations regarding defined contribution plan costs and pension costs  anticipated multiemployer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multiemployer pension plans  expectations regarding potential payments of unrecognized tax benefits and interest  expectations regarding share repurchases  dividend payments  expected trends in fuel pricing  usage costs and surcharges  our expectation regarding the provision for losses on accounts receivable  expected implementation  costs and benefits of the erp system  estimated expenses and capital expenditures related to our business transformation project  beliefs regarding future erp conversions at our operating companies  expectations regarding our other business transformation initiatives including cost transformation and product cost reduction and category management initiatives  beliefs regarding the timeline for the realization of benefits from each of our initiatives within our business transformation project  expectation regarding the number of long term contracts increasing as we progress with our category management initiative  our plan to continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core foodservice distribution business  expectations regarding future acquisitions and the contributions of acquisitions to our business and future revenues  sygma s growth prospects in fiscal  the loss of sygma s largest customer not having a material adverse effect on sysco as a whole  compliance with laws and government regulations not having a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position  anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures and the sources of financing for them  continued competitive advantages and positive results from strategic initiatives  expectations that depreciation and amortization expense will increase at a lower rate in fiscal than the rate in fiscal  expectations that depreciation and amortization expense will increase at a lower rate in fiscal than the rate in fiscal  anticipated company sponsored pension plan liabilities  our expectations regarding cash flow from operations  our intentions regarding the repayment of debt  the impact of initiatives to improve working capital  the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities  predictions regarding the impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses  the anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sysco s ability to meet future cash requirements 
these statements are based on management s current expectations and estimates  actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at item a in the annual report on form k and elsewhere 
in addition  the success of sysco s strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses  including fuel costs 
expected trends related to fuel costs and usage are impacted by fluctuations in the economy generally and numerous factors affecting the oil industry that are beyond our control 
our efforts to lower our cost of goods sold may be impacted by factors beyond our control  including actions by our competitors and or customers 
we have experienced delays in the implementation of our business transformation project and the expected costs of our business transformation project may be greater or less than currently expected  as we may encounter the need for changes in design or revisions of the project calendar and budget 
our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems  scheduling delays  cost overages  or limitations on the extent of the business transformation during the erp implementation process 
as implementation of the erp system and other initiatives within the business transformation project begins  there may be changes in design or timing that impact near term expense and cause us to revise the project calendar and budget  and additional hiring and training of employees and consultants may be required  which could also impact project expense and timing 
our business transformation project initiatives related to erp implementation  cost transformation and produce cost reduction may not provide the expected benefits or cost savings in a timely fashion  if at all 
if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our cost cutting efforts  we could become cost disadvantaged in the marketplace  and our competitiveness and our profitability could decrease 
defined contribution plan costs are impacted by the number of employees participating in the plan and the level of contributions made by each employee 
company sponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits  the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
the amount of shares repurchased in a given period is subject to a number of factors  including available cash and our general working capital needs at the time 
meeting our dividend target objectives depends on our level of earnings 
our plans with respect to growth in international markets and adjacent areas that complement our core business are subject to the company s other strategic initiatives and plans and economic conditions generally 
legal proceedings are impacted by events  circumstances and individuals beyond the control of sysco 
the need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by factors that include capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated  stock repurchases at historical levels  or other unexpected cash requirements 
plans regarding the repayment of debt are subject to change at any time based on management s assessment of the overall needs of the company 
the anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect  and laws and regulations  as well as methods of enforcement  are subject to change 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
our use of debt directly exposes us to interest rate risk 
floating rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates periodically  exposes us to short term changes in market interest rates 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes us to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that we may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at higher rates 
we manage our debt portfolio to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates and may employ interest rate swaps as a tool to achieve that position 
the major risks from interest rate derivatives include changes in the interest rates affecting the fair value of such instruments  potential increases in interest expense due to market increases in floating interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparties in such transactions 
fiscal as of june   we had million of commercial paper outstanding 
total debt as of june  was billion  of which approximately was at fixed rates of interest  including the impact of our interest rate swap agreement 
in fiscal  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal the fiscal swap and million of fixed rate debt maturing in fiscal the fiscal swap to floating rate debt 
both transactions were entered into with the goal of reducing overall borrowing cost 
these transactions were designated as fair value hedges since the swaps hedge against the changes in fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from changes in interest rates 
the swap agreement related to the fiscal debt was settled upon maturity of the senior notes in february  leaving one remaining outstanding swap agreement as of june  as of june   the fiscal swap was recognized as an asset within the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
the fixed interest rate on the hedged debt is and the floating interest rate on the swap is three month libor which resets quarterly

total debt as of june  was billion  of which approximately was at fixed rates of interest  including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 
in may  we entered into an agreement with a notional amount of million to lock in a component of the interest rate on our then forecasted debt offering 
we designated this derivative as a cash flow hedge of the variability in the cash outflows of interest payments on a portion of the june forecasted debt issuance due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
in june  in conjunction with the issuance of the million senior notes maturing in fiscal  we settled the treasury lock  locking in the effective yields on the related debt

to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in a foreign subsidiary s functional currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we will also incur gains and losses within our shareholders equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into us dollars 
our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars 
the changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into us dollars did not have a significant impact on sales in fiscal when compared to fiscal or in fiscal when compared to fiscal the impact to our operating income  net earnings and earnings per share was not material in fiscal or fiscal a unfavorable change in the fiscal weighted year to date exchange rate and the resulting impact on our financial statements would have negatively impacted fiscal sales by and would not have materially impacted our operating income  net earnings and earnings per share 
we do not routinely enter into material agreements to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risks 
fuel price risk due to the nature of our distribution business  we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices 
the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production  seasonality and other market factors generally outside of our control 
increased fuel costs may have a negative impact on our results of operations in three areas 
first  the high cost of fuel can negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending and thus reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers for food away from home purchases 
second  the high cost of fuel can increase the price we pay for product purchases and we may not be able to pass these costs fully to our customers 
third  increased fuel costs impact the costs we incur to deliver product to our customers 
during fiscal  and  fuel costs related to outbound deliveries represented approximately  and of sales  respectively 
fuel costs  excluding any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  incurred by sysco increased by approximately million in fiscal from fiscal and by million in fiscal over fiscal we routinely enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements 
as of june   we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately million through august these contracts will lock in the price of approximately to of our fuel purchase needs for the contracted periods at prices slightly lower than the current market price for diesel 
assuming that fuel prices do not rise significantly over recent levels during fiscal  fuel costs  exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges  are expected to increase by approximately to million as compared to fiscal our estimate is based upon current  published quarterly market price projections for diesel  the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal and estimates of fuel consumption 
actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change  in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates 
a unfavorable change in diesel prices from the market price used in our estimates above would result in a potential increase of million to million 
investment risk our company sponsored qualified pension plan retirement plan holds investments in public and private equity  fixed income securities and real estate funds 
the amount of our annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon  among other things  the return on the plan s assets and discount rates used to calculate the plan s liability 
fluctuations in asset values can cause the amount of our anticipated future contributions to the plan to increase and can result in a reduction to shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of fiscal year end  which is when this plan s funded status is measured 
also  the projected liability of the plan will be impacted by the fluctuations of interest rates on high quality bonds in the public markets 
to the extent the financial markets experience declines  our anticipated future contributions and funded status will be affected for future years 
a unfavorable change in the value of the investments held by our company sponsored retirement plan at the plan s fiscal year end december  would not have a material impact on our anticipated future contributions for fiscal  however  this unfavorable change would increase our pension expense for fiscal by million and would reduce our shareholders equity on our balance sheet as of june  by million
