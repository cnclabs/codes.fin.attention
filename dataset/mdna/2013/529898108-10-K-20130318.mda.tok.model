additionally  for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three years  the following should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes 
general overview headquartered in toledo  ohio  we believe that we have the largest manufacturing  distribution and service network among glass tableware manufacturers in the western hemisphere and that we are one of the largest glass tableware manufacturers in the world 
our product portfolio consists of an extensive line of high quality  machine made glass tableware  including casual glass beverageware  in addition to ceramic dinnerware  metal flatware  hollowware and serveware 
we sell our products to foodservice  retail  and business to business customers in over countries  with our sales to customers within north america accounting for approximately percent of our total sales 
we are the largest manufacturer and marketer of casual glass beverageware in north america for the foodservice and retail channels

we have two reportable segments defined as follows glass operations includes worldwide sales of manufactured and sourced glass tableware and other glass products from domestic and international subsidiaries 
other operations includes worldwide sales of sourced ceramic dinnerware  metal tableware  hollowware and serveware and plastic items 
plastic items were included in this segment until we sold substantially all of the assets of our traex subsidiary on april  when discussing sales by region throughout this section  region is defined as our sales force s regional sales accountability 

table of contents executive overview overall  the economies in which we operate continued to be challenging during and we expect them to remain fragile into north america economy was fragile with political and global economic uncertainties continuing to lead to relatively weak demand 
the european economy continued to soften throughout in addition  political uncertainty existed in china as a result of the leadership change there  and although the economy in china continues to grow  the rate of growth has slowed considerably in the latter half of despite these conditions  we achieved a number of financial highlights in resulting from our commitment to improving our cost structure while leveraging our leadership positions in key lines of business and strengthening our balance sheet 
among them are the following  all of which are company records net sales were million 
gross profit of million surpassed gross profit by percent 
income from operations of million  an increase of percent over adjusted ebitda of million  surpassing our previous best in of million 
working capital defined as net accounts receivable and inventory less accounts payable was million at december   compared to million at december  working capital as a percent of net sales was percent at december   an all time record low  as compared to percent at december  strengthening our balance sheet remains a high priority 
on may   we completed the refinancing of substantially all of the existing indebtedness of our wholly owned subsidiaries libbey glass and libbey europe 
we used the proceeds of the offering of the million new senior secured notes to fund the repurchase and redemption of million of the old senior secured notes  pay related fees and expenses  and contribute million to our us pension plans to fully fund our target obligations under erisa 
on june   we used the remaining proceeds of the new senior secured notes  together with cash on hand  to redeem the remaining million of old senior secured notes and to pay related fees 
in april and september of  libbey china pre paid the respective july and december scheduled principal payments of rmb million approximately million each 
in addition we repaid million approximately million on our loan in portugal 
as of december   we had available capacity of million under our abl credit facility  with no loans currently outstanding and million in cash on hand 
we plan for libbey glass inc to redeem million of our percent new senior secured notes during the second quarter of libbey continues to successfully implement libbey  our comprehensive business strategy launched in to improve our financial position and our ability to compete effectively in the market today and into the future 
libbey is centered on reducing our costs and boosting efficiency  reinforcing our leadership position in key channels particularly us foodservice and mexico foodservice and retail  accelerating growth in china and reducing our liabilities and the working capital required to operate the core business 
in february  we announced our plan to exit sales of certain glassware items  realign production in north america and reduce manufacturing capacity at our shreveport  louisiana facility 
some production will be relocated to our facilities in toledo  ohio and monterrey  mexico 
existing staff will handle the relocated production in toledo and monterrey 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
the implementation of the strategic plan is an ongoing process 
in the first quarter of  we have planned significant rebuilds and capacity expansion at our mexico facility along with associated under utilization of capacity 
however  for the full year we expect to realize year over year revenue growth in the low to mid single digit range and ebitda improvements that will reflect the benefits of the cost reductions put in place in the second half of

we sometimes refer to data derived from consolidated financial information but not required by gaap to be presented in financial statements 
certain of these data are considered non gaap financial measures under securities and exchange commission sec regulation g 
we believe that non gaap data provide investors with a more complete understanding of underlying results in our core business and trends 
in addition  we use non gaap data internally to assess performance 
although we believe that the non gaap financial measures presented enhance investors understanding of our business and performance  these non gaap measures should not be considered an alternative to gaap 
we define ebit as net income before interest expense and income taxes 
the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure is net income 
we believe that ebit is an important supplemental measure for investors in evaluating operating performance in that it provides insight into company profitability 
libbey s senior management uses this measure internally to measure profitability 
ebit also allows for a measure of comparability to other companies with different capital and legal structures  which accordingly may be subject to different interest rates and effective tax rates 
the non gaap measure of ebit does have certain limitations 
it does not include interest expense  which is a necessary and ongoing part of our cost structure resulting from debt incurred to expand operations 
because this is a material and recurring item  any measure that excludes it has a material limitation 
ebit may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we define ebitda as net income before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure is net income 

table of contents we believe that ebitda is an important supplemental measure for investors in evaluating operating performance in that it provides insight into company profitability and cash flow 
libbey s senior management uses this measure internally to measure profitability and to set performance targets for managers 
ebitda also allows for a measure of comparability to other companies with different capital and legal structures  which accordingly may be subject to different interest rates and effective tax rates  and to companies that may incur different depreciation and amortization expenses or impairment charges 
the non gaap measure of ebitda does have certain limitations 
it does not include interest expense  which is a necessary and ongoing part of our cost structure resulting from debt incurred to expand operations 
ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expenses 
because these are material and recurring items  any measure that excludes them has a material limitation 
ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance 
in addition  we use adjusted ebitda internally to measure profitability and to set performance targets for managers 
adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
net income and diluted net income per share we recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  in  compared to million  or per diluted share  in net income as a percentage of net sales was percent in  compared to percent in the prior year 
the reduction in net income and diluted net income per share is generally due to the factors discussed in ebit above  a million reduction in interest expense  and a million increase in the provision for income taxes 
the reduction in interest expense is primarily the result of lower interest rates in the last seven months of from refinancing our senior notes 
the effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent in the effective tax rate was influenced by non deductible foreign currency losses related to our mexican operations  an increase in foreign withholding taxes and activity in jurisdictions with recorded valuation allowances and changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates

we used the proceeds of the offering of the million new senior secured notes to fund the repurchase and redemption of million of the old senior secured noes  pay related fees and expenses  and contribute million to our us pension plans to fully fund our target obligations under erisa 
on june   we used the remaining proceeds of the new senior secured notes  together with cash on hand  to redeem the remaining million of old senior secured notes and to pay related fees 
based on our operating plans and current forecast expectations  we anticipate that our level of cash on hand  cash flows from operations and our borrowing capacity under our amended and restated abl facility will provide sufficient cash availability to meet our ongoing liquidity needs 
it is our intent for libbey glass to redeem million of the outstanding new senior secured notes during the second quarter of balance sheet and cash flows cash and equivalents see the cash flow section below for a discussion of our cash balance

working capital  defined as net accounts receivable plus net inventories less accounts payable  decreased by million in  compared to as a percentage of net sales  working capital decreased to an all time record low of percent in  compared to percent in this decrease in working capital is primarily the result of lower accounts receivable and higher accounts payable  partially offset by increased inventory levels due to increased production levels 
the impact of currency increased total working capital by million at december   primarily driven by the mexican peso 
our dso also decreased days compared to year end  which is attributable to timing of receipts near december  the increases in both our inventory and accounts payable are related to a planned furnace rebuild in the first quarter of as a result of the factors above  dwc decreased from at december  to at december  borrowings the following table presents our total borrowings dollars in thousands interest rate maturity date december  december  borrowings under abl facility floating may  new senior secured notes may  old senior secured notes february  promissory note january  to september  notes payable floating january  rmb loan contract floating january  bes euro line floating december  aicep loan january  to july  total borrowings less unamortized discount plus carrying value adjustment on debt related to the interest rate agreement total borrowings net see derivatives below and note to the consolidated financial statements

of our total borrowings  million  or approximately percent  was subject to variable interest rates at december  a change of one percentage point in such rates would result in a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
included in interest expense is the amortization of discounts  warrants and other financing fees 
these items amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents cash flow the following table presents key drivers to our free cash flow for  and year ended december  dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures net proceeds from sale of traex proceeds from asset sales and other payment of interest on pik notes free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from asset sales including the sale of substantially all of the assets of traex  and further adjusted for the payment of interest on the pik notes 
the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure is net cash provided by operating activities 
we believe that free cash flow is important supplemental information for investors in evaluating cash flow performance in that it provides insight into the cash flow available to fund such things as discretionary debt service  acquisitions and other strategic investment opportunities 
it is a measure of performance we use to internally evaluate the overall performance of the business 
free cash flow is used in conjunction with and in addition to results presented in accordance with us gaap 
free cash flow is neither intended to represent nor be an alternative to the measure of net cash provided by used in operating activities recorded under us gaap 
free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
discussion of vs 
cash flow our net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in  or a reduction of million 
the major factors impacting cash flow from operations were the unfavorable cash flow of million in changes from the pension and non pension postretirement benefits  which includes the million contribution to the us pension plans from the new senior secured note proceeds  the million reduction in net income and million from changes in accrued interest and amortization of discounts  warrants and finance fees  partially offset by million of favorable cash flow impact related to our debt refinancing and million change in income taxes resulting primarily from lower tax payments 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in during  we had capital expenditures of million  offset by proceeds of million from asset sales 
during  we had capital expenditures of million  offset by proceeds of million on the sale of substantially all of the assets of traex and million from other asset sales  primarily from the sale of land at our libbey holland facility and syracuse china facility 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was a source of million in  compared to a use of million in  or a change of million

during  we redeemed million of our old senior secured notes and made other debt repayments of million  paid a related call premium of million  partially offset by warrant proceeds of million 
at december   our cash balance was million  an increase of million from million at december  free cash flow was million in  compared to million in  a reduction of million 
the primary contributors to this change were the reduction in cash flows from operating activities  primarily driven by our contribution of million to our us pension plans and the prior year cash proceeds on the sale of traex assets and other asset sales  offset by a decrease in capital expenditures in the current period  all as discussed above

net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in  or a decrease of million 
this change was attributable to a million increase in capital spending offset by net proceeds from the sale of traex of million and other asset sale proceeds of million primarily from the sale of land at our libbey holland facility and syracuse china facility 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was a use of million in  compared to a source of million in  or a change of million

in  free cash flow was adjusted for the million payment of interest on the pik notes that did not repeat in  partially offset by the net proceeds from the sale of traex assets in derivatives at december   we had an interest rate agreement with respect to million of our old senior secured notes old rate agreement in order to convert a portion of the old senior note fixed rate debt into floating rate debt and maintain a capital structure containing appropriate amounts of fixed and floating rate debt 
the interest rate for our borrowings related to the old rate agreement at december  was percent per year 
the old rate agreement was in place through april  on april   we called the old rate agreement at fair value and received proceeds of million 
on june   we entered into an interest rate agreement with a notional amount of million that is to mature in new rate agreement 
the new rate agreement was executed in order to convert a portion of the new senior secured notes fixed rate debt into floating rate debt and maintain a capital structure containing fixed and floating rate debt 
prior to may   but not more than once in any twelve month period  the counterparty may call up to percent of the new rate agreement at a call price of percent 
the new rate agreement is callable at the counterparty s option  in whole or in part  at any time on or after may  at set call premiums 
the variable interest rate for our borrowings related to the new rate agreement at december   excluding applicable fees  is percent 
this new rate agreement expires on may  total remaining new senior secured notes not covered by the new rate agreement have a fixed interest rate of percent per year through may  if the counterparty to this new rate agreement were to fail to perform  this new rate agreement would no longer afford us a variable rate 
however  we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparty 
the interest rate swap counterparty was rated a  as of december   by standard and poor s 
the fair market value for the new rate agreement was a million asset at december  the fair market value for the old rate agreement was a million asset at december  the fair market value of the new rate agreement and the old rate agreement is based on the market standard methodology of netting the discounted expected future fixed cash receipts and the discounted future variable cash payments 
the variable cash payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate forward curves 
we also use commodity futures contracts related to forecasted future north american natural gas requirements 
the objective of these futures contracts is to reduce the effects of fluctuations and price movements in the underlying commodity 
we consider our forecasted natural gas requirements in determining the quantity of natural gas to hedge 
we combine the forecasts with historical observations to establish the percentage of forecast eligible to be hedged  typically ranging from percent to percent of our anticipated requirements up to eighteen months in the future 
the fair values of these instruments are determined from market quotes 
at december   we had commodity futures contracts for  million british thermal units btus of natural gas with a fair market value of a million liability 
we have hedged a portion of our forecasted transactions through december at december   we had commodity futures contracts for  million btus of natural gas with a fair market value of a million liability 
the counterparties for these derivatives were rated bbb or better as of december   by standard poor s 

table of contents we use foreign currency contracts to manage our currency exposure  which arises from transactions denominated in a currency other than us dollar  primarily associated with our canadian dollar denominated accounts receivable 
the fair values of these instruments are determined from market quotes 
the values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
we had currency contracts for million and million canadian dollars as of december  and  respectively 
the fair value of our currency contracts were a minor amount and a million asset at december  and  respectively 
share repurchase program since mid  we have repurchased  shares for million  as authorized by our board of directors 
as of december   authorization remains for the purchase of an additional  shares 
during and  we did not repurchase any common stock 
our debt agreements significantly restrict our ability to repurchase additional shares 
contractual obligations the following table presents our existing contractual obligations at december  and related future cash requirements contractual obligations dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years borrowings interest payments long term operating leases pension and nonpension long term incentive plans total obligations amounts reported in local currencies have been translated at exchange rates 
the obligations for interest payments are based on december  debt levels and interest rates 
it is difficult to estimate future cash contributions as they are a function of actual investment returns  withdrawals from the plan  changes in interest rates  and other factors uncertain at this time 
in addition to the above  we have commercial commitments secured by letters of credit and guarantees 
our letters of credit outstanding at december   totaled million 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when cash settlement with taxing authorities may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits 
therefore  our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is not included in the table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in their preparation 
the areas described below are affected by critical accounting estimates and are impacted significantly by judgments and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
revenue is recorded net of returns  discounts and sales incentive programs offered to customers 
we offer various incentive programs to a broad base of customers  and we record accruals for these as sales occur 
these programs typically offer incentives for purchase activities by customers that include growth objectives 
criteria for payment include the achievement by customers of certain purchase targets and the purchase by customers of particular product types 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of the accruals based on current customer purchases  targeted purchases and payout levels 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of reserves  was million in  compared to million in the reserve balance was million in  compared to million in the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through charges to the provision for bad debts 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical trends in collections and write offs  our judgment as to the probability of collecting accounts and our evaluation of business risk 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to revision as more information becomes available 
accounts are determined to be uncollectible when the debt is deemed to be worthless or only recoverable in part and are written off at that time through a charge against the allowance 
allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimate appropriate allowance provisions accordingly 
we provide inventory allowances based upon excess and obsolete inventories driven primarily by future demand forecasts 
at december   our inventories were million  with loss provisions of million  compared to inventories of million and loss provisions of million at december  asset impairment fixed assets we assess our property  plant and equipment for possible impairment in accordance with fasb asc topic  property plant and equipment fasb asc  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable or a revision of remaining useful lives is necessary 
such indicators may include economic and competitive conditions  changes in our business plans or management intentions regarding future utilization of the assets or changes in our commodity prices 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of an asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
the determination of fair value is based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value or on a market appraisal 
projections used in the fair value determination are based on internal estimates for sales and production levels  capital expenditures necessary to maintain the projected production levels  and remaining useful life of the assets 
these projections are prepared at the lowest level at which we have access to cash flow information and complete financial data for our operations  which is generally at the plant level 
determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves significant management judgment involving highly uncertain matters  including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  future selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets  and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
however  the impairment reviews and calculations are based on estimates and assumptions that take into account our business plans and long term investment decisions 
there were no indicators of impairment noted in and that required an impairment analysis to be performed for the company property  plant and equipment 
during  we decided to outsource our us decorating business  which represented an indicator of impairment for that asset group 
accordingly  our impairment analysis resulted in a write down of our carrying value for those assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell 
also in  we reviewed the remaining carrying value of our land at the syracuse china manufacturing facility  which resulted in a write down of our carrying value for the land 
we also reviewed other asset groups within our operations for indicators of impairment  and as a result recorded an impairment charge for certain fixed assets during and as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with fasb asc  we also perform an impairment analysis for our definite useful lived intangible assets when factors indicating impairment are present 
there were no indicators of impairment noted in or that would require an impairment analysis to be performed for our definite useful lived intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets goodwill at december  was million  representing approximately percent of total assets 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of assets acquired for each reporting unit 
our reporting units are one level below the operating segment level  which represents the lowest level of the business for which financial statements are prepared internally  and may represent a single facility operating component or a group of plants under a common management team 
goodwill impairment tests are completed for each reporting unit as of october of each year  or more frequently in certain circumstances where impairment indicators arise 
when performing our test for impairment  we use an approach which includes a discounted cash flow analysis  incorporating the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
table of contents to compute the fair value of each reporting unit 
these cash flow projections are based in part on sales projections for the next several years  capital spending trends and investment in working capital to support anticipated sales growth  which are updated at least annually and reviewed by management 
the fair value is then compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment exists 
however  to the extent the carrying value exceeds fair value  we compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its book value to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded 
the discount rates used in present value calculations are updated annually 
we also use available market value information to evaluate fair value 
the total of the fair values of the segments less debt was reconciled to end of year total market capitalization 
for locations with recorded goodwill  the discount rates used in the goodwill impairment analysis ranged from percent to percent  as compared to a range of percent to percent used in the test 
the cash flow terminal growth rates used in the goodwill impairment analysis for all locations ranged from percent to percent  as compared to a range of percent to percent in the goodwill impairment analysis 
management believes these rates are reasonably conservative based upon historical growth rates and its expectations of future economic conditions in the markets in which we operate 
any changes in the discount rate or cash flow terminal growth rate would move in tandem 
for example  the discount rate is lower in part due to decreased uncertainty as to our ability to meet short term and long term forecasts 
as such  if we were to increase the cash flow terminal growth rate  we would also increase the discount rate 
the discounted cash flow model used to determine fair value for the goodwill analysis is most sensitive to the discount rate and terminal cash flow growth rate assumptions 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on these factors for all reporting units and it was determined  assuming all other assumptions remain constant  that the discount rate used could be increased by a factor of percent of the discount rate or the terminal cash flow growth rate could decrease to zero and the fair value of all reporting units with goodwill would still exceed their carrying values 
significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the segments and the recoverability of goodwill or differences between estimates and actual results could result in impairment charges in the future 
based on the results of our annual impairment test  the estimated fair values of all three reporting units that have goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values  with the estimated fair values of each reporting unit exceeding its carrying value by at least percent 
as of october   and  our review did not indicate an impairment of goodwill 
individual indefinite life intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently in certain circumstances where impairment indicators arise 
total indefinite life intangible assets at december  were million  representing percent of total assets 
when performing our test for impairment  we use a discounted cash flow method based on a relief from royalty calculation to compute the fair value  which is then compared to the carrying value of the indefinite life intangible asset 
to the extent that fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment exists 
this was done as of october st for each year presented 
as of october   and  our review did not indicate an impairment of indefinite life intangible assets 
self insurance reserves we use self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities related to workers compensation and employee health care benefits that are not covered by third party insurance 
workers compensation accruals are recorded at the estimated ultimate payout amounts based on individual case estimates 
in addition  we record estimates of incurred but not reported losses based on actuarial models 
although we believe that the estimated liabilities for self insurance are adequate  the estimates described above may not be indicative of current and future losses 
in addition  the actuarial calculations used to estimate self insurance liabilities are based on numerous assumptions  some of which are subjective 
we will continue to adjust our estimated liabilities for self insurance  as deemed necessary  in the event that future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns 

table of contents pension assumptions the assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations were as follows us plans non us plans discount rate to to to to rate of compensation increase to to to to the assumptions used to determine net periodic pension costs were as follows us plans non us plans discount rate to to to to to to expected long term rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase to to to to to to two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  are important elements of plan expense and asset liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions on our annual measurement date of december other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year often will differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the discount rate enables us to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
the rate used reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments at our december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
our determination of the reasonableness of our expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december is highly quantitative by nature and used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
we evaluate the current asset allocations and expected returns under four sets of conditions a maximum time available for each asset class  a common history where all asset class returns are computed with the same overall start date of january  a year historical return  and forecasted returns using the black litterman method 
based upon the current asset allocation mix and the black litterman method  the forecasted return is percent 
the actual return on plan assets from july  inception through december  was percent and percent for the us hourly and salary pension plans  respectively 
since over percent of the plan assets are actively managed  we adjust the baseline forecasted return for the anticipated return differential from active over passive investment management and for any other items not already captured 
we believe that the combination of long term historical returns  along with the forecasted returns and manager alpha  supports the rate of return assumption based on the current asset allocation 
sensitivity to changes in key assumptions based on year end data is as follows a change of percent in the discount rate would change our total pension expense by approximately million 
a change of percent in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change total pension expense by approximately million 
nonpension postretirement assumptions we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs  to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree welfare plan 
the discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected retiree medical benefits at our december measurement date 
the discount 
table of contents rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the discount rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was us plans non us plans discount rate the discount rate used to determine net postretirement benefit cost was us plans non us plans discount rate the weighted average assumed health care cost trend rates at december were as follows us plans non us plans initial health care trend ultimate health care trend years to reach ultimate trend rate sensitivity to change in key assumptions is as follows a change of percent in the discount rate would change the nonpension postretirement expense by million 
a change of percent in the health care trend rate would not have a material impact upon the nonpension postretirement expense 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions 
management judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
throughout the course of business  there are numerous transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
when management believes certain tax positions may be challenged despite our belief that the tax return positions are supportable  we establish reserves for tax uncertainties based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these reserves taking into consideration changing facts and circumstances  such as an outcome of a tax audit 
the income tax provision includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb asc topic income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax attribute carry forwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
fasb asc income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct our operations or otherwise incur taxable income or losses 
in the united states  portugal and the netherlands  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets 
derivatives and hedging we use various derivative contracts to manage a variety of our risks  including risks related to changes in the fair market of debt  commodity prices and foreign currency rates 
the requirements necessary to apply hedge accounting to these contracts are complex and must be documented at the inception as well as throughout the term of the contract 
if we would fail to accurately document these requirements  the contract would not be eligible for hedge accounting treatment and any changes to the fair market value of the contract would be recorded directly to earnings 
the accompanying financial statements reflect immaterial consequences from the loss of hedge accounting for certain contracts 

table of contents one of the requirements that we must evaluate when determining whether a contract qualifies for hedge accounting treatment is whether or not the contract is deemed effective 
a contract is deemed effective if the change in the fair value of the derivative contract offsets  within a specified range  the change in the fair value of the hedged item 
at the inception of the contract  we first determine if the relationship between the hedged contract and the hedged item meets the strict criteria to qualify for an exemption to the effectiveness testing 
if the relationship does not meet these criteria  then we must test the effectiveness at the inception of the contract and quarterly thereafter 
if the relationship fails this test at any time  we are required to discontinue hedge accounting treatment prospectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation expense we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation and fasb asc  equity equity based payments to non employees  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors 
stock based compensation expense recognized under fasb asc and fasb asc for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
included non cash compensation charges of million related to accelerated vesting of previously issued equity compensation 
we estimate the value of employee share based compensation on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the award  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the use of the black scholes model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
restructuring accruals have been recorded in conjunction with our restructuring actions 
these accruals include estimates primarily related to facility consolidations and closures  employment reductions and contract termination costs 
actual costs may vary from these estimates 
restructuring related accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis  and changes to restructuring actions are appropriately recognized when identified 
legal and other contingencies we are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and claims  including commercial or contractual disputes  product liability claims and environmental and other matters  that arise in the normal course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  by consulting with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
we have accrued for estimated losses in accordance with gaap for those matters where we believe that the likelihood that a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
the determination of the amount of such reserves is based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current matters and consultation with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
the amount of such reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 
at december   we have accrued million for an ongoing unclaimed property audit that is being conducted by various state authorities

this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
in december  asu was modified by the issuance of accounting standards update  comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu which defers certain paragraphs of asu that would require reclassifications of items from other comprehensive income to net income by component of net income and by component of other comprehensive income 
we have made all of the required disclosures within our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued accounting standards update  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
asu allows for an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying amount 
if the qualitative factors result in the fair value exceeding the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  then the fair value does not need to be calculated 
this update is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted

asu requires companies to present  either in a note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements  the effect of amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification 
this update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we will include the additional disclosures in our consolidated financial statements beginning on january  item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk currency we are exposed to market risks due to changes in currency values  although the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in the us dollar 
the currency market risks include devaluations and other major currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar  canadian dollar  euro  rmb or mexican peso that could reduce the cost competitiveness of our products compared to foreign competition 
interest rates we have an interest rate agreement new rate agreement with respect to million of debt in order to convert a portion of the new senior secured notes fixed rate debt into floating rate debt and maintain a capital structure containing fixed and floating rate debt 
the interest rate for our borrowings related to the new rate agreement at december  is percent per year 
the new rate agreement expires on february  total remaining new senior secured notes not covered by the new rate agreement have a fixed interest rate of percent 
if the counterparty to the new rate agreement were to fail to perform  the new rate agreement would no longer provide the desired results 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty  which was rated a as of december   by standard and poor s 
natural gas we are also exposed to market risks associated with changes in the price of natural gas 
we use commodity futures contracts related to forecasted future natural gas requirements of our manufacturing operations in north america 
the objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid and potential volatility in earnings or cash flows from price movements in the underlying natural gas commodity 
we consider the forecasted natural gas requirements of our manufacturing operations in determining the quantity of natural gas to hedge 
we combine the forecasts with historical observations to establish the percentage of forecast to be hedged  typically ranging from percent to percent of our anticipated requirements up to six quarters in the future 
for our natural gas requirements that are not hedged  we are subject to changes in the price of natural gas  which affect our earnings 
if the counterparties to these futures contracts were to fail to perform  we would no longer be protected from natural gas fluctuations by the futures contracts 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by these counterparties 
all counterparties were rated bbb or better by standard and poor s as of december  
table of contents retirement plans we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets 
changes in long term interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure our benefit obligations and related expense 
changes in the equity and debt securities markets affect the performance of our pension plans asset performance and related pension expense 
sensitivity to these key market risk factors is as follows a change of percent in the discount rate would change our total annual pension and nonpension postretirement expense by approximately million 
a change of percent in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change annual pension expense by approximately million
