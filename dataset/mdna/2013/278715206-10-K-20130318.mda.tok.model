the company tax provision for the year  before the effect of discrete items  was an expense of million and reflects an effective tax rate as compared to the effective tax rate for the same period a year earlier

our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows provided by our operating activities  our revolving credit facility  and cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we intend to utilize cash flows generated by our ongoing operating activities  in combination with possibly expanding our commercial lending facility  and the possible issuance of additional equity or debt securities to fund capital expenditures and organic growth initiatives  to make strategic business acquisitions  to retire outstanding indebtedness  and to possibly repurchase shares of our common stock as market and operating conditions warrant 
the company also intends to use a portion of its operating cash flows to continue issuing dividends to its shareholders in the foreseeable future  while remaining dedicated to using most of its cash to generate improvement in future earnings by funding organic growth initiatives and accretive business acquisitions 

table of contents we believe that anticipated cash flow provided by our operating activities  together with current cash balances and access to our credit facilities and the capital markets  if required  will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months  and the foreseeable future thereafter  although any projections of future cash needs  cash flows  and the general market conditions for credit and equity securities may be subject to substantial uncertainty 
in the event additional liquidity needs arise  we may raise funds from a combination of sources  including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
however  there are no assurances that such financing facilities will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we continue to strategically evaluate our ability to sell additional equity or debt securities  and to expand existing or obtain new credit facilities from lenders in order to strengthen our financial position 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in dilution to our shareholders 
we regularly evaluate our liquidity requirements  including the need for additional debt or equity offerings  when considering potential business acquisitions  development of new products or services  or the retirement of debt 
during the company intends to utilize its cash and other financing resources towards making strategic accretive acquisitions in the insurance data exchange arena  to fund new product development and service offerings  and to fund organic growth initiatives 
our cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company holds material cash and cash equivalent balances overseas in foreign jurisdictions 
the free flow of cash from certain countries where we hold such balances may be subject to repatriation tax effects and other restrictions 
furthermore  the repatriation of earnings from some of our foreign subsidiaries would result in the application of withholding taxes at source and taxation at the us parent level upon receipt of the repatriation amounts 
the approximate cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balances held in our domestic us operations and each of our foreign subsidiaries as of march  is presented in table below figures denominated in thousands united states canada latin america australia singapore new zealand india europe sweden total cash and st investments due to the effect of temporary or timing differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes and minimum alternative tax obligations in the us and india  future cash outlays for income taxes are expected to exceed our current income tax expense but will not adversely impact the company s liquidity position 
specifically our software and product development operations in india benefit from a tax holiday which will continue through  as such the company local india taxable income derived from export activities in support of our operating divisions around the world is not taxed 
after the tax holiday expires such taxable income generated by our india operations will be taxed at of the normal indian corporate tax rate for a period of five years 
during the tax holiday in india had the effect of reducing income tax expense by million or approximately per diluted share 
however the company operating cash savings in regards to outlays for taxes  was effectively only million  since million of minimum alternative tax mat taxes were assessed and paid against income during the year ended december   as advance payments made in for taxes due beyond in india 
the company also has a relatively low income tax rate in singapore in which our operations are taxed at a marginal tax rate as a result of concessions granted by the local singapore economic development board for the benefit of in country intellectual property owners 
the concessionary income tax rate will expire after  at which time our singapore operations will be subject to the prevailing corporate tax rate in singapore  currently  unless the company reaches a subsequent agreement to extend the incentive period and the then applicable concessionary rate 
the concessionary tax rate granted by the edb as compared to the statutory tax in effect in singapore improved net income by million or approximately per diluted share in our current ratio improved to at december  as compared to at december   and our working capital position increased to million at december  as compared to million at the end of the improvement in our short term liquidity position is primarily due to an increase in available cash resources as supported by our operating activities and increased trade accounts receivable associated with our growing business 
we believe that our ability to generate sustainable robust cash flow from operations will enable the company to continue to fund its current liabilities from current assets including available cash balances for the foreseeable future

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements the following is a brief discussion of recently released accounting pronouncements that are pertinent to the company s business in july  the fasb issued new technical guidance regarding an entity evaluation of indefinite lived intangible assets for possible impairment 
under this new guidance an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance the related technical accounting guidance 
under this guidance an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
this new technical guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before july   if a public entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued 
the company has not yet adopted this new guidance  and accordingly applied quantitative methods to evaluate its indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment during the company will adopt the new technical guidance in in june  the fasb issued new financial reporting guidance regarding the reporting of other comprehensive income  or oci 
this guidance revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
the new guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income  or two separate but consecutive statements 
under the two statement approach  the first statement would include components of net income  which is consistent with the income statement format used currently  and the second statement would include components of oci 
under either method  entities must display adjustments for items that are reclassified from oci to net income in both net income and oci 
the new reporting guidance does not change the items that must be reported in oci 
this new reporting standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   however  the fasb recently decided to defer the effective date for the part of this new guidance that would require adjustments of items out of accumulated other income to be presented as components of both net income and other comprehensive income in financial statements 
those changes would have been effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after december   but are now deferred until fasb can adequately evaluate the costs and benefits of this presentation requirement 
after adoption  the guidance must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented in the financial statements 
the company adopted this new guidance during it did not have a material impact on our financial position or operating results as the only element of comprehensive income relevant to ebix is in regards to cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments 
in september  the fasb issued new technical guidance regarding an entity evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment 
under this new guidance an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step quantitative impairment test is unnecessary 
this new technical guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption was permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment evaluations performed as of a date before september  if an entity financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued 
the company elected to adopt early and accordingly applied this new guidance to its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill 
in december  the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached consensus regarding the disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations 
this new guidance addressed the diversity in practice concerning the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the guidance specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments affect any public entity that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
the new guidance was applicable to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company adopted this new guidance in and applied it to the disclosures regarding our recent acquisitions of adam  health connect  bsi  taimma  planetsoft  fintechnix  and trisystems 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued new guidance regarding disclosures about fair value measurements 
the guidance requires additional disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in earlier related guidance 
specifically this new guidance requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  and for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements 
also a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this new guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the company adopted and applied this technical guidance in application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as promulgated in the united states  requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve the use of critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information about these policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are limited based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenues primarily from professional and support services  which includes subscription and transaction fees pertaining to services delivered over our exchanges or from our asp platforms  revenue generated from software development projects and associated fees for consulting  implementation  training  and project management provided to customers with installed systems  and business process outsourcing revenue 
sales and value added taxes are not included in revenues  but rather are recorded as a liability until the taxes assessed are remitted to the respective taxing authorities 
in accordance with financial accounting standard board fasb and securities and exchange commission staff accounting sec accounting guidance on revenue recognition the company considers revenue earned and realizable when a persuasive evidence of the sales arrangement exists  b the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  c service delivery or performance has occurred  d customer acceptance has been received  if contractually required  and e collectability of the arrangement fee is probable 
the company typically uses signed contractual agreements as persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement 
we apply the provisions of the relevant fasb accounting pronouncements when making estimates or assumptions related to transactions involving the license of software where the software deliverables are considered more than inconsequential to the other elements in the arrangement 
for contracts that contain multiple deliverables  we analyze the revenue arrangements when making estimates or assumptions in accordance with the appropriate authoritative guidance  which provides criteria governing how to determine whether goods or services that are delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be considered as separate units of accounting for the purpose of revenue recognition 
deliverables are accounted for separately if they meet all of the following criteria a the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items  and c if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the company 
the company begins to recognize revenue from license fees for its asp products upon delivery and the customer s acceptance of the software implementation and customizations if necessary and applicable 
transaction services fee revenue for this use of our exchanges or asp platforms is recognized as the transactions occur and are generally billed in arrears 
service fees for hosting arrangements are recognized over the requisite service period 
revenue derived from the licensing of third party software products in connection with sales of the company s software licenses and is recognized upon delivery together with the company s licensed software products 
training  data conversion  installation  and consulting services fees are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
revenue for maintenance and support services is recognized ratably over the term of the support agreement 
revenues derived from initial setup or registration fees are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement in accordance with fasb and sec accounting guidance on revenue recognition 

table of contents deferred revenue includes maintenance and support payments or billings that have been received and recorded prior to performance and  in certain cases  cash collections  initial setup or registration fees under hosting agreements  software license fees received in advance of delivery  acceptance  and or completion of the earnings process  and amounts received under multi element arrangements in which objective evidence of the fair value for the undelivered elements does not exist 
in these instances revenue is recognized when the fair value of the undelivered elements is determinable or when all contractual elements have been completed and delivered 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  write offs  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating uncertainties and estimate as to the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable and the adequacy of the company s recorded allowance for doubtful accounts 
valuation of goodwill goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
the company applies the provisions of the fasb s accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets which addresses how goodwill and other acquired intangible assets should be accounted for in financial statements 
in this regard we test these intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment are present 
such potential impairment indicators include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  and the sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business 
the testing involves comparing the reporting unit and intangible asset carrying values to their respective fair values  we determine fair value by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows 
the cash flow projections are based on our views of growth rates  anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
the use of different estimates or assumptions for our projected discounted cash flows eg  growth rates  future economic conditions  discount rates and estimates of terminal values when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge 
during the twelve months ended december    and  we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances 
for additional information about goodwill  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb accounting guidance on the accounting and disclosure of income taxes  which involves estimating the company s current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the company has not recognized a deferred us tax liability and associated income tax expense for the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which we consider indefinitely invested because those foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested in those subsidiaries to fund ongoing operations and growth 
if those earnings were not considered indefinitely invested  the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability as of december  would have been approximately million 
the company follows the provisions of fasb accounting guidance on accounting for uncertain income tax positions 
this guidance clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
the guidance utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon final settlement 
table of contents foreign currency translation our reporting currency is the us dollar 
for most of our foreign subsidiaries  with the exception of india and singapore  the functional currency is the local currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates 
the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet dates 
income and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the period 
gains and losses resulting from translation adjustments are included as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses that are derived from transactions denominated in other than the subsidiary s functional currency is included in the determination of net income 
historically the functional currency for the company foreign subsidiaries in india and singapore had been the indian rupee and singapore dollar  respectively 
as a result of the company rapid growth  including its recent acquisition of planetsoft  and the expansion of its intellectual property research and development activities in its singapore subsidiary  and its product development activities and information technology enabled services for the insurance industry provided by its india subsidiary in support of ebix operating divisions across the world both of which are transacted in us dollars  management undertook a reconsideration of functional currency designations for these two foreign subsidiaries in india and singapore  and concluded that effective july  the functional currency for these entities should be changed to the us dollar 
management believes that the acquisition of planetsoft in combination with the other four business acquisitions completed during the current year and the cumulative effect of business acquisitions made over the last few years which in turn has necessitated the rapid growth of the company operations in india and singapore  were indicative of a significant change in the economic facts and circumstances that justified the reconsideration and ultimate change in the functional currency 
had the change in the functional currency designation for our india and singapore subsidiaries not been made  the company would have incurred and recognized approximately thousand of additional foreign currency exchange gains during the year ended december  furthermore  a portion of monetary assets and liabilities for these two foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in foreign currencies are re measured into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at each reporting date 
these corresponding re measurement gains and losses are included as a component of foreign currency exchange gains and losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and amounted to a thousand loss for the year ended december

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates risk is related to our foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies 
a majority of the company s operations are based in the us  furthermore the functional currencies in our india and singapore divisions is the us dollar  and accordingly  a large portion of our business transactions are denominated in us dollars  however  the company has operations in australia  new zealand  great britain  and brazil  where we conduct transactions in the local currencies of each of these locations 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in the value of those foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  revenues or financial condition 
during the years of and the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation account  which is a component of stockholders equity  was an unrealized loss of million  and million  respectively 
the company considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in our respective foreign currency exchange rates of could possibly be experienced in the near term future 
such an adverse change in currency exchange rates would have resulted in reduction to pre tax income of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates to its interest expense on outstanding debt obligations and to its interest income on existing cash balances 
as of december  the company had million of outstanding debt obligations which consisted of a million balance on our commercial banking revolving line of credit and a million secured term loan 
the company s revolving line of credit and term loan bears interest at the rate of libor  and stood at at december  the company is exposed to market risk in relation to this line of credit and secured term loan in regards to the potential increase to interest expense arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
this interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase in the libor rate 
such an adverse change in the libor rate would have resulted in a reduction to pre tax income of approximately thousand and thousand for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the company s average cash balances during were million and its existing cash balances as of december  was million 
the company is exposed to market risk in relation to these cash balances in regards to the potential loss of interest income arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
this interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates earned on deposited funds 
such an adverse change in these interest rates would have resulted in a reduction to pre tax income of approximately thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ending december  in connection with the acquisition of planetsoft effective june   ebix issued a put option to the planetsoft three shareholders 
the put option  which expires in june  is exercisable during the day period immediately following the year anniversary date of the business acquisition  which if exercised would enable them to sell the underlying  shares of ebix common stock they received as part of the purchase consideration  back to the company at a price of per share  which represents a discount off of the per share value established on the effective date of the closing of ebix acquisition of planetsoft 
in accordance with the relevant authoritative accounting literature a portion of the total purchase consideration was allocated to this put liability based on its initial fair value  which was determined to be million using a black scholes model  and that its fair value on december  had decreased by thousand to million 
the inputs used in the valuation of the put option include term  stock price volatility  current stock price  exercise price  and the risk free rate of return  with the volatility factor being the input subject to the most variation 
therefore  as pertaining to the put option  the company is exposed to market risk in regards to the rate and magnitude of change of our stock price and corresponding variations to the volatility factor used in the black scholes valuation model 
we evaluated this risk by estimating the potential adverse impact of a increase in the volatility factor and determined that such a change in the volatility factor would have resulted in an approximate thousand increase to the put option liability and a corresponding reduction to pre tax income for the year ending december
