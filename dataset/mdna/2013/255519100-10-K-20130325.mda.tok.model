item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview publicly reported information has reflected improvement in the united states housing sector and commercial construction in we believe our business  driven more by resale and remodeling of existing homes and commercial facilities  will be positively affected by this overall market improvement in the second half of was a year in which we experienced strong results early in the year  followed by a weak summer and finally the market returning to a stronger showing in the last quarter 
while our business was more deeply affected by the economic crisis as it reached the higher end markets where our business is concentrated  we believe our position in the upper end of the markets has permitted us to benefit from improved conditions and will allow us to take advantage of further anticipated growth in the upper end markets 
our residential sales growth rate for was slightly above that of the industry 
our sales included a one time special in our mass merchant sector that had the effect of generating sales volume in  albeit at lower margins 
our commercial business significantly underperformed the industry during and reflected a decline in our year over year commercial sales compared with  a period in which we had significant volume in lower margin sales to major national retailers and had sales growth that far exceeded the industry thereby negatively affecting our year over year comparisons in as well as versus the industry 
during  we embarked upon several strategic and tactical initiatives that we believe will permit us to strengthen our future and allow us to return to sustained growth and profitability  although certain of these actions negatively impacted our results 
these items  further discussed below  include investment in the development of certain new products  the acquisition of a continuous dyeing facility in north georgia  the acquisition of certain rug manufacturing equipment and related business  realignment of certain of our broadloom tufting technologies from atmore  alabama into our north georgia eton facility  an opportunistic purchase of certain products from an industry competitor to incorporate into our product line and changes in both manufacturing and commercial business management 
we have taken advantage of several opportunities to invest in products we believe will further differentiate us from the competition 
we have access to two new yarn systems that have been limited in distribution and  we believe  will provide exceptional softness and colorfastness qualities 
in addition  we have developed a new permaset process for wool which we believe will allow our designer customers the broadest possible choice of colorations 
as a result  during we invested at an increased rate in sampling initiatives related to these product offerings as compared to the same periods in the prior year 
during  we relocated certain of our tufting technologies from our manufacturing facility in atmore  alabama to our facility in eton  georgia to achieve a more favorable cost structure for the products and markets served from those technologies 
the tufting realignment was completed during this realignment resulted in incremental operating costs of approximately thousand during on november   we acquired a continuous carpet dyeing facility in calhoun  georgia 
the acquisition of this dyeing operation will allow us to transition certain of our products from our beck dyeing operation in atmore  alabama and from other third party commission continuous dyeing operations located in north georgia 
we believe this will allow us to achieve significant cost reductions in the dyeing process and support future growth 
the purchase price of this acquisition consisted of a million  seller financed note  a cash payment of thousand and thousand representing the fair value of a five year  below market agreement to process certain of the seller products on a commission basis during this period as we ramp up the dyeing of our products 
in conjunction with the acquisition of these assets  we are in the process of assessing all of our dyeing and ancillary assets throughout our company 
as the process evolves  some of these assets may be utilized elsewhere in our facilities and some may be taken out of service and could therefore result in non cash asset impairment charges or incremental costs associated with potential asset redeployments within our facilities 
on november   we acquired certain specialized wool rug tufting equipment and the associated business for total consideration valued at million  consisting of thousand of cash paid currently  thousand representing the fair value of cash to be paid in equal installments over a three year period and million representing the fair value of contingent consideration over a three year period 
we were the major consumer of products produced by the seller on the equipment 
this acquisition will also allow us to pursue business in another market the seller was developing 
the acquisition is expected to significantly reduce our cost by producing the goods in house and should allow us to further access and develop other markets and support what we believe to be good growth potential in markets we currently serve 
additionally  during  we made a change in our manufacturing management in connection with the realignment of the tufting equipment relocations and brought in new leadership for our commercial business in an effort to strengthen our performance in our commercial sector 
these actions resulted in incremental costs of approximately thousand in 
table of contents we remain optimistic about conditions that affect the higher end residential markets we serve and continue to address initiatives in our commercial offerings related to our products  manufacturing processes and distribution alternatives 
results of operations our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles

selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses reflected a reduction of percentage points as a percentage of sales in compared with the incremental improvement in the percentage comparison in these expenses was primarily a result of the cost reduction initiatives  organizational realignment  lower variable selling expenses associated with certain sales and greater absorption of the fixed component of these expenses as a result of the increased sales volume

we will continue to aggressively manage all elements of our business affecting cash including working capital and capital expenditures 
however  deterioration in our markets or significant additional cash expenditures above our normal liquidity requirements could require supplemental financing or other funding sources 
there can be no assurance that such supplemental financing or other sources of funding can be obtained or will be obtained on terms favorable to us 
cash sources and uses

trade receivables increased million commensurate with increased sales activity while taxes receivable decreased million 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million principally associated with the increase in inventories and certain accrued expenses associated with the increase in sales

capital expenditures in primarily related to facilities and existing equipment 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in  while depreciation and amortization are expected to be approximately million 
planned capital expenditures in are directed toward both new manufacturing equipment and certain of our continuous dyeing equipment 
revolving credit facility 
on september   we entered into a five year  secured revolving credit facility the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility provides for a maximum of million of revolving credit  subject to borrowing base availability  including limited amounts of credit in the form of letters of credit and swingline loans 
the borrowing base is equal to specified percentages of our eligible accounts receivable  inventories and fixed assets less reserves established  from time to time  by the administrative agent under the senior credit facility 
at our election  revolving loans under the senior credit facility bear interest at annual rates equal to either a libor for  or month periods  as we may select  plus an applicable margin of either or  or b the higher of the prime rate  the federal funds rate plus  or a daily libor rate  plus an applicable margin of either or 
the applicable margin is determined based on availability under the senior credit facility with margins increasing as availability decreases 
the weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under this agreement was at december  and at december  we also pay an unused line fee on the average amount by which the aggregate commitments exceed utilization of the senior credit facility equal to per annum

debt amendments 
on november   we amended our senior credit facility and mortgage note payable to modify certain definitions to effectively exclude up to million of costs in the fixed cost coverage ratio calculation as a result of our acquisition of a continuous carpet dyeing facility 
additionally  we subordinated the interests of our lender under our senior credit facility to the interests of the seller of the continuous dyeing assets to facilitate the seller financing of the transaction 
obligation to development authority of gordon county 
on november   we signed a seller financed note of million with lineage pcr  inc lineage related to the acquisition of the continuous carpet dyeing facility in calhoun  georgia 
effective december  through a series of agreements between us  the development authority of gordon county  georgia the authority and lineage  obligations with identical payment terms as the original note to lineage are now payment obligations to the authority 
these transactions were consummated in order to provide us with a tax abatement to the related real estate and equipment at this facility 
the tax abatement plan provides for abatement for certain components of the real and personal property taxes for up to ten years

as a result of the refinancing in  we paid million in financing costs that is being amortized over the term of the senior credit facility and the mortgage loan 
additionally in  we recognized thousand of refinancing expenses of 
table of contents which thousand related to the write off of previously deferred financing costs and thousand related to fees paid to rd parties in connection with the new senior credit facility and mortgage loan 
convertible subordinated debentures 
on october   we optionally redeemed all of the outstanding convertible subordinated debentures pursuant to the provisions of the indenture dated may  the debentures were originally set to mature on may  the redemption price of million represented of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the principal balance at october  was million 
the debentures were convertible by their holders into shares of our common stock at effective conversion price of per share 
no holders exercised their right to convert their debentures into shares of our common stock 
equipment notes payable 
our equipment financing notes have terms ranging from four to seven years  are secured by the specific equipment financed  bear interest ranging from to and are due in monthly installments of principal and interest ranging from thousand to thousand through february the notes do not contain financial covenants 
capital lease obligations 
our capitalized lease obligations have terms ranging from four to seven years  are secured by the specific equipment leased  bear interest ranging from to and are due in monthly installments of principal and interest ranging from thousand to thousand through october interest payments 
interest payments for continuing operations were million in  million in and million in stock based awards 
we recognize compensation expense related to share based stock awards based on the fair value of the equity instrument over the period of vesting for the individual stock awards that were granted 
at december   the total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested restricted stock awards was million with a weighted average vesting period of years and unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options was thousand with a weighted average vesting period of years 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  or december  income tax considerations 
during the first quarter of  we paid approximately million representing a settlement reached with the internal revenue service for an audit for the tax years of through the settlement is related to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets for financial reporting purposes and the tax basis of those assets  accordingly the settlement resulted in an increase in deferred taxes and had no significant impact on tax expense 
excluding the internal revenue service settlement paid in  we anticipate cash outlays for income taxes to be relatively equivalent to our provision for income taxes in and expect our cash outlay for taxes to exceed our tax provision in and the anticipated differences in and are associated with timing differences between the book basis and tax basis of long lived  depreciable assets 
such differences could be in the range of million in each of the periods  although there are many factors that could alter the actual experience 
at december   we are in a net deferred tax asset position of million 
we performed an analysis  including an evaluation of certain tax planning strategies available to us  related to the net deferred tax asset and believe  absent tax law changes  that the net tax asset is recoverable in future periods  including a thousand federal income tax credit carry forward and federal net operating loss carry forward 
approximately million of future taxable income would be required to realize the deferred tax asset 
during  we decreased our tax valuation reserve related to future benefits for state net operating loss carry forwards by thousand because the underlying tax assets decreased 
discontinued operations environmental contingencies 
we have reserves for environmental obligations established at five previously owned sites that were associated with our discontinued textile businesses 
each site has a corrective action plan cap with the applicable authoritative state regulatory body responsible for oversight for environmental compliance 
the cap for four of these sites involves natural attenuation degradation of the contaminants through naturally occurring events over periods estimated at to years and the cap on the remaining site involves a pump and treat remediation process  estimated to occur over a period of to years 
additionally  we have a reserve for an environmental liability on the property of a facility and related business that was sold in the cap has a specified remediation term estimated to be years subsequent to the total costs for remediation for all of these sites were thousand  thousand for normal ongoing remediation costs and thousand for remediation to specific initiatives in we expect normal remediation costs to approximate thousand annually 
we have a reserve of million for environmental liabilities at these sites as of december  the liability established represents our best estimate of loss and is the reasonable amount to which there is any meaningful degree of certainty given the periods of estimated remediation and the dollars applicable to such remediation for those periods 
the actual timeline to remediate  and thus  the ultimate cost to complete such remediation through these remediation efforts  may differ significantly from our estimates 
pre tax cost for environmental remediation obligations classified as discontinued operations were primarily a result of specific events requiring action and additional expense in each period 
fair value of financial instruments 
due to our limited use of fair value instruments related to either assets or liabilities  we do not consider such valuations to rise to the level of critical accounting estimates related to the portrayal of our financial 
table of contents statements 
within the overall utilization of fair value  only million of liabilities fall under a level classification those subject to significant management judgment or estimation 
these liabilities were estimated based on a third party valuations 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
this asu represents the converged guidance of the fasb and the international accounting standards board the boards on fair value measurement 
the collective efforts of the boards and their staffs have resulted in common requirements  including a consistent meaning of the term fair value 
the boards have concluded the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and ifrs 
the asu was effective during the first quarter of and its adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity and requires the presentation of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
this asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and should be applied retrospectively 
we early adopted this asu in the prior year and presented the components of other comprehensive income in a separate statement following the statement of operations 
in december  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu deferred the changes in asu that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments to other comprehensive income 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu requires us to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  we are required to present significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  as the new standard does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements  we do not expect that the adoption of this asu will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the amendments in this asu require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
an entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 balance sheet topic clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the asu clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and receivables are not in the scope of asu no 
asu no 
applies only to derivatives  repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific criteria contained in the codification or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
the effective date is the same as the effective date of asu we do not expect that the adoption of these asus will have a a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this asu states that an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with codification subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other  general intangibles other than goodwill 
under the guidance in this asu  an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments in this asu are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim impairment tests performed as of a date before july   if a public entity financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or  for nonpublic entities  have not yet been made available for issuance 
we do not expect that the adoption of this asu will have a a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
certain related party transactions 
during the fiscal year ended december   we purchased a portion of our requirements for polyester fiber from engineered floors  an entity controlled by robert e 
shaw 
mr 
shaw reported holding approximately of our common stock  which as of year end represented approximately of the total vote of all classes of our common stock 
engineered floors is one of our suppliers of fiber  but is our principal supplier of polyester fiber 
our total 
table of contents purchases from engineered floors for were approximately million  or approximately of all our comparable external yarn purchases in our purchases from engineered floors are based on market value  negotiated prices 
we have no contractual arrangements or commitments with mr 
shaw associated with our business relationship with engineered floors 
transactions with engineered floors were reviewed and approved by our board of directors as arms length and on terms no less favorable to us than similar purchases form other fiber suppliers 
critical accounting policies certain estimates and assumptions are made when preparing our financial statements 
estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from estimates made when our financial statements are prepared 
the securities and exchange commission requires management to identify its most critical accounting policies  defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and the application of which requires our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
although our estimates have not differed materially from our experience  such estimates pertain to inherently uncertain matters that could result in material differences in subsequent periods 
we believe application of the following accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates and represent our critical accounting policies 
other significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues  including shipping and handling amounts  are recognized when the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that a sales agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer takes title to products  which is generally on the date of shipment 
at the time revenue is recognized  we record a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and any known trends or conditions 
accounts receivable allowances 
we provide allowances for expected cash discounts and doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and periodic evaluations of the financial condition of our customers 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to significantly deteriorate  or other factors impair their ability to pay their debts  credit losses could differ from allowances recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
customer claims and product warranties 
we provide product warranties related to manufacturing defects and specific performance standards for our products 
we record reserves for the estimated costs of defective products and failure to meet applicable performance standards 
the levels of reserves are established based primarily upon historical experience and our evaluation of pending claims 
because our evaluations are based on historical experience and conditions at the time our financial statements are prepared  actual results could differ from the reserves in our consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo  which generally matches current costs of inventory sold with current revenues  for substantially all inventories 
reserves are also established to adjust inventories that are off quality  aged or obsolete to their estimated net realizable value 
additionally  rates of recoverability per unit of off quality  aged or obsolete inventory are estimated based on historical rates of recoverability and other known conditions or circumstances that may affect future recoverability 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value our inventory 
self insured accruals 
we estimate costs required to settle claims related to our self insured medical  dental and workers compensation plans 
these estimates include costs to settle known claims  as well as incurred and unreported claims 
the estimated costs of known and unreported claims are based on historical experience 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to estimate these accruals 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory income tax rates that are expected to be applicable in future periods when temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of changes in income tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that a change in income tax rates is enacted 
taxing jurisdictions could disagree with our tax treatment of various items in a manner that could affect the tax treatment of such items in the future 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using existing laws  rules and regulations  each of which is subject to change 
loss contingencies 
we routinely assess our exposure related to legal matters  environmental matters  product liabilities or any other claims against our assets that may arise in the normal course of business 
if we determine that it is probable a loss has been incurred  the amount of the loss  or an amount within the range of loss  that can be reasonably estimated will be recorded 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands our earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to interest rates  among other factors 
it is our policy to minimize our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates and manage interest rate risks inherent in funding our company with debt 
we address this financial exposure through a risk management program that includes maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and the use of interest rate swap agreements see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december    or approximately of our total debt  was subject to floating interest rates 
a fluctuation in the variable interest rates applicable to this floating rate debt would have an annual after tax impact of approximately
