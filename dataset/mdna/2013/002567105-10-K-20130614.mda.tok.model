financial results 
in fiscal  we achieved total revenues of million  an increase of over fiscal the growth included increases in both revenues from instrument sales  which were million  an increase of  when compared to the prior year  and revenues from consumable sales  which were million  an increase of  when compared to the prior year 
gross profit in fiscal was million  an increase of over the prior year  primarily attributable to changes in the product mix in our veterinary market 
sales and marketing expenses were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increased costs related to headcount and promotional and marketing spending to support the ongoing growth of our veterinary business in north america 
general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  a decrease of  or  from fiscal to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a higher legal expenses incurred during fiscal related to pursuing a patent infringement case  which we resolved in september and b start up costs to develop avrl during the first six months of fiscal  partially offset by c an increase in personnel related costs related to share based compensation 
net income for fiscal was million  a increase from million in fiscal  due primarily to the increases in instrument and consumable sales and gain from our legal settlement with cepheid of million  offset in part by an increased income tax provision of million resulting from such settlement and the increased expenses set forth above 
our diluted earnings per share increased to in fiscal from in fiscal cash  cash equivalents and investments increased by million in fiscal to a total of million at march  the primary source of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal was operating cash flows of million

avrl 
during fiscal  we began developing avrl  a full service laboratory testing facility  based in olathe  kansas 
in october  we began providing veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services for veterinarians in the united states through avrl 
avrl also focuses on providing specialty and esoteric testing and analysis 
this service complements our full suite of on site laboratory instrumentation and rapid diagnostics for in hospital routine  critical care and emergency medicine laboratory needs 
factors that may impact future performance our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
our sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty  and may depend on a number of factors outside of our control  including but not limited to inventory or timing considerations by our distributors and transitioning the majority of our medical sales to abbott  as discussed above 
we generally operate with a limited order backlog because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received 
product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
as a result  any such revenues shortfall would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our sales may be adversely impacted by pricing pressure from competitors 
our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase the sales volumes of our piccolo and vetscan products and to achieve profitability in avrl and to successfully compete with other competitors 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful indicators of future results 

table of contents critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and the sensitivity of these estimates to deviations in the assumptions used in making them 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical because they are not only important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
our primary customers are distributors and direct customers in both the medical and veterinary markets 
service revenues are primarily generated from veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services for veterinarians 
revenues from product sales and services  net of estimated sales allowances  discounts and rebates  are recognized when i evidence of an arrangement exists  ii upon shipment of the products or rendering of services to the customer  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
rights of return are not provided 
from time to time  we offer discounts on avrl services for a specified period as incentives 
discounts are reductions to invoiced amounts within a specified period and are recorded at the time services are performed 
net service revenues are recognized at the time services are performed 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or non current deferred revenue liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contract 
multiple element revenue arrangements 
our sales arrangements may contain multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of instruments  consumables or extended maintenance agreements 
additionally  we provide incentives in the form of free goods or extended maintenance agreements to customers in connection with the sale of our instruments 
starting in fiscal  we participate in selling arrangements in the veterinary market that include multiple deliverables  such as instruments  consumables and service agreements associated with our veterinary reference laboratory 
judgments as to the allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement  and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements 
a multiple element arrangement includes the sale of one or more tangible product offerings with one or more associated services offerings  each of which are individually considered separate units of accounting 
we allocate revenues to each element in a multiple element arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or third party evidence tpe of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use our best estimate of selling price for that deliverable 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
revenues from our multiple element arrangements are allocated separately to the instruments  consumables  extended maintenance agreements and incentives based on the relative selling price method 
amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value  such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately 
revenues allocated to each element are then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria  as described above  are met for each element 
revenues associated with incentives in the form of free goods are deferred until the goods are shipped to the customer 
revenues associated with incentives in the form of extended maintenance agreements are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the extended maintenance contract  generally one to three years 
incentives in the form of extended maintenance agreements are our most significant multiple element arrangement 
for our selling arrangements in the veterinary market that include multiple deliverables  such as instruments  consumables and service agreements associated with our veterinary reference laboratory  revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product or performance of the service during the term of the service contract when the basic revenue recognition criteria  as described above  are met for each element 
we allocate revenues to each element based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value  such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately 

table of contents from time to time  we offer customer incentives comprising of arrangements with customers to include discounts on future sales of services associated with our veterinary reference laboratory 
we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental 
when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental  we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement 
to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental  we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product to similar customers  the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement  and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement 
if the discount in the multiple element arrangement approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales  that discount is not considered incremental 
during fiscal and  our customer incentive programs with future discounts were not significant 
at march  and  the current portion of deferred revenue balances was million and million  respectively  and the non current portion of deferred revenue balances was million and million  respectively 
the total increase in deferred revenue balances as of march  is primarily due to an increase in maintenance contracts offered to customers from time to time in the form of free services in connection with the sale of our products  partially offset by deferred revenue recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract 
customer programs 
from time to time  we offer customer marketing and incentive programs 
our most significant customer programs are described as follows instrument trade in programs 
we periodically offer trade in programs to customers for trading in an existing instrument to purchase a new instrument and we will either provide incentives in the form of free goods or reduce the sales price of the instrument 
these incentives in the form of free goods are recorded based on the relative selling price method according to the policies described above 
instrument rental programs 
we periodically offer programs to customers whereby certain instruments are made available to customers for rent or on an evaluation basis 
these programs typically require customers to purchase a minimum quantity of consumables during a specified period for which we recognize revenues on the related consumables according to the policies described above 
depending on the program offered  customers may purchase the instrument during the rental or evaluation period 
proceeds from such sale are recorded as revenues according to the policies described above 
rental income  if any  are also recorded as revenue according to the policies described above 
distributor and customer rebate programs 
we periodically offer distributor pricing rebates and customer incentives  such as cash rebates  from time to time 
the distributor pricing rebates are offered to distributors upon meeting the sales volume requirements during a qualifying period and are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues during a qualifying period 
cash rebates are offered to distributors or customers who purchase certain products or instruments during a promotional period and are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues 
the distributor pricing rebate program is offered to distributors in the north america veterinary market  upon meeting the sales volume requirements of veterinary products during the qualifying period 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of products sold subject to a rebate during the qualifying period and which rebate percentage applies 
based on these factors and using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid and record the liability as a reduction to gross revenues when we record the sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from one to nine months after sale 
changes in the rebate accrual at each fiscal year end are based upon distributors meeting the purchase requirements during the quarter 
other rebate programs offered to distributors or customers vary from period to period in the medical and veterinary markets 
the following table summarizes the change in total accrued distributor and customer rebates in thousands balance at beginning balance at of year provisions payments end of year year ended march  year ended march  year ended march  royalty revenues 
royalties are typically based on licensees net sales of products that utilize our technology and are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured  such as upon the receipt of a royalty statement from the licensee 
our royalty revenue depends on the licensees use of our technology  and therefore  may vary from period to period and impact our revenues during a quarter 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of the amounts owed to us by our customers 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers which is mostly determined by the customer s payment history and the outstanding period of accounts 
we specifically identify amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted accordingly 
an additional allowance is recorded based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  using historical experience to estimate the potential uncollectible and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating income 
fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining fair value  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels  which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
as of march   our investments in cash equivalents  which we classified as available for sale  totaled million  using level inputs since these investments are traded in an active market 
the valuations are based on quoted prices of the underlying security that are readily and regularly available in an active market  and accordingly  a significant degree of judgment is not required 
level directly or indirectly observable inputs as of the reporting date through correlation with market data  including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active 
level also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models  such as interest rates and volatility factors  are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
as of march   our available for sale investments in certificates of deposits  corporate bonds and municipal bonds  totaled million  using level inputs  based on market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities obtained from various third party data providers 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data and require the use of significant management judgment 
these values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions 
as of march   we did not have any level financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are developed to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
at march   we also had million in investments classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost 
investment in unconsolidated affiliate 
in february  we purchased a equity ownership interest in smb  for million in cash 
we use the equity method to account for our investment in this entity that we do not control  but where we have the ability to exercise significant influence 
equity method investments are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize our proportionate share of the investees net income or losses after the date of investment  additional contributions made and dividends or distributions received  and impairment losses resulting from adjustments to net realizable value 
we eliminate all intercompany transactions in accounting for our equity method investments 
we record our proportionate share of the investees net income or losses in interest and other income expense  net on the consolidated statements of income 
at march  and  our investment in unconsolidated affiliate totaled million 
we assess the potential impairment of our equity method investments when indicators such as a history of operating losses  a negative earnings and cash flow outlook  and the financial condition and prospects for the investee s business segment might indicate a loss in value 
we did not recognize any impairment loss on investment in unconsolidated affiliate during fiscal  and warranty reserves 
we provide for the estimated future costs to be incurred under our standard warranty obligation on our instruments 
our standard warranty obligation on instruments ranges from one to three years  depending on the type of product 
the estimated contractual warranty obligation is recorded when the related revenues are recognized and any additional amount is recorded when such cost is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
cost of revenues reflects estimated warranty expense for instruments sold in the current period and any adjustments in estimated warranty expense for the installed base under our standard warranty obligation based on our quarterly evaluation of service experience 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our estimated accrual for warranty exposure is based on our historical experience as to product failures  estimated product failure rates  estimated repair costs  material usage and freight incurred in repairing the instrument after failure and known design changes under the warranty plan 

table of contents a provision for defective reagent discs is recorded when the related sale is recognized and any additional amount is recorded when such cost is probable and can be reasonably estimated  at which time they are included in cost of revenues 
the warranty cost includes the replacement costs and freight of a defective reagent disc 
as of march   our current portion of warranty reserves for instruments and reagent discs totaled  and our non current portion of warranty reserves for instruments totaled  which reflects our estimate of warranty obligations based on the estimated product failure rates  the number of instruments in standard warranty  estimated repair and related costs of instruments  and an estimate of defective reagent discs and replacement and related costs of a defective reagent disc 
each quarter  we reevaluate our estimate of warranty reserves  including our assumptions 
during fiscal  we recorded an adjustment to pre existing warranties of  which reduced our warranty reserves and our cost of revenues  based on both historical and projected product performance rates of instruments 
for fiscal  and  the provision for warranty expense related to instruments was  million and  respectively 
the provision related to instruments decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily attributable to our quarterly evaluation of service experience on our chemistry analyzers based on estimated product failure rates 
the increase in the provision related to instruments during fiscal was primarily attributed to a change in our standard warranty period and an increase in the number of instruments under standard warranty 
management periodically evaluates the sufficiency of the warranty provisions and makes adjustments when necessary 
if an unusual performance rate related to warranty claims is noted  an additional warranty accrual may be assessed and recorded when a failure event is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we review the historical warranty cost trends and analyze the adequacy of the ending accrual balance of warranty reserves each quarter 
the determination of warranty reserves requires us to make estimates of the estimated product failure rate  expected costs to repair or replace the instruments and to replace defective reagent discs under warranty 
if actual repair or replacement costs of instruments or replacement costs of reagent discs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to cost of revenues may be required 
additionally  if factors change and we revise our assumptions on the product failure rate of instruments or reagent discs  then our warranty reserves and cost of revenues could be materially impacted in the quarter of such revision  as well as in following quarters 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using standard costs which approximate actual costs using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories include material  labor and overhead 
we establish provisions for excess  obsolete and unusable inventories after evaluation of future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management or if a significant amount of the material were to become unusable  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our operating income 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  such as property and equipment and amortized intangible assets  whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long lived assets indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable or their useful lives are no longer appropriate 
we look to current and future profitability  as well as current and future undiscounted cash flows  excluding financing costs  as primary indicators of recoverability 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal is less than the carrying amount 
if impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value and long lived assets are written down to their respective fair values 
we did not recognize any impairment charges on long lived assets during fiscal  and intangible assets 
intangible assets  consisting of purchased patents  licenses and other rights acquired from third parties  are presented at cost  net of accumulated amortization 
the intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life  which approximates the economic benefit 
if our underlying assumptions regarding the estimated useful life of an intangible asset change  then the amortization period  would be adjusted accordingly  and could result in a material change in the amortization expense and the carrying value for such asset 
during fiscal  and  our changes in estimated useful life of intangible assets were not significant 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be recovered 

table of contents we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
at march  and  we had no significant uncertain tax positions 
our policy is to include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes 
for fiscal  and  we did not recognize any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the consolidated statements of income  and at march  and  we had no accrued interest or penalties 
share based compensation expense 
we account for share based compensation arrangements using the fair value method 
we recognize share based compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the requisite service period of the award to employees and directors 
as required by fair value provisions of share based compensation  employee share based compensation expense recognized is calculated over the requisite service period of the awards and reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical data of our share based compensation awards that are granted and cancelled prior to vesting and upon historical experience of employee turnover 
changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant  unanticipated increases or decreases in share based compensation expense from period to period 
to the extent we revise our estimate of the forfeiture rate in the future  our share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
we have not granted any stock options since the beginning of fiscal and we did not grant stock options during fiscal  or we have recognized compensation expense during the requisite service period of the stock option 
as of march   we had no unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options granted 
since fiscal  we grant restricted stock unit awards to employees  consultants and directors as part of our share based compensation program 
equity award grants to consultants were insignificant 
awards of restricted stock units may be either grants of time based or performance based restricted stock units that are issued at no cost to the recipient  as described below 
the fair value of restricted stock unit awards time vesting used in our expense recognition method is measured based on the number of shares granted and the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
share based compensation expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the requisite service period of the award 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
we also began granting restricted stock unit awards subject to performance vesting criteria  which we refer to as restricted stock unit awards performance vesting  to our executive officers in fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the compensation committee of our board of directors the compensation committee approved the grant of restricted stock unit awards performance vesting for  shares of common stock to our executive officers the fy performance rsus 
the fy performance rsus were subject to vesting in four equal annual increments based upon achievement of certain pre established corporate annual performance related goals  as established by the compensation committee  and the grantee s satisfying service requirements through the vesting period 
the fiscal performance target was established at the grant date following asc and the aggregate estimated grant date fair value of the fy performance rsus was  or per share  based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the number of vested restricted stock unit awards performance vesting is determined at the end of each annual performance period 
because each annual performance target was to be set at the start of each respective single fiscal year performance period  and only the target for fiscal performance was set as of march   only of the fy performance rsus were deemed granted in fiscal in accordance with asc  and the remaining of the fy performance rsus were not deemed granted for accounting purposes as of march  during the first quarter of fiscal  our compensation committee granted restricted stock unit awards performance vesting to acquire shares of the company s common stock to our executive officers the fy performance rsus 
the fy performance rsus vest only if both of the following criteria are satisfied our consolidated income from operations for the fiscal year ending march   as certified by the compensation committee  is in excess of the applicable target amount set forth in the table below  and the recipient remains in the service of the company as defined in our equity incentive plan until the applicable vesting date set forth below shares issuable upon settlement of fy performance rsus consolidated income from operations for the year ending march  vesting date of target april  of target april  of target april  of target april  
table of contents on april    shares subject to the fy performance rsus were issued as a result of exceeding of our consolidated income from operations target for the fiscal year ending march  in consideration of the grant of the fy performance rsus described above  the remaining fy performance rsus were cancelled and are no longer outstanding 
share based compensation expense has had a material impact on our earnings per share and on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal  and the impact of share based compensation expense on our consolidated financial results is disclosed in note  equity compensation plans and share based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
as of march   our unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards granted to employees and directors to date totaled million  which expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average service period of years 
we expect that share based compensation will materially impact our consolidated financial statements in the foreseeable future 
excluding forfeitures  we estimate expense recognition of restricted stock units over the requisite service period of the award  for awards granted and unvested as of march  as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal results of operations total revenues revenues by geographic region and by product and service category 
revenues by geographic region based on customer location and revenues by product and service category during fiscal  and were as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended march  change to change to revenues by increase percent increase percent geographic region decrease change decrease change north america percentage of total revenues europe percentage of total revenues asia pacific and rest of the world percentage of total revenues total revenues year ended march  change to change to revenues by product increase percent increase percent and service category decrease change decrease change instruments percentage of total revenues consumables percentage of total revenues other products and services percentage of total revenues product and service revenues  net percentage of total revenues development and licensing revenues percentage of total revenues total revenues instruments include chemistry analyzers  hematology instruments  vspro specialty analyzers and i stat analyzers

fiscal compared to fiscal north america 
during fiscal  total revenues in north america increased by  or million  as compared to fiscal the change in total revenues in north america was primarily attributable to the following total revenues from our piccolo chemistry analyzers and medical reagent discs in north america excluding sales to the us government decreased by  or  primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices of piccolo chemistry analyzers and medical reagent discs sold to our distributor  abbott point of care inc abbott  partially offset by an increase in the sales volume of piccolo chemistry to abbott 
in october  we entered into the abbott agreement 
total sales of our piccolo chemistry analyzers and medical reagent discs to the us government decreased by  or million  primarily due to a decrease in the us military s needs for our products as a result of us troops leaving iraq in 
table of contents total revenues from our vetscan chemistry analyzers and veterinary reagent discs in north america increased by  or million  primarily due to a an increase in the sales volume of vetscan chemistry analyzers due in part to additional sales personnel and sales to various distributors  including mwi veterinary supply  inc mwi since we entered into a distribution agreement in september  b an increase in the sales volume of veterinary reagent discs resulting from an expanded installed base of our vetscan chemistry analyzers and c higher average selling prices of vetscan chemistry analyzers and veterinary reagent discs 
total revenues from our vetscan hematology instruments and hematology reagent kits in north america increased by  or million  primarily due to an increase in the sales volume of vetscan hematology instruments due in part to additional sales personnel and sales to various distributors  including mwi 
total revenues from our vetscan vspro specialty analyzers and related consumables  vetscan i stat analyzers and related consumables and vetscan rapid tests in north america increased by  or million  primarily due to an increase in the sales volume of vetscan vspro specialty analyzers  vetscan i stat analyzers and vetscan rapid tests  due in part to additional sales personnel and sales to various distributors  including mwi
