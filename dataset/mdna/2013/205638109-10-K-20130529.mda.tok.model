gaap to non gaap reconciliation in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company results as determined by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company has provided the following non gaap information a non gaap professional services margin  b non gaap operating income  c non gaap net income and d non gaap diluted earnings per share 
each of these financial measures excludes the impact of certain items and  therefore  has not been calculated in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures exclude a goodwill impairment charge  restructuring charges  advisory fees associated with certain shareholder actions  and the related tax impacts of these items 
each of the non gaap adjustments is described in more detail below 
the table below provides a reconciliation of each of these non gaap measures to its most comparable gaap financial measure 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because they exclude amounts that management and the board of directors do not consider part of core operating results when assessing the performance of the organization 
we believe that inclusion of these non gaap financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports of financial results 
accordingly  we believe these non gaap financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency of supplemental information used by management 

table of contents while we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information  there are limitations associated with the use of these non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap  are not audited  and do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies 
items such as a goodwill impairment charge  restructuring charges  advisory fees associated with certain shareholder actions  and the related tax impacts of these items that are excluded from our non gaap financial measures can have a material impact on net income 
as a result  these non gaap financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  net income or loss  cash flow from operations or other measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
we compensate for these limitations by using these non gaap financial measures as supplements to gaap financial measures and by reconciling the non gaap financial measures to their most comparable gaap financial measure 
we have procedures in place to ensure that these measures are calculated using the appropriate gaap components in their entirety and to ensure that our performance is properly reflected to facilitate consistent period to period comparisons 
the following discusses the reconciling items from our non gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap financial measures goodwill impairment charge 
our non gaap financial measures exclude an impairment charge associated with a decline in the estimated fair value of our professional services business unit 
management and the board of directors believe it is useful in evaluating corporate performance during a particular time period to review the supplemental non gaap financial measures  excluding goodwill impairment to provide comparability and consistency with historical operating results 
restructuring charges 
our non gaap financial measures exclude restructuring charges  and any subsequent changes in estimates  as they relate to our corporate restructuring and exit activities  including asset impairments resulting from a fourth quarter fiscal operational review 
management and the board of directors believe it is useful in evaluating corporate performance during a particular time period to review the supplemental non gaap financial measures  excluding restructuring charges  in order to provide comparability and consistency with historical operating results 
advisory fees associated with certain shareholder actions 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company received an unsolicited  nonbinding offer to purchase the outstanding shares of the company from a shareholder 
the company has incurred costs of approximately million for unplanned consultant fees to review the offer  analyze the business and review additional requests for information from other interested parties 
management and the board of directors believe it is useful in evaluating corporate performance during a particular time period to review the supplemental non gaap financial measures  excluding such costs  in order to provide comparability and consistency with historical operating results 
provision for income taxes on above pre tax non gaap adjustments 
our non gaap financial measures exclude the tax impact of the above pre tax non gaap adjustments 
this amount is calculated using the tax rates of each country to which these pre tax non gaap adjustments relate 
management excludes the non gaap adjustments on a net of tax basis in evaluating our performance 
therefore  we exclude the tax impact of these charges when presenting non gaap financial measures

although we continue to experience high maintenance renewal rates with our current mainframe customers  new or growth customers are not entirely replacing the maintenance revenue loss from the non renewed or reduced capacity mainframe maintenance arrangements

cost of professional services is presented in the table below in thousands period to period change year ended march  to to cost of professional services percentage of professional services fees cost of professional services decreased million during and increased million during the decrease during was primarily a result of the decline in revenue which reduced our use of subcontractors in our professional services segment and a decline in compensation and benefits expense due to headcount reductions also made as a result of the decline in revenue see professional services discussion above for additional information 
these declines were partially offset by a bad debt reserve recorded for one of our municipal customers 
the increase during was primarily due to higher compensation  employee benefit and travel costs related to the hiring of billable staff and additional subcontractor costs to support the activity in our professional services segment 
the increase in cost as a percentage of professional services fees for was largely due to the decline in professional services fees primarily related to a reduction in application development services for customers within the financial services industry 
many of the costs associated with our professional services fees  specifically salary and benefits expenses  do not fluctuate with changes in revenue

administrative and general expenses are presented in the table below in thousands period to period change year ended march  to to administrative and general expenses administrative and general costs decreased  during due primarily to a decline in bonus expense resulting from lower company wide bonus attainment 
the decline was partially offset by increased salary and benefits expense related to a post retirement consulting agreement executed during  asset impairment charges and advisory fees related to certain shareholder activities 
administrative and general costs increased million during due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expense and increased bonus expense related to higher company wide bonus attainment 
these cost increases were partially offset by a reduction in operating tax expense 
restructuring charge as part of our announced plan to increase shareholder value  we are implementing significant cost reduction actions with the intention to eliminate approximately million to million of administrative and general and non core operational costs over the next two years 
in february  we approved the initial phase of a restructuring plan designed to achieve a portion of these savings  which involves reductions in our global workforce of approximately employees less than of our total workforce  including employees across all operating and administrative divisions  the early abandonment of certain operating leases and the closing or reduction in size of office facilities worldwide 
the company recorded a charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of for the costs associated with these reductions 
of the total amount  approximately million was related to severance costs for terminated employees  million was related to lease abandonment costs and million was related to other restructuring charges  primarily asset write downs 
the company anticipates that approximately million in additional employee termination charges and million in lease abandonment costs will be taken during fiscal for the initial phase of the restructuring plan  and it is expected that the activities in the initial phase will be completed before december 
table of contents there were no restructuring actions taken during or see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more details regarding our restructuring plan 
other income expense other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income realized from our cash and cash equivalents  interest earned on our financing receivables  our share of the income or loss from our investments in partially owned companies and interest expense primarily associated with our long term debt 
other income expense is presented in the table below in thousands period to period change year ended march  to to interest income interest expense other other income expense the decline in interest income for is primarily due to the reduction in cash and cash equivalents resulting from cash used to purchase dynatrace in  repayments on our outstanding debt  our share repurchases and  to a lesser extent  a decline in interest income related to our installment receivables 
the decrease in interest expense for is related to interest on borrowings under the line of credit 
borrowings were incurred primarily to fund a portion of the dynatrace acquisition during the second quarter of and to continue the share repurchase program 
the average outstanding debt balance during was approximately million as compared to approximately million during the decline in other for is primarily related to a million loss recognized on our investments in start up companies see note of the of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information 
other income expense declined million during the decline in interest income was primarily due to the decline in cash and cash equivalents related to cash paid for the dynatrace acquisition and to a lesser extent a decline in interest income related to our installment receivables 
the increase in interest expense is related to interest on borrowings under the line of credit 
borrowings were incurred primarily to fund a portion of the dynatrace acquisition during income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and net operating loss and credit carryforwards 

table of contents the income tax provision and effective tax rate are presented in the table below in thousands period to period change year ended march  to to income tax provision effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate was  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted primarily by the minimal income before income tax provision base of approximately million  coupled with the non deductibility of the majority of the goodwill impairment charge 
see note for information regarding the impairment evaluation on goodwill and other intangible assets at march the effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted primarily by the following favorable items new legislation was enacted that amended michigan s income tax act to implement a comprehensive set of tax changes 
one part of the legislation contains provisions that replaced the michigan business tax mbt with a new corporate income tax 
certain credits allowed under the mbt  including the brownfield redevelopment tax credit  will continue to be effective  which allowed us to reduce our future tax liability for the duration of the carryforward period 
therefore  the valuation allowance associated with this deferred tax asset was reversed in fiscal all remaining issues related to the fiscal through fiscal tax periods were effectively settled with the internal revenue service 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the difference between our effective tax rate and the statutory rate for fiscal  and management s discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
assumptions and estimates were based on facts and circumstances existing at march  however  future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from licensing software products  providing maintenance and support services for those products  permitting customers to access our hosted software delivered on a saas basis  and rendering professional and application services 
our software solutions are comprised of license fees  maintenance fees  subscription fees and software related professional services fees 
we sometimes enter into arrangements that include both software related deliverables licensed software products  maintenance services or software related professional services and non software deliverables hosted software  professional services unrelated to our software products or application services 
our hosted software and application services do not qualify as software deliverables because our license grant does not allow the customer the right or capability to take possession of the software 
for arrangements that contain both software and non software deliverables  in accordance with asc revenue recognition  we allocate the arrangement consideration to the non software deliverables as a group  and to the software deliverables as a group the deliverable groups 
we determine the selling price to allocate the arrangement consideration to the deliverable groups based on the following hierarchy of evidence vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe  meaning price when sold separately if available  third party evidence of selling price if vsoe is not available  or best estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
we currently are unable to establish vsoe or third party evidence of selling price for either our software related deliverables or our non software deliverables as a group 
therefore  the best estimate of selling price for each deliverable group is determined primarily by considering various factors  including  but not limited to stated renewal rates in a contract  if any  the historical selling price of these deliverables in similar stand alone transactions and pricing practices 
total arrangement consideration is then allocated on the basis of the deliverable group s relative selling price 

table of contents once we have allocated the arrangement consideration between the deliverable groups  we recognize revenue as described below in the respective product revenue recognition  subscription fees and professional and application services fees sections 
in order for a transaction to be eligible for revenue recognition  the following revenue criteria must be met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we evaluate collectability based on past customer history  external credit ratings and payment terms within various customer agreements 
product revenue recognition we license software products using both perpetual and term time based licenses and provide maintenance services and software related professional services 
our software related professional services do not require significant production  modification or customization of the licensed software product 
assuming all revenue recognition criteria are met  perpetual license fee revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which the fair value  based on vsoe  of all undelivered elements of the agreement ie  maintenance and software related professional services is deferred 
vsoe is based on rates charged for maintenance and professional services when sold separately 
the remaining portion of the fee is recognized as license fee revenue upon delivery of the products 
based on market conditions  we periodically change pricing methodologies for license  maintenance and software related services 
changes in rates charged for stand alone maintenance and software related services could have an impact on how bundled revenue agreements are characterized as license  maintenance or software related services or have an effect on the timing of revenue recognition in the future 
pricing modifications  if any  made during the years covered by this report have not had a significant impact on the timing or characterization of revenue recognized 
for revenue arrangements where there is a lack of vsoe for any undelivered elements  license fee revenue is deferred and recognized upon delivery of those elements or when vsoe can be established 
however  when maintenance or software related professional services are the only undelivered elements  the license fee revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of the maintenance term or the period the software related professional services are expected to be performed 
such transactions include time based licenses and certain unlimited capacity licenses  as we have not established vsoe for the undelivered elements in these arrangements 
in order to comply with sec regulation s x  rule b  which requires product  services and other categories of revenue to be displayed separately on the income statement  we separate the license fee  maintenance fee and software related professional services fee which is included in professional services fees associated with these types of arrangements based on its determination of fair value 
we apply vsoe for maintenance related to perpetual license transactions and standalone software related professional services arrangements as a reasonable and consistent approximation of fair value to separate license fee  maintenance fee and software related professional services fee revenue for income statement classification purposes 

table of contents we allow customers to have installment payment terms in our arrangements and generally  revenues from these transactions are recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
this is because we have an established business practice of offering installment payment terms to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
however  because a significant portion of our license fee revenue is earned in connection with installment sales  changes in our customer collection experience  future economic conditions or technological developments could adversely affect our ability to immediately record license fees for these types of transactions and or limit our ability to collect these receivables 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term 
the maintenance revenue associated with all sales is deferred and is recognized over the applicable maintenance period 
subscription fees our subscription fees relate to arrangements that permit our customers to access and utilize our hosted software and are delivered on a saas basis 
the subscription arrangements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time  nor do the arrangements contain rights of return 
subscription fees are deferred upon contract execution and are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
professional services fees our professional services fees are generally based on hourly or daily rates 
revenues from professional services are recognized in the period the services are performed provided that collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
for development services rendered under fixed price contracts  revenues are recognized using the proportional performance method and if it is determined that costs will exceed revenue  the expected loss is recorded at the time the loss becomes apparent 
application services fees our application services fees consist of revenue related to our covisint on demand software including associated services 
the arrangements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time  nor do the arrangements contain rights of return 
many of our application services fee contracts include a services project fee and a recurring fee for ongoing platform as a service paas operations 
certain services related to these projects have stand alone value eg  other vendors provide similar services and qualify as a separate unit of accounting 
services that have stand alone value are recognized as delivered 
for those services that do not have stand alone value  the revenue is deferred and recognized over the longer of the committed term of the subscription agreement generally one to five years or the expected period over which the customer will receive benefit generally five years 
the recurring fees are recognized ratably over the applicable service period 
unforeseen events that result in additional time or costs being required to complete fixed price projects associated with either professional services or application services could affect the timing of revenue recognition for the balance of the project as well as margins going forward  and could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
capitalized software we follow the guidance of asc costs of software to be sold  leased  or marketed when capitalizing development costs associated with our software products and asc internal use software when capitalizing development costs associated with our hosted software and application services 
the cost of purchased and internally developed software technology is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value 
we compute annual amortization using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software technology which is generally three to five years 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and future revenue estimates supporting the capitalized software cost can be negatively affected based upon competitive products  services and pricing 
such adverse developments could reduce the estimated net realizable value of our capitalized software and could result in impairment or a shorter estimated life 
such events would require us to take a charge in the period in which the event occurs or to increase the amortization expense in future periods and would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
at a minimum  we review for impairments each balance sheet date 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to assess the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
the performance test involves a two step process 
step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we measure the fair value of reporting units and other intangible assets using an estimate of the related discounted cash flow and market comparable valuations  where appropriate 
the discounted cash flow model uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 
the key assumptions in the market comparable value analysis are peer group selection and application of this peer group to the respective reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of the respective reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
under such evaluation  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss is recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
there is a high degree of judgment regarding management s forecast for the reporting units as market developments for both customers and competitors can affect actual results 
there can also be uncertainty regarding management s selection of peer companies as an exact match of peer companies is unlikely to exist 
application of the goodwill and other intangibles impairment test requires judgment  including the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow model in combination with a market approach 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  estimation of market interest rates  determination of our weighted average cost of capital and selection and application of peer groups 
the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results  market conditions and estimated future cash flows 
while we believe that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable  a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
at march   our professional services reporting unit failed step of our goodwill impairment analysis 
after performing step of the goodwill impairment test  we determined that it was necessary to record a million impairment to the goodwill associated with our professional services division  reducing the goodwill balance to the calculated implied fair value 
the fair value of the professional services reporting unit was estimated at the balance sheet date primarily using a discounted cash flow model 
assumptions used in the model that have the most significant effect are our estimated growth rates for revenue and margins and estimated weighted average cost of capital 
the decrease in fair value of the professional services reporting unit was driven by a decline in our anticipated future results for the reporting unit which led to a lower fair value 
we will continue to monitor the risk of additional goodwill impairment for the professional services reporting unit  which has a goodwill balance of million at march  we believe we can maintain or grow our professional services revenue and margin 
however  if our professional services revenues or margin continue to decline  we could be required to further reduce the value of goodwill associated with the professional services reporting unit 

table of contents the events and circumstances that could affect our key assumptions for the professional services reporting unit and the analysis of fair value in the future include the following our ability to achieve sales productivity at a level to achieve the profitability in the forecast period 
failure of our billable staff to meet their utilization or rate targets 
our ability to hire and retain sales  technology and management personnel 
future negative changes in the us economy 
increased competition and pricing pressures within the professional services market 
the fair value of each of our other reporting units was substantially in excess of each unit s respective carrying value as of march  deferred tax assets valuation allowance and tax liabilities income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
changes in estimates of projected future operating results or in assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible could result in significant changes to these liabilities and  therefore  to our net income 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc income taxes and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for stock awards in accordance with asc share based payment 
stock award compensation costs  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting term of three to five years 
for stock awards which vest more quickly than a straight line basis  additional expense is taken in the early year s to ensure the expense is commensurate with the vest schedule 
during fiscal  the weighted average forfeiture rate for options and awards granted was the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model with the following average assumptions for fiscal risk free interest rate  volatility factor and expected option life years 
although we have never issued a dividend in the past  in january  our board of directors announced its intention to begin paying cash dividends totaling per share annually  to be paid quarterly beginning in the first quarter of fiscal for options granted after that date  we included a dividend yield assumption in our fair value calculation to consider the payment of a dividend in the future 
the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares granted in fiscal was per option share 
for more information related to these assumptions  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents in addition to the assumptions above  we estimate the expected pre vesting award forfeiture rate and asses the probability that performance conditions that affect the vesting of certain awards will be achieved and take expense only for the awards expected to vest 
if future events impact either the assumptions included in the black scholes option pricing model or our pre vesting forfeiture rate  future stock based compensation expense could be materially different from the expense we have recorded in the current period 
other other accounting policies  although not generally subject to the same level of estimation as those discussed above  are nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
many assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses require some degree of estimation or judgment in determining the appropriate accounting 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   and  cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during was million  a decrease of million from the decrease was primarily due to an million decline in cash collected from customers consistent with the decline in revenue as compared to the prior year and was partially offset by a decline in cash paid for income taxes of million  a decline in cash paid to employees of million resulting from headcount reduction and a decline in cash paid to suppliers of million primarily related to fewer subcontractors 
the consolidated statements of cash flows included in this report compute net cash from operating activities using the indirect cash flow method

we will continue to evaluate business acquisition opportunities that fit our strategic plans 
if the cash consideration for a future acquisition or combination of acquisitions were to exceed our operating cash balance resources  we would likely utilize our credit facility again and may need to seek additional financing 
net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities during was million  which represents a decrease of million from the million of cash provided by financing activities in the change was primarily due to a million increase in purchases of common stock  a million reduction in proceeds from borrowings and a million increase in payments on borrowings partially offset by a million increase in net proceeds from exercise of stock awards during the proceeds from borrowings during were used to fund the dynatrace acquisition 
the proceeds from borrowings during were used to fund our repurchases of common stock

table of contents the consolidated statements of cash flows included in this report compute net cash from operating activities using the indirect cash flow method 
therefore  non cash adjustments and net changes in assets and liabilities net of effects from acquisitions  the divestiture and currency fluctuations are adjusted from net income to derive net cash from operating activities 
the most significant changes in our reconciliation of net income to derive net cash from operating activities during were as follows net income declined million  the impact of the net change in accounts payable and accrued expenses was million  and the depreciation and amortization adjustment to net income increased million 
the decline in net income is due to a larger increase in operating expenses than the increase in revenues for as compared to  primarily related to additional investments in our apm and covisint business segments see results of operations discussion above for the changes in revenue and operating expense by business segment 
the increase from the net change in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due predominantly to bonus payments made during in excess of the payments made during the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to the million in amortization expense recognized during on the intangible assets obtained from the dynatrace acquisition refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information

interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment strategy

installment accounts are generally receivable over a two to five year period 
as of march   non current accounts receivable amounted to million  of which approximately million  million  million  million and  are due in fiscal through fiscal  respectively

foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign exchange rate risks related to assets and liabilities that are denominated in non local currency and current inter company balances due to and from our foreign subsidiaries 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to sell or buy currencies with the intent of mitigating foreign exchange rate risks related to these balances 
we do not currently hedge currency risk related to anticipated revenue or expenses denominated in foreign currency 
all foreign exchange derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts are recognized in income  offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign balances being hedged 
at march   we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the potential loss that a positive or negative change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our income from operations 
based upon the analysis performed  we believe such a change would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
