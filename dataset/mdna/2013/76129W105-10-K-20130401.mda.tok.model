forward looking statement warning certain statements included by reference in this filing containing the words could  may  believes  anticipates  intends  expects  and similar such words constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act 
any forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  our ability to maintain liquidity  our maintenance of patent protection  the impact of current litigation  our ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships  our ability to quickly increase capacity in response to an increase in demand  our ability to access the market  our ability to maintain or lower production costs  our ability to continue to finance research and development as well as operations and expansion of production  the increased interest of larger market players  specifically bd  in providing devices to the safety market  and other factors referenced in item a 
risk factors 
given these uncertainties  undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements 
overview we have been manufacturing and marketing our products since safety syringes comprised of our sales in we also manufacture and market the blood collection tube holder  iv safety catheter  and vanishpoint blood collection set 
we currently provide other safety medical products in addition to safety products utilizing retractable technology 
one such product is the patient safe syringe  which is uniquely designed to reduce the risk of bloodstream infections resulting from catheter hub contamination 
historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demand for syringes during the flu season 
while our sales and expenses have not fluctuated significantly over the last three years  our loss per share for was materially different than and predominantly because of the litigation settlements received in and  as described herein 
our products have been and continue to be distributed nationally and internationally through numerous distributors 
although we have made limited progress in some areas  such as the alternate care market  our volumes are not as high as they should be given the nature and quality of our products and the federal and state legislation requiring the use of safe needle devices 
the alternate care market is composed of alternate care facilities that provide long term nursing and out patient surgery  emergency care  and physician services 
the fact that our progress is limited is principally due to exclusive marketing practices engaged in by bd  the dominant maker and seller of disposable syringes and other needle products  which practices have blocked us from access to the market 
a suit against bd is currently pending alleging violations of state and federal antitrust acts and false advertising 
we continue to pursue various strategies to have better access to the hospital market  as well as other markets  including attempting to gain access to the market through our sales efforts  our innovative technology  introduction of new products  and  when necessary  litigation 

table of contents in the event we continue to have only limited market access and the cash provided by the litigation settlements and generated from operations becomes insufficient  we would take additional cost cutting measures to reduce cash requirements 
such measures could result in the reduction of units being produced  the reduction of workforce  the reduction of salaries of officers and other nonhourly employees  and the deferral of royalty payments 
we took such actions at the end of the second quarter of salary reductions put in place in the second quarter of remain in place for executive officers  but all other employees affected by the salary reduction had their salaries increased by the amount of the reduction  effective august  section of the internal revenue code  enacted by the health care and education reconciliation act of in conjunction with the patient protection and affordable care act  provides for an excise tax of on medical devices beginning in at the present time the excise tax is applicable to domestic sales of our products  except those which are sold to exempt organizations 
the majority of our sales are domestic and not in the retail market 
the tax is imposed on sales  not profits 
we estimate the impact of this tax to be in excess of one million dollars in there is no assurance this tax can be passed along to our customers 
through march   we have paid thousand in medical device excise taxes 
we have brought additional molding operations to little elm as a cost saving measure 
the addition of four molding machines in was part of that endeavor 
we also continue to focus on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to reduce costs 
in and  in connection with a settlement agreement  the company received quarterly option payments  totaling million  from hospira for a one year option to negotiate a licensing agreement for certain uses of the patient safe syringe 
this option expired unexercised in july on september   we commenced an offer to purchase outstanding class b convertible preferred stock for cash and common stock and also engaged in private purchases with three preferred stockholders 
as of december   preferred stockholders had tendered a total of  shares of preferred stock 
a total of  was paid and  shares of common stock were issued as consideration to these preferred stockholders 
these preferred stockholders agreed to waive all unpaid dividends in arrears associated with their tendered preferred stock  which resulted in a waiver of a total of  in unpaid dividends in arrears 
on july   we authorized a common stock repurchase plan structured to comply with rules b and b under the securities exchange act of under the plan  we purchased  shares in notwithstanding the terms of the plan  the exact number of shares which may be purchased in the future pursuant to the plan is difficult to predict given the current market in our common stock 
pursuant to the certificates of designation  preferences  rights and limitations of the series i class b and series ii class b convertible preferred stock  we would be prohibited from purchasing our common stock while dividends are in arrears 
therefore  in order to continue the common stock repurchase plan  we plan to continue to pay quarterly dividends on the series i class b and series ii class b preferred stock if such payments can be made in accordance with state law and other contractual obligations 
product purchases from double dove  a chinese manufacturer  have enabled us to increase manufacturing capacity with little capital outlay and have provided a competitive manufacturing cost 
in  double dove manufactured approximately of the units we produced 
in the event that we become unable to purchase product from our outside supplier  double dove  we would need to find an alternate supplier for the ml insulin syringe  the ml autodisable syringe  and the ml and ml syringes and we would increase domestic production for the ml and ml syringes 
in  we entered into a license agreement with thomas j 
shaw for the exclusive right to manufacture  market  and distribute products utilizing automated retraction technology 
this technology is the subject of various patents and patent applications owned by mr 
shaw 
the license agreement generally provides for quarterly payments of a royalty fee on gross sales 
this license agreement was amended as of september  to clarify and set forth the calculation and amount of the royalty  including in the event that we have sublicensed our products 

table of contents with increased volumes  our manufacturing unit costs have generally tended to decline 
factors that could affect our unit costs include increases in costs by third party manufacturers  changing production volumes  costs of petroleum products  and transportation costs 
increases in such costs may not be recoverable through price increases of our products 
results of operations the following discussion contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from our historical results of operations and those discussed in the forward looking statements 
all period references are to our fiscal years ended december   or dollar amounts have been rounded for ease of reading 
comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  domestic sales accounted for and of the revenues in and  respectively 
domestic revenues decreased principally due to a decrease in unit sales and a lower average price 
domestic unit sales decreased 
domestic unit sales were of total unit sales for international revenues increased from million in to million in  primarily due to higher volumes mitigated by lower average prices 
overall unit sales increased 
our international orders may be subject to significant fluctuation over time 
such orders may fluctuate due to health initiatives at various times  as well as economic conditions 
cost of sales increased million due to greater sales volumes mitigated by a decrease of million due to lower unit costs of manufacture 
royalty expenses increased thousand due to higher gross sales 
gross profit margins decreased from in to in operating expenses increased from the prior year due to higher compensation in our sales and marketing department attributable to increasing sales and marketing staff and bonus pay as well as increased travel and entertainment expense 
our litigation costs were higher in these increases in costs were reduced by lower costs of patents and bad debt expense 
loss from operations was million in compared to an operating loss of million in in  litigation settlements  net reflected cash proceeds of million net of a thousand royalty payment 
cash flow from operations was thousand for due primarily to decreases in current assets and increases in current liabilities 
the effect of the net loss was mitigated by non cash charges  principally depreciation 
comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  revenues decreased  due principally to lower volume and lower average sales price 
domestic sales were of revenues with international sales comprising the remainder 
unit sales decreased 
domestic unit sales decreased and average sales prices decreased 
international unit sales decreased and average international selling prices decreased 
cost of sales decreased due to lower volumes and lower unit costs 
royalty expenses decreased due to lower gross sales revenues 
as a result  gross profit margins decreased from in to in operating expenses decreased from the prior year due to lower litigation costs of million  lower stock option expense of million  bonuses paid in of thousand  and an impairment charge of thousand in bad debt expense and legal expenses related to patent matters increased 
lower litigation costs are the result of an agreement between us and our counsel to cap certain litigation fees 

table of contents loss from operations was million in compared to an operating loss in of million 
litigation settlements  net reflects cash proceeds of million net of a thousand royalty payment 
the provision for income taxes consists principally of thousand of state and local income taxes and a credit to federal income tax of thousand 
cash flow from operations was million for due principally to litigation settlements  a reduction in accounts receivable balances and inventories 
a decrease in accrued liabilities and net income mitigated the increase in cash flow 
liquidity at the present time  management does not intend to raise equity capital 
due to the funds received from prior litigation settlements  we have sufficient cash reserves and intend to rely on operations  cash reserves  and debt financing as the primary ongoing sources of cash 
our note to katie petroleum was paid in full in september our payments were approximately  per month 
historical sources of liquidity we have historically funded operations primarily from the proceeds from revenues  private placements  litigation settlements  and loans 
internal sources of liquidity margins and market access to routinely achieve break even quarters  we need minimal access to hospital markets which has been difficult to obtain due to the monopolistic marketplace which was the subject of our initial lawsuit and now also included in our second antitrust lawsuit against bd 
we will continue to attempt to gain access to the market through our sales efforts  innovative technology  the introduction of new products  and  when necessary  litigation 
we continue to focus on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to reduce costs 
fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and inventory and our ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships could result in the need to manufacture all as opposed to of our products in the us this could temporarily increase unit costs as we ramp up domestic production 
the mix of domestic and international sales affects the average sales price of our products 
generally  the higher the ratio of domestic sales to international sales  the higher the average sales price will be 
typically international sales are shipped directly from china to the customer 
purchases of product manufactured in china  if available  usually decrease the average cost of manufacture for all units 
domestic costs  such as indirect labor and overhead  remain relatively constant 
the number of units produced by us versus manufactured in china can have a significant effect on the carrying costs of inventory as well as cost of sales 
we will continue to evaluate the appropriate mix of products manufactured domestically and those manufactured in china to achieve economic benefits as well as to maintain our domestic manufacturing capability 
fluctuations in the cost of oil since our products are petroleum based and transportation and the volume of units purchased from double dove may have an impact on the unit costs of our product 
increases in such costs may not be recoverable through price increases of our products 
reductions in oil prices may not quickly affect petroleum product prices 

table of contents seasonality historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demand for syringes during the flu season 
cash requirements due to funds received from prior litigation settlements  we have sufficient cash reserves and intend to rely on operations  cash reserves  and debt financing as the primary ongoing sources of cash 
in the event we continue to have only limited market access and cash generated from operations becomes insufficient to support operations  we would take additional cost cutting measures to reduce cash requirements 
such measures could result in the reduction of units being produced  the reduction of workforce  the reduction of salaries of officers and other nonhourly employees  and the deferral of royalty payments 
external sources of liquidity we have obtained several loans from our inception  which have  together with the proceeds from the sales of equities and litigation efforts  enabled us to pursue development and production of our products 
given the current economic conditions  our ability to obtain additional funds through loans is uncertain 
furthermore  the shareholders previously authorized an additional  shares of a class c preferred stock that could  if necessary  be designated and used to raise funds through the sale of equity 
due to the current market price of our common stock  it is unlikely we would choose to raise funds by the sale of equity 
in and  in connection with a settlement agreement  the company received quarterly option payments  totaling million  from hospira  inc for a one year option to negotiate a licensing agreement for certain uses of the patient safe syringe 
this option expired unexercised in july on july   thomas j 
shaw  our chief executive officer  exercised a portion of his stock option 
the company issued  shares of common stock to him at an exercise price of aggregate consideration of 
capital resources repurchase of common stock on july   we authorized a common stock repurchase plan structured to comply with rules b and b under the securities exchange act of under the plan  we purchased  shares in notwithstanding the terms of the plan  the exact number of shares which may be purchased in the future pursuant to the plan is difficult to predict given the current market in our common stock 
pursuant to the certificates of designation  preferences  rights and limitations of the series i class b and series ii class b convertible preferred stock  we would be prohibited from purchasing our common stock while dividends are in arrears 
therefore  in order to continue the common stock repurchase plan  we plan to continue to pay dividends on the series i class b and series ii class b preferred stock if such payments can be made in accordance with state law and other contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following chart summarizes our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts for long term debt as of december  
table of contents payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations long term debt operating leases total significant accounting policies we consider the following to be our most significant accounting policies 
careful consideration and review is given to these and all accounting policies on a routine basis to ensure that they are accurately and consistently applied 
accounts receivable we record trade receivables when revenue is recognized 
no product has been consigned to customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily determined by review of specific trade receivables 
those accounts that are doubtful of collection are included in the allowance 
this provision is reviewed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables are charged off when there is certainty as to their being uncollectible 
trade receivables are considered delinquent when payment has not been made within contract terms 
we require certain distributors to make a prepayment prior to beginning production or shipment of their order 
distributors may apply such prepayments to their outstanding invoices or pay the invoice and continue to carryforward the deposit for future orders 
such amounts are included in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheets and are shown in note  other accrued liabilities 
we record an allowance for estimated returns as a reduction to accounts receivable and gross sales 
historically  returns have been immaterial 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for sales when title and risk of ownership passes to the customer  generally upon shipment 
under certain contracts  revenue is recorded on the basis of sales price to distributors  less contractual pricing allowances 
contractual pricing allowances consist of i rebates granted to distributors who provide tracking reports which show  among other things  the facility that purchased the products  and ii a provision for estimated contractual pricing allowances for products that we have not received tracking reports 
rebates are recorded when issued and are applied against the customer s receivable balance 
distributors receive a rebate for the difference between the wholesale acquisition cost and the appropriate contract price as reflected on a tracking report provided by the distributor to us 
if product is sold by a distributor to an entity that has no contract  there is a standard rebate lower than a contracted rebate given to the distributor 
one of the purposes of the rebate is to encourage distributors to submit tracking reports to us 
the provision for contractual pricing allowances is reviewed at the end of each quarter and adjusted for changes in levels of products for which there is no tracking report 
additionally  if it becomes clear that tracking reports will not be provided by individual distributors  the provision is further adjusted 
the estimated contractual allowance is included in accounts payable in the balance sheets and deducted from revenues in the statements of operations 
accounts payable included estimated contractual allowances for  and  for and  respectively 
the terms and conditions of contractual pricing allowances are governed by contracts between us and our distributors 
revenue for shipments directly to end users is recognized when title and risk of ownership passes from us 
any product shipped or distributed for evaluation purposes is expensed 

table of contents certain distributors have taken rebates to which they are not entitled  such as utilizing a rebate for products not purchased directly from us 
we have been in discussions with the principal customers that claimed non contractual rebates 
major customers said they have ceased the practices resulting in claiming non contractual rebates 
rebates can only be claimed on purchases made directly from us 
we have established a reserve for the collectability of these non contractual rebate amounts 
the expense for the reserve is recorded in operating expense  general and administrative 
the reserve for such non contractual deductions is included in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our domestic return policy is set forth in our standard distribution agreement 
this policy provides that a customer may return incorrect shipments within days following arrival at the distributor s facility 
in all such cases the distributor must obtain an authorization code from us and affix the code to the returned product 
we will not accept returned goods without a returned goods authorization number 
we may refund the customer s money or replace the product 
our domestic return policy also generally provides that a customer may return product that is overstocked 
overstocking returns are limited to two times in each month period up to of distributor s total purchase of products for the prior month period 
all product overstocks and returns are subject to inspection and acceptance by us 
our international distribution agreements generally do not provide for any returns 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using actual average cost 
we compare the average cost to the market price and record the lower value 
management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time to sell such inventory  the shelf life of inventory  and current market conditions when determining excess or obsolete inventories 
a reserve is established for any excess or obsolete inventories or they may be written off 
marketing fees in prior periods  marketing fees payable to abbott were included in current liabilities in the balance sheets 
in connection with the settlement with abbott  marketing fees payable recorded in previous periods will not have to be paid 
the reversal of this accrual is included in litigation settlements  net on the statements of operations in recent pronouncement on october   the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  technical corrections and improvements 
this asu makes certain incremental improvements to us gaap  including  among other revisions  conforming amendments that identify when the use of fair value should be linked to the definition of fair value in asc the majority of the amendments in asu were effective upon issuance and the more substantive amendments that are subject to transition guidance are effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of this asu did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows or financial statement disclosures and we do not expect the future adoption of the transition provisions of this asu to have a material impact on such items 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our market risk exposures regarding our cash and cash equivalents are immaterial as we do not have instruments for trading purposes 
we shifted the bulk of our funds into us treasury bills and other us government backed securities in april additionally  reasonable  possible near term changes in market rates or prices will not result in material changes in near term earnings
