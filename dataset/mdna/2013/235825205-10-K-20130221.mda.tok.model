additional engineering and operational investment is being channeled into reinvigorating our product portfolio and capitalizing on technology advancement opportunities 
we recently combined the north american engineering centers of our lvd and commercial vehicle segments  allowing us the opportunity to better share technologies among these businesses 
our new engineering facilities in india and china more than doubled our engineering presence in the asia pacific region with state of the art design and test capabilities that globally support each of our businesses 
geographic expansion although there are growth opportunities in each region  we have a primary focus in the asia pacific region  especially india and china 
in addition to new engineering facilities in india and china  a new hypoid gear manufacturing facility in india began production in and we also completed two transactions increasing the ownership interest in our china based joint venture with dongfeng motor co  ltd 
dongfeng to and acquiring the axle drive head and final assembly business from our axles india limited ail joint venture which significantly increased our commercial vehicle driveline presence in the region 
we have expanded our china off highway activities and we believe there is considerable opportunity for growth in this market 
earlier this year  we opened a business development office in moscow  russia to focus on expanding our business opportunities in this region 
in south america  our strategic agreement with sifco sa sifco  entered in february  makes us the leading full driveline supplier in the south american commercial vehicle market 
aftermarket opportunities we have a global group dedicated to identifying and developing aftermarket growth opportunities that leverage the capabilities within our existing businesses targeting increased future aftermarket revenues as a percent of consolidated sales 
selective acquisitions our current acquisition focus is to identify bolt on acquisition opportunities like the sifco and ail transactions that have a strategic fit with our existing businesses  particularly opportunities that support our growth initiatives and enhance the value proposition of our customer product offerings 
any potential acquisition will be evaluated in the same manner we currently consider customer program opportunities with a disciplined financial approach designed to ensure profitable growth 
cost management although we have taken significant strides to improve our margins  particularly through streamlining and rationalizing our manufacturing activities and rationalizing our administrative support processes  additional opportunities remain 
we have ramped up our material cost efforts to ensure that we are rationalizing our supply base and obtaining appropriate competitive pricing 
further  we are putting a major focus on reducing product complexity something that not only improves our cost  but also brings added value to our customers through more efficient assembly processes 
with a continued emphasis on process improvements and productivity throughout the organization  we expect cost reductions to continue contributing to future margin improvement

in return for a payment of to sifco  we acquired the distribution rights to sifco commercial vehicle steer axle systems as well as an exclusive long term supply agreement for key driveline components 
additionally  sifco has provided selected assets and assistance to dana to establish assembly capabilities for these systems 
we are responsible for all customer relationships  including marketing  sales  engineering and assembly 
the addition of truck and bus steer axles to our product offering in south america effectively positions us as the leading full line supplier of commercial vehicle drivelines including front and rear axles  driveshafts and suspension systems in south america 
dongfeng dana axle in june  we paid to increase our equity investment in dongfeng dana axle co  ltd 
ddac from to 
our investment in ddac is being accounted for on the equity method 
ddac is the primary supplier of truck axles to dongfeng 
ddac offers a complete range of truck axles in the chinese market  including drive  steer  tandem  and hub reduction axles for light  medium and heavy duty trucks  as well as buses 
axles india in june  we acquired the axle drive head and final assembly business of our ail equity affiliate for dana rexroth transmission systems in october  we formed a joint venture with bosch rexroth to develop and manufacture advanced powersplit drive transmissions for the off highway market 
we contributed to the venture and are accounting for our investment under the equity method 
both dana and bosch rexroth contributed an additional to the venture in the third quarter of fallbrook in september  we entered into a strategic alliance with fallbrook technologies inc in connection with this transaction  we obtained an exclusive license to fallbrook s continuously variable planetary cvp technology  allowing dana to engineer  produce and sell driveline products using this technology for passenger and certain off highway vehicles in the end markets dana serves 
as part of this alliance  fallbrook will also provide dana with development and other support through an engineering services agreement and several fallbrook engineers have been hired by dana 
under the exclusive license agreement  dana will pay fallbrook for the markets licensed to dana  was paid at closing  an additional was paid during the fourth quarter of and the remaining will be paid over the first half of divestitures divestiture of structural products business in  we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our structural products business to metalsa sa de sa metalsa 
we had received cash proceeds of by the end of and remains in escrow pending resolution of claims presented by metalsa 
the structural products business that we retained generated sales of in and in through the august cessation date 
prior to the third quarter of  structural products was reported as an operating segment of continuing operations 
with the cessation of operations in this year s third quarter  the activities relating to the structural products operation are now reported as discontinued operations 
divestiture of getrag entities on september   we completed the divestitures of our equity interest in getrag corporation and our equity interest in getrag dana holding gmbh for divestiture of leisure and all terrain business we completed the divestiture of our axle  differential and brake systems business serving the leisure  all terrain and utility vehicle markets in august the total proceeds received of approximated the net assets of the business following an asset impairment charge of recorded in the first quarter of sales of the divested business approximated in and in through the date of the divestiture 
segments we manage our operations globally through four operating segments 
our lvd and power technologies segments primarily support light vehicle original equipment manufacturers oems with products for light trucks  suvs  cuvs  vans and passenger cars 
the commercial vehicle segment supports the oems of on highway commercial vehicles primarily trucks and buses  while our off highway segment supports oems of off highway vehicles primarily wheeled vehicles used in construction and agricultural applications 
trends in our markets global vehicle production actual units in thousands dana outlook north america light vehicle total  to   light truck full frame  to   medium truck classes to heavy truck class to agricultural equipment to construction equipment to europe including e 
europe light vehicle  to   medium heavy truck to agricultural equipment to construction equipment to south america light vehicle  to    medium heavy truck to agricultural equipment to construction equipment to asia pacific light vehicle  to   medium heavy truck  to   agricultural equipment to construction equipment to north america light vehicle markets improving economic conditions during the past three years have contributed to increased light vehicle sales and production levels in north america 
release of built up demand to replace older vehicles and greater availability of credit have also stimulated new vehicle sales 
production of approximately million light vehicles in was higher than production of million vehicles  which was up about from production of million units in the higher production occurred predominantly in the passenger car and crossover segments 
in the full frame light truck segment where more of our programs are focused  production was up about in after increasing in the higher production levels are generally reflective of higher light vehicle unit sales which were about higher in than in after expanding about in the prior year 
due in part to volatility in fuel prices  sales increases in the full frame light truck segment were more modest up in and in days supply of total light vehicles in the us at the end of december was around days  up slightly from days at the end of and days at the end of the increase in overall light vehicle inventory levels is attributable primarily to the full frame light truck segment where inventory levels increased to days at the end of  as compared to days at the end of and days at the end of looking ahead to  we expect that continued overall strengthening in the north american markets will increase light vehicle sales and production  but at lower rates than in the past two years 
an improved financing environment and housing sector along with more stable fuel prices are positive developments 
but unemployment levels continue to be relatively high  and recent us government actions increasing taxes on consumers without addressing government spending levels added to the considerable uncertainty about economic prospects in adverse economic developments in europe and other parts of the world experiencing slowed economic growth have added further uncertainty  impacting consumer confidence within the north american markets 
our current outlook for light vehicle production is to million units  a to increase over  with full frame light trucks expected to be flat to down approximately as compared with medium heavy vehicle markets as with the light vehicle market  medium heavy truck production has increased over the past three years 
although production levels were higher in  the pace of improvement in these markets in was lower than we expected at the start of the slower than expected improvement in economic conditions and continued uncertainty with the economic outlook has had a more profound impact on the commercial market leading to a slowdown in new vehicle order levels during the second half of heavy duty class truck production of about  units was up approximately over after increasing more than in in the medium duty classes segment  production levels were approximately higher in than in  down considerably from a more than increase in production in with the mixed and uncertain outlook surrounding the north america economy  we currently expect class production to be in the range of  to  units  which is flat to down compared with we expect medium duty classes production for to range from  to  units  also flat to down compared with production levels in markets outside of north america light vehicle markets european production levels have been adversely impacted by overall economic weakness brought on in part by sovereign debt concerns  high unemployment levels  governmental austerity actions in many countries and other economic factors 
european production of light vehicles was down about in after being up in we expect the tough economic environment to persist throughout much of  casting considerable uncertainly on vehicle production expectations 
given the uncertain environment  we currently expect european light vehicle production in to be flat to down compared with after increasing the previous two years  south american production levels weakened in  with light vehicle production down about from last year 
at present  we expect full year production levels to increase from to over volume 
light vehicle production in the asia pacific region was up more than in  rebounding from production levels in that were adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters in japan and thailand 
we expect production levels in to remain solid  coming in flat to up from medium heavy vehicle markets some of the same factors referenced above that affected light vehicle markets outside of north america similarly affected the medium heavy markets 
the challenging economic environment in europe was a primary driver of a decline in medium heavy truck production in after a more than increase in with economic difficulties lingering into  our outlook for europe production has production levels in the range of levels plus or minus 
south american medium heavy truck production levels were down more than in due largely to overall economic weakness in the region and a pull back in purchases caused by engine emissions changes in brazil 
in contrast  production in was up nearly from with the brazil emissions effects behind us and some improvement in economic conditions  our outlook for has medium heavy truck production rebounding and coming in about to higher than in asia pacific medium heavy truck production in was adversely impacted by slower growth in china  coming in more than lower than levels 
this reduced level of production in followed a production decline of about in as a consequence of the natural disasters which disrupted production that year 
we expect the pent up demand for trucks after two years of restrained production  along with some economic strengthening  will raise production levels by about to 
off highway markets our off highway business has a large presence outside of north america  with about of its sales coming from europe and from south america and asia pacific combined 
we serve several segments of the diverse off highway market  including construction  agriculture  mining and material handling 
our largest markets are the construction and agricultural equipment segments  both of which experienced increased demand during the past three years  with overall growth slowing in  increasing across all regions 
our outlook for the agriculture and construction markets are expected to be flat to up over commodity costs the cost of our products may be significantly impacted by changes in raw material commodity prices  the most important to us being those of various grades of steel  aluminum  copper  and brass 
the effects of changes in commodity prices are reflected directly in our purchases of commodities and indirectly through our purchases of products such as castings  forgings  bearings  and component parts that include commodities 
most of our major customer agreements have provisions which allow us to pass the effects of significant commodity price changes through to those customers 
where such formal agreements are not present  we have historically been successful implementing price adjustments that compensate for the inflationary impact of material costs 
material cost changes will customarily have some impact on our financial results as the contractual recoveries and inflation based pricing adjustments typically lag the cost increases 
higher commodity prices increased our costs by approximately in and in  while material recovery and other pricing actions increased sales by about in and in sales  earnings and cash flow outlook outlook sales     adjusted ebitda free cash flow adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure discussed under segment ebitda within the segment results of operations discussion below 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure  which we have defined as cash provided by operating activities excluding any bankruptcy claim related payments  less purchases of property  plant and equipment 
we believe this measure is useful to investors in evaluating the operational cash flow of the company inclusive of the spending required to maintain the operations 
free cash flow is neither intended to represent nor be an alternative to the measure of net cash provided by operating activities reported under gaap 
free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
free cash flow is reconciled to cash flow provided by operations below net cash provided by operating activities purchases of property  plant and equipment reorganization related claims payments free cash flow during the past three years  significant focus was placed on right sizing and rationalizing our manufacturing operations  implementing other cost reduction initiatives and ensuring that customer programs were competitively priced 
at the same time  we began putting increased focus and investment into product technology 
these efforts  along with stronger sales volumes in and  were the primary drivers of our improved profitability 
with our financial position substantially improved  in we began directing increased attention to the growth initiatives described in the operational and strategic initiatives section above 
certain acquisitions also contributed to the sales growth we achieved in our sales have been adversely impacted by weaker international exchange rates 
adjusted for exchange rates  sales were about the same as  with softened demand levels  principally in the europe region and in the south and north american medium heavy truck markets  being offset by stronger demand levels in the light vehicle and off highway markets 
for  we are expecting market demand and pricing across all businesses will increase sales by about  however  we expect that this will be more than offset by scheduled roll off of customer programs and currency 
as a result  our sales outlook is around  a decline of about from despite the reduced level of sales  we expect continued improvement in adjusted ebitda to to in from in as we benefit from restructuring  cost reduction and pricing actions  a significant portion of which have already been implemented 
our cash flow in recent years benefited primarily from increased earnings and lower capital spending  more than offsetting the higher working capital requirements associated with increased sales  higher tax obligations and larger pension funding commitments 
free cash flow in included a voluntary contribution to our us pension plans 
for  we expect free cash flow to be to down to from free cash flow when adjusted to exclude the voluntary pension contribution 
higher cash taxes  capital expenditures and working capital requirements are partially offset by higher earnings 
cash taxes are expected to total about to in compared to in and capital expenditures for the year are expected to be to compared to in pension contributions in are expected to be around  which is similar to after excluding that year s incremental funding of expected cash requirements for interest of about and restructuring of to are comparable with consolidated results of operations summary consolidated results of operations versus increase decrease net sales   cost of sales   gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles restructuring charges  net other income  net income from continuing operations before interest expense and income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income attributable to the parent company sales the following table shows changes in our sales by geographic region

the growth was largely due to increased oem production levels in the light vehicle and medium heavy truck markets 
full frame light truck production levels were higher in while medium heavy truck production was up 
partially offsetting the overall market volume increases was the scheduled roll off of certain light vehicle programs 
excluding currency effects  our sales in europe were higher than in new customer programs in lvd and off highway  increased aftermarket sales and off highway export sales were the primary drivers of the organic sales increase  more than offsetting the effects of lower light vehicle and medium heavy truck production levels 
south america sales in were adversely impacted by currency and significantly lower market demand 
with medium heavy truck production down and light vehicle production down  lower production levels were the principal factor in sales exclusive of currency effects being lower than in the ail acquisition in the second quarter of contributed of the asia pacific sales increase 
the organic sales growth of in asia pacific primarily reflects the improving production levels in the region as compared to along with increased sales from new customer programs 
cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales for was about lower than in as with sales  the reduction was in large part caused by the effects of weaker international currencies  and the volume decline that drove a reduction in sales volume of about also contributed to the decrease 
with the larger reduction in costs than sales  we reduced cost of sales as a percent of sales to in from in through continued supplier rationalization and engineering design actions  we achieved incremental material cost reductions of approximately  which partially offset higher commodity costs of about product quality improvements over the years contributed to a reduction in warranty costs in of the remaining cost improvements were primarily attributable to the completion of additional restructuring initiatives and a continued drive for operational cost savings throughout the organization 
gross margin of in increased over  representing of sales in as compared to of sales in in addition to the above mentioned reductions to cost of sales  gross margins as a percent of sales in benefited from the scheduled roll off in of lower margin customer programs and improved pricing and material recovery actions which improved gross margin by about selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses in were of sales as compared to of sales in contributing to the higher costs were increases in certain benefit costs such as stock compensation which increased by asbestos related expenses in were higher by  due in part to a settlement with one of our insurers that favorably impacted expense in the remaining increase is due in part to some higher cost to support our growth initiatives 
restructuring charges  net restructuring charges in both and were primarily employee separation costs and exit costs associated with workforce reduction actions and facility closures 
restructuring expense in was lower as most of our facility rationalization and consolidation plans were completed in expenses in related primarily to some continued work force reductions and costs associated with previously announced actions 
in the second quarter of  we ceased use of our kalamazoo  michigan facility and recognized a charge of to accrue the estimated fair value of the remaining lease obligation

in the us and certain other countries  our recent history of operating losses does not allow us to satisfy the more likely than not criterion for recognition of deferred tax assets 
therefore  there is generally no income tax recognized on the pre tax income or losses in these jurisdictions as valuation allowance adjustments offset the associated tax effects

light vehicle production levels were higher in while medium heavy truck market production was up about

the organic sales growth of in asia pacific reflects overall production levels for the region which were about the same as  tempered by the effects of the earthquake in japan and floods in thailand 
cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales increased  less than the increase in sales which reduced cost of sales as a percent of sales to of sales in from of sales in higher production levels contributed to improved absorption of fixed costs

in connection with this action  we determined that the valuation allowances were no longer required 
reversal of these valuation allowances resulted in a tax benefit of in the us and certain other countries  our recent history of operating losses does not allow us to satisfy the more likely than not criterion for recognition of deferred tax assets 
therefore  there is generally no income tax recognized on the pre tax income or losses of these jurisdictions as valuation allowance adjustments offset the associated tax effect

non gaap financial measures the table above refers to adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure which we have defined as earnings from continuing and discontinued operations before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  non cash equity grant expense  restructuring expense and other nonrecurring items gain loss on debt extinguishment or divestitures  impairment  etc the most significant impact on dana s ongoing results of operations as a result of applying fresh start accounting following our emergence from bankruptcy was higher depreciation and amortization 
by using adjusted ebitda  a performance measure which excludes depreciation and amortization  the comparability of results is enhanced 
management also believes that adjusted ebitda is an important measure since the financial covenants in our debt agreements are based  in part  on adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for income before income taxes  net income or other results reported in accordance with gaap

lvd segment ebitda of improved in ebitda as a percent of lvd sales improved to in from in higher sales volumes  the result of stronger market production levels  increased earnings by about with additional earnings improvement coming from cost reductions 
the profit improvement from these actions was partially offset by higher commodity material costs  net of recoveries  and by certain pricing actions that favorably impacted but did not continue into in the power technologies segment  ebitda of for was up over ebitda as a percent of sales of in was about the same as in the previous year 
higher sales volumes from increased production levels contributed about of the increase 
cost reduction and other benefits were more than offset by higher raw material and warranty costs 
commercial vehicle segment ebitda for was  an increase of over segment ebitda as a percent of sales in was  up from in stronger production levels in this segment s established markets added to the increased segment ebitda  with the sifco transaction adding another for the comparative periods  pricing and cost reduction actions more than offset higher material commodity costs  net of recoveries  and higher premium freight costs incurred to satisfy customer requirements 
in our off highway segment  segment ebitda of for was up from improving market conditions in this business drove stronger sales volume which increased year over year segment ebitda by about the additional improvement in earnings came principally from pricing actions and cost reductions  more than offsetting increased commodity material costs  net of recoveries 
with the higher sales and other benefits  segment ebitda margin improved to for from in liquidity our global liquidity at december  was as follows cash and cash equivalents  less deposits supporting obligations available cash  additional cash availability from lines of credit in the us and europe marketable securities total global liquidity  cash deposits are maintained to provide credit enhancement for certain agreements and are reported as part of cash and cash equivalents 
for most of these deposits  the cash may be withdrawn if comparable security is provided in the form of letters of credit 
accordingly  these deposits are not considered to be restricted 
marketable securities are included as a component of global liquidity as these investments can be readily liquidated at our discretion 
the components of our december  consolidated cash balance were as follows us us total cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents held as deposits cash and cash equivalents held at less than wholly owned subsidiaries consolidated cash balance  a portion of the non us cash and cash equivalents is utilized for working capital and other operating purposes 
several countries have local regulatory requirements that significantly restrict the ability of our operations to repatriate this cash 
beyond these restrictions  there are practical limitations on repatriation of cash from certain subsidiaries because of the resulting tax withholdings and subsidiary by law restrictions which could limit our ability to access cash and other assets 
the principal sources of liquidity available for our future cash requirements are expected to be i cash flows from operations  ii cash and cash equivalents on hand  iii borrowings from our european accounts receivable backed credit facility and iv borrowings from our revolving facility 
we believe that our overall liquidity and operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for capital expenditures  working capital  debt obligations and other commitments during the next twelve months 
while uncertainty surrounding the current economic environment could adversely impact our business  based on our current financial position  we believe it is unlikely that any such effects would preclude us from maintaining sufficient liquidity 
at december   there was of availability  but no borrowings  under our european accounts receivable backed credit facility based on the effective borrowing base 
at december   we had no borrowings under the revolving facility but we had utilized for letters of credit 
based on our borrowing base collateral  we had availability as of that date under the revolving facility of after deducting the outstanding letters of credit 
as a result  we had aggregate additional borrowing availability of under these credit facilities 
on october   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to of our outstanding shares of common stock over a two year period 
we plan to repurchase shares utilizing available excess cash either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
stock repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions and other considerations 
in february  the venezuela government announced a devaluation of their currency from bolivars to the us dollar to bolivars to the us dollar 
based on our net monetary assets denominated in bolivars at the time of the devaluation  we expect to take a one time charge resulting from the devaluation of about in our results for the quarter ending march  we are continuing to evaluate the full effects of the devaluation  which we currently believe could offset some of the one time cost over the full year the venezuelan government maintains tight controls over its currency exchange market 
these restrictions could affect our venezuelan operations ability to pay obligations denominated in us dollars as well our ability to benefit from those operations 
from time to time  depending upon market  pricing and other conditions  as well as our cash balances and liquidity  we may seek to acquire notes or other indebtedness or other securities of the company  including shares of our preferred stock  through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  tender offers  redemption or otherwise  upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine or as may be provided for in the indentures governing the notes  for cash or other consideration 
there can be no assurance that we will pursue any such transactions in the future  as the pursuit of any alternative will depend upon numerous factors such as market conditions  our financial performance and the limitations applicable to such transactions under our financing and governance documents 
cash flow cash provided by used for changes in working capital reorganization related tax claim payment other cash provided by operations net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the table above summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows 
exclusive of working capital and a reorganization related tax claim payment in  other cash provided by operations was during compared to during and during the decrease in was due primarily to of contributions to the us defined benefit pension plans in as compared to in and an increased use of cash for the payment of income taxes  partially offset by higher operating earnings 
the increase in was due primarily to an increased level of operating earnings partially offset by an increased use of cash for payment of income taxes 
working capital generated cash of in versus using cash of in lower sales levels in as compared to resulted in decreased levels of receivables and inventories 
cash of was generated from declining receivables in versus a use of to finance increased receivables in we also generated from lower inventory levels versus a use of cash of to fund higher inventory levels in largely offsetting the generation of cash resulting from decreased levels of receivables and inventories in was a use of cash to reduce accounts payable and other net liabilities 
in  the cash used for higher receivables and inventory was partially offset by cash provided by increases in accounts payable and other net liabilities of  which was reduced by a payment of in for satisfaction of an accrued warranty settlement 
working capital used cash of in as compared to cash generation of in higher sales levels in as compared to resulted in increased levels of receivables and inventory 
cash of was used in to finance increased receivables versus a use of in we also used cash of and to fund higher inventory levels in and partially offsetting the cash use for higher receivables and inventory in both and was cash provided by increases in accounts payable and other net liabilities of in and in partially offsetting the increased accounts payable and other liabilities in was a payment of for satisfaction of an accrued warranty settlement and payments of liabilities accrued at the end of under our incentive compensation programs 
investing activities during  we paid related to our strategic alliance with fallbrook and we received proceeds of from the sale of our axle  differential and brake systems business serving the leisure  all terrain and utility vehicle markets 
in  we paid to enter our strategic agreement with sifco  to increase our ownership in ddac  to acquire the axle drive head and final assembly business of axles india and to form a joint venture  dana rexroth transmission systems  with bosch rexroth 
the sale of our getrag equity interests in provided the sale of the structural products business provided in with of additional proceeds in under the earn out provision of the sale agreement 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment in were as compared to in and in financing activities during  we increased borrowings primarily in international locations experiencing historically favorable interest rates 
we used for dividend payments to preferred stockholders  for dividend payments to common stockholders and to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program 
we used cash of in to refinance our term debt 
in connection with the refinancing  we received proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of and used for issuance costs associated with the term debt refinancing and restructuring of other financing arrangements 
we also used for dividend payments to preferred stockholders 
the use of cash in for financing activities was principally due to repaying term debt with proceeds from the sale of the structural products business 
dividend payments to preferred stockholders consumed cash of in  including for previously accrued dividends 
partially offsetting these cash uses were proceeds of from the issuance of long term debt 
contractual obligations we are obligated to make future cash payments in fixed amounts under various agreements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period after contractual cash obligations total long term debt interest payments leases unconditional purchase obligations pension contribution retiree health care benefits uncertain income tax positions total contractual cash obligations  notes principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations in place at december  these amounts represent future interest payments based on the debt and capital leases in place at december  and the interest rates applicable to such obligations 
operating leases related to real estate  vehicles and other assets 
the unconditional purchase obligations presented are comprised principally of commitments for procurement of fixed assets and the purchase of raw materials 
this amount represents estimated minimum required contributions to our global defined benefit pension plans 
we have not estimated pension contributions beyond due to the significant impact that return on plan assets and changes in discount rates might have on such amounts 
the amount excludes we currently plan to voluntarily contribute to our us plans in this amount represents estimated payments under our non us retiree health care programs 
obligations under the non us retiree health care programs are not fixed commitments and will vary depending on various factors  including the level of participant utilization and inflation 
our estimates of the payments to be made in the future consider recent payment trends and certain of our actuarial assumptions 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to uncertain tax positions because the timing of settlement is uncertain 
the above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits at december  of see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for additional discussion 
preferred dividends accrued but not paid were at the end of both and at december   we maintained cash balances of on deposit with financial institutions to support surety bonds  letters of credit and bank guarantees and to provide credit enhancements for certain lease agreements 
these surety bonds enable us to self insure our workers compensation obligations 
we accrue the estimated liability for workers compensation claims  including incurred but not reported claims 
accordingly  no significant impact on our financial condition would result if the surety bonds were called 
contingencies for a summary of litigation and other contingencies  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item we believe that any liabilities beyond the amounts already accrued that may result from these contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to use estimates and make judgments and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
considerable judgment is often involved in making these determinations 
critical estimates are those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we evaluate these estimates and judgments on a regular basis 
we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
however  the use of different assumptions could result in significantly different results and actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following discussion of accounting estimates is intended to supplement the summary of significant accounting policies presented as note to our consolidated financial statements in item income taxes accounting for income taxes is complex  in part because we conduct business globally and therefore file income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the income tax provision  uncertain tax positions  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is provided when  in our judgment based upon available information  it is more likely than not that a portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to make this assessment  we consider the historical and projected future taxable income or loss in different tax jurisdictions and we review our tax planning strategies 
we have recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in the us and other foreign jurisdictions where realization has been determined to be uncertain 
since future financial results may differ from previous estimates  periodic adjustments to our valuation allowances may be necessary 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain 
we are regularly under audit by the various applicable tax authorities 
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  we believe that we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns and that our annual tax provisions include amounts sufficient to pay assessments  if any  which may be proposed by the taxing authorities 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
see additional discussion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in note to our consolidated financial statements in item retiree benefits accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits opeb involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost to the time period each employee works 
these plan expenses and obligations are dependent on assumptions developed by us in consultation with our outside advisors such as actuaries and other consultants and are generally calculated independently of funding requirements 
the assumptions used  including inflation  discount rates  investment returns  life expectancies  turnover rates  retirement rates  future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates  have a significant impact on plan expenses and obligations 
these assumptions are regularly reviewed and modified when appropriate based on historical experience  current trends and the future outlook 
changes in one or more of the underlying assumptions could result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in any given period 
if actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected 
the inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
retirement  turnover and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
health care cost trend rates are developed based on our actual historical claims experience  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
for our largest plans  discount rates are based upon the construction of a theoretical bond portfolio  adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the future obligations 
a yield curve is developed based on a subset of these high quality fixed income investments those with yields between the th and th percentiles 
the projected cash flows are matched to this yield curve and a present value developed which is then calibrated to develop a single equivalent discount rate 
pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees that satisfy  at a minimum  the applicable funding regulations 
for our largest defined benefit pension plans  expected investment rates of return are based upon input from the plans investment advisors and actuary regarding our expected investment portfolio mix  historical rates of return on those assets  projected future asset class returns  the impact of active management and long term market conditions and inflation expectations 
we believe that the long term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and we regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate 
opeb benefits are funded as they become due 
actuarial gains or losses may result from changes in assumptions or when actual experience is different from that expected 
under the applicable standards  those gains and losses are not required to be immediately recognized in our results of operations as expense  but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and amortized into expense over future periods 
our us defined benefit pension plans comprise of our consolidated defined benefit pension obligations at december  these plans were frozen in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy reorganization in as such  there have been no service related costs since that time  and changes in our net obligations are principally attributable to changing discount rates and the performance of plan assets 
pension obligations are valued using discount rates established annually in consultation with our outside actuarial advisors using a theoretical bond portfolio  adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for our future obligations 
declining discount rates increase the present value of future pension obligations a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our us pension liability by about when establishing expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets  we consider historical performance and forward looking return estimates reflective of our portfolio mix and expected investment strategy 
our investment strategy and portfolio complexion is described in note of the consolidated financial statements in item over the past three years  our actual returns on plan assets have exceeded our expectations 
based on the portion of assets directed to fixed income  immunizing type investments  we will continue to use as our expected return on plan assets assumption for at december   we have approximately of unrecognized losses relating to our us pension plans 
actuarial gains and losses primarily the result of discount rate changes and differences between actual and expected asset returns are deferred in aoci and amortized to expense following the corridor approach 
we use the average remaining service period of active participants unless almost all of the plan s participants are inactive  in which case we use the average remaining life expectancy of inactive participants 
actuarial gains and losses can also impact required cash contributions 
based on the current funded status of our us plans  there are no minimum contribution requirements for we presently plan to make voluntary contributions of in see additional discussion of our pension and opeb obligations in note to our consolidated financial statements in item goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment as of october of each year for all of our reporting units  and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would warrant such a review 
we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the cash flows are estimated over a significant future period of time  which makes those estimates and assumptions subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
we also utilize market valuation models which require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to our assets and businesses 
we use our internal forecasts  which we update quarterly  to make our cash flow projections 
these forecasts are based on our knowledge of our customers production forecasts  our assessment of market growth rates  net new business  material and labor cost estimates  cost recovery agreements with customers and our estimate of savings expected from our restructuring activities 
the most likely factors that would significantly impact our forecasts are changes in customer production levels and loss of significant portions of our business 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates used in the assessment of the goodwill in our off highway reporting unit and our other indefinite lived intangible assets as of october  were reasonable 
there is a significant excess of fair value over the carrying value of these assets at december  long lived assets with definite lives we perform impairment analyses on our property  plant and equipment and our definite lived intangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
when indications are present  we compare the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate to the carrying amounts of such assets 
we utilize the cash flow projections discussed above for property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangibles 
we group the assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the undiscounted future cash flows using the life of the primary assets 
if the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not recoverable from future cash flows and exceed their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amounts of the long lived assets to their fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  third party appraisals or other methods that provide appropriate estimates of value 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred  performing the impairment analysis and estimating the fair value of the assets require numerous assumptions and a considerable amount of management judgment 
we are evaluating strategic opportunities for a portion of our business in argentina having net assets of approximately at december  depending on the ultimate course of action  as determined by management and accepted by the argentina government  an impairment of these assets could be triggered 
warranty costs related to product warranty obligations are estimated and accrued at the time of sale with a charge against cost of sales 
warranty accruals are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate based on occurrences giving rise to potential warranty exposure and associated experience 
warranty accruals and adjustments require significant judgment  including a determination of our involvement in the matter giving rise to the potential warranty issue or claim  our contractual requirements  estimates of units requiring repair and estimates of repair costs 
if actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position and results of operations in future periods could be affected 
contingency reserves we have numerous other loss exposures  such as environmental claims  product liability and asbestos claims  and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regards to risk exposure and ultimate liability based on the information presently known to us 
new information and developments in these matters could materially affect our recorded liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices for products we use in our manufacturing and interest rates 
to reduce our exposure to these risks  we maintain risk management controls to monitor these risks and take appropriate actions to attempt to mitigate such forms of market risks 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our foreign currency exposures are associated with cross currency intercompany loans  intercompany and third party sales and purchase transactions and third party debt 
we use forward contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks associated primarily with a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and purchase transactions and with certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
foreign currency exposures are reviewed monthly and natural offsets are considered prior to entering into forward contracts 
changes in the fair value of forward contracts treated as cash flow hedges are reported in oci 
deferred gains and losses are reclassified to earnings in the same period in which the underlying transactions affect earnings 
changes in the fair value of forward contracts not treated as cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings in the period in which those changes occur 
changes in the fair value of forward contracts associated with product related transactions are recorded in cost of sales  while those associated with non product transactions are recorded in other income  net 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item the following table summarizes the sensitivity of the fair value of our forward contracts at december  to a change in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar 
increase decrease in rates in rates gain loss gain loss foreign currency rate sensitivity forward contracts long us dollars short us dollars commodity price risk we do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk 
our overall strategy is to pass through commodity risk to our customers in our pricing agreements 
a substantial portion of our customer agreements include contractual provisions for the pass through of commodity price movements 
in instances where the risk is not covered contractually  we have generally been able to adjust customer pricing to recover commodity cost increases 
interest rate risk our long term debt portfolio consists mostly of fixed rate instruments 
currently  we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest exposures but may consider such strategies in the future
