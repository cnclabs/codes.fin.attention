item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview we are a leading integrated global manufacturer of engineered structural metal components and assemblies primarily serving automotive original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
we offer our automotive customers a broad product portfolio  supplying body structure stampings  frame and other chassis structures  as well as complex welded assemblies  for small and large cars  crossovers  pickups and sport utility vehicles  or suvs 
our products are manufactured at production facilities strategically located near our customers in north america  south america  europe and asia 
we support our manufacturing operations through eight engineering and sales locations around the world 
our products are offered on a diverse mix of vehicle platforms  reflecting the balanced portfolio approach of our business model and the breadth of our product capabilities 
we supply products to approximately vehicle models globally to of the largest oems based on production volumes 
on december   our subsidiaries tower automotive holdings asia bv and tower automotive international holdings bv together  sellers  entered into a stock purchase agreement agreement with sj holdings  inc  a subsidiary of seco buyer and consummated the divestiture of our korean subsidiary seojin industrial company ltd 
seojin 
pursuant to the agreement  the buyer acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of seojin for a purchase price of fifty billion korean won approximately million usd and assumed the outstanding debt of seojin 
we received of the payment on december  and on january  and  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we expect to receive the remaining in december accordingly  seojin has been presented as a discontinued operation within this annual report in accordance with fasb asc no 
 discontinued operations 
the divestiture of seojin resulted in a gain of million in our consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of factors affecting our industry our business and our revenues are primarily driven by the strength of the global automotive industry  which tends to be cyclical and highly correlated to general global macroeconomic conditions 
the strength of the automotive market dictates the volume of purchases of our products by our oem customers to ultimately satisfy consumer demand 
we manufacture products pursuant to written agreements with each of our oem customers 
however  those agreements do not dictate the volume requirements of our customers  instead  oems monitor their inventory and the inventory levels of their dealers and adjust the volume of their purchases from us based on consumer demand for their products 
during  and  global vehicle production in north america  china  and brazil increased compared to the unprecedented downturn experienced in and however  production volumes in europe decreased in compared to and ihs expects that european production volumes will decrease further in compared to as measured by ihs  global industry production of cars and light trucks was million vehicles in compared to million vehicles in ihs projects production will reach million vehicles by  reflecting recovery to trend volume in the north american and european markets and continued growth in markets such as china and brazil 
we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this trend  but we are not insulated from short term fluctuations in the global automotive industry 
factors affecting our revenues while overall production volumes are largely driven by economic factors outside of our direct control  we believe that the following elements of our business also impact our revenues life cycle of our agreements 
our agreements with oems typically follow one of two patterns 
agreements for new models of vehicles normally cover the lifetime of the platform  often awarded two to three years before these models are marketed to the public 
agreements covering design improvements to existing automobiles have shorter expected life cycles  typically with shorter pre production and development periods 
typically  once a supplier has been designated to supply components for a new platform  an oem will continue to purchase those parts from the designated 
table of contents manufacturer for the life of the program 
for any given agreement  our revenues depend in part upon the life cycle status of the applicable product platform 
overall  our revenues are enhanced to the extent that the products we are assembling and producing are in the peak production periods of their life cycles 
product pricing 
generally  our customers negotiate annual price reductions with us during the term of their contracts 
when negotiated price reductions are expected to be retroactive  we accrue for such amounts as a reduction of revenues as products are shipped 
the extent of our price reductions negatively impacts our revenues 
in unusual circumstances  we have been able to negotiate year over year price increases as well 
steel pricing 
we require significant quantities of steel in the manufacture of our products 
although changing steel prices affect our results  we seek to be neutral with respect to steel pricing over time  with the intention of neither making nor losing money as steel prices fluctuate 
the pricing of our products includes a component for steel which increases as steel prices increase and decreases as steel prices decrease 
depending upon when a steel price change occurs  that change may have a disproportionate effect  within any particular fiscal period  on our revenues 
for our north american customers and several of our other customers  we purchase steel through our customers resale programs  where our customers actually negotiate the cost of steel for us 
in other cases  we procure steel directly from the mills  negotiating our own price and seeking to pass through steel price increases and decreases to our customers 
foreign exchange 
our foreign exchange transaction risk is limited  because we generally purchase and produce products in the same country where we sell to our final customer 
however  the translation of foreign currencies back to the us dollar may have a significant impact on our revenues  results of operations  cash flows  or stockholders equity 
foreign exchange has an unfavorable impact on revenues when the us dollar is relatively strong as compared with foreign currencies and a favorable impact on revenues when the us dollar is relatively weak as compared with foreign currencies 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is the local currency 
assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars using the applicable period end rates of exchange 
results of operations are translated at applicable average rates prevailing throughout the period 
translation gains or losses are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of equity deficit and redeemable preferred units 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions  the amounts of which were not material in any of the periods presented in this annual report  are included in net income loss 
factors affecting our expenses our expenses are driven by the following factors cost of steel 
we utilize steel and various purchased steel products in virtually all of our products 
we refer to the net steel impact as the combination of the change in steel prices that are reflected in the price of our products  the change in the cost to procure steel from the mill  and the change in our recovery of scrap steel which we refer to as offal 
our strategy is to be economically indifferent to steel pricing by having these factors offset each other 
while we strive to achieve a neutral net steel impact  we are not always successful in achieving that goal  in large part due to timing 
depending upon when a steel price change occurs  that change may have a disproportionate effect  within any particular fiscal period  on our product pricing  our steel costs and the results of our sales of scrap steel 
imbalances in any one particular fiscal period may be reversed in a subsequent fiscal period  although we cannot provide assurances as to if or when these reversals will occur 
purchase of steel 
as noted above  we purchase a portion of our steel from our customers through our customers resale programs and a portion of our steel directly from the mills 
whether our customer negotiates the cost of steel for us in a customer resale program or we negotiate the cost of steel with the mills  the price we pay is charged directly to our cost of sales  just as the component of product pricing relating to steel is included within our revenues 

table of contents sale of scrap steel 
we typically sell offal in secondary markets which are influenced by similar market forces 
we generally share our recoveries from sales of offal with our customers either through scrap sharing agreements  in cases where we are on resale programs  or in the product pricing that is negotiated regarding increases and decreases in the steel price in cases where we purchase steel directly from the mills 
in either situation  we may be impacted by the fluctuation in scrap steel prices  either positive or negative  in relation to our various customer agreements 
since scrap steel prices generally increase and decrease as steel prices increase and decrease  our sale of offal may mitigate the severity of steel price increases and limit the benefits we achieve through steel price declines 
recoveries related to sales of offal reduce cost of sales 
adjusted ebitda we use the term adjusted ebitda throughout this annual report 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  restructuring items and other adjustments described in the reconciliations provided in this report 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of performance defined in accordance with us gaap gaap 
we use adjusted ebitda as a supplement to our gaap results in evaluating our business 
adjusted ebitda is included in this report because it is one of the principal factors upon which our management assesses performance 
our chief executive officer measures the performance of our segments on the basis of adjusted ebitda 
as an analytical tool  adjusted ebitda assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it excludes items that we do not believe reflect our core operating performance 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful in evaluating our performance because adjusted ebitda is a commonly used financial metric for measuring and comparing the operating performance of companies in our industry 
we believe that the disclosure of adjusted ebitda offers an additional financial metric that  when coupled with the gaap results and the reconciliation to gaap results  provides a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss as an indicator of our performance  as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity  or as an alternative to any other measure prescribed by gaap 
there are limitations to using non gaap measures such as adjusted ebitda 
although we believe that adjusted ebitda may make an evaluation of our operating performance more consistent because it removes items that do not reflect our core operations  i other companies in our industry may define adjusted ebitda differently than we do and  as a result  it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry  and ii adjusted ebitda excludes certain financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance 
we compensate for these limitations by providing disclosure of the differences between adjusted ebitda and gaap results  including providing a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to gaap results  to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our operating results 
for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure  net income loss  see results of operations below 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of the income generated by our business or discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
our management compensates for these limitations by analyzing both our gaap results and adjusted ebitda 
our segments our management reviews our operating results and makes decisions based upon two reportable segments the americas and international 
for accounting purposes  we have identified four operating segments  which we have aggregated into two reportable segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
through december   our businesses have had similar economic characteristics  including the nature of our products  our margins  our production processes and our customers

gross profit when we analyze our total gross profit  we separately categorize external factors volume  product mix and foreign exchange and all other factors which impact gross profit  which we refer to as other factors

these factors were offset partially by unfavorable pricing and economics million and the non recurrence of a favorable settlement associated with a value added tax audit in brazil million 
total gross profit was positively impacted by a reduction in the depreciation included in cost of sales from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the decrease reflected primarily a portion of our assets becoming fully depreciated in in our international segment and the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies  offset partially by the depreciation at tower defense and aerospace td a that was acquired in april selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a total sg a decreased million or from the year ended december   reflecting primarily lower compensation expense related to the ipo and senior notes offering million  sg a efficiencies million  the costs incurred during the second quarter of related to the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of w industries  which is now td a million  and the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies  offset partially by higher compensation expense associated with stock options and rsus million

restructuring and asset impairment expense total restructuring and asset impairment expense increased million from the year ended december  during  we incurred charges of million which consisted of the recurring costs for maintaining our north american closed plants  severance costs in europe and brazil to reduce fixed costs  and the costs incurred to close two manufacturing facilities and relocate the operations to two of our existing manufacturing facilities in the americas segment 
during  we incurred charges of million in brazil related to improved manufacturing efficiencies  which were offset partially by the favorable adjustment of a liability pertaining to our north american closed facilities 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased million or from the year ended december   reflecting primarily the non recurrence of a favorable settlement relating to the interest associated with a value added tax audit in brazil in million  additional interest on increased borrowings at our foreign locations million  and the higher interest expense associated with our amended abl revolver and new letter of credit facility million 
these factors were offset partially by the lower interest expense on our senior secured notes due to the repurchases made during million and the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
provision for income taxes income tax expense from continuing operations increased million or from the year ended december  the income tax expense increased primarily because of a non cash charge of million for the recording of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in brazil 
this expense was offset partially by a million tax benefit for the favorable conclusion of tax audits in our international segment 

table of contents our analysis for the second quarter of showed that a three year historical cumulative loss existed in brazil 
we looked to near term projections and coupled them with recent historical results to analyze our cumulative income loss position in brazil 
during the second quarter of  the deterioration in short term macroeconomic conditions  which included further declines in production volumes from our key customers  was worse than anticipated  resulting in lower projected earnings in the near term 
based on the guidance in fasb asc no 
 we determined that we were unable to overcome the negative evidence of a three year cumulative operating loss  in light of these deteriorating conditions 
as a result  at june   we could no longer assert it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets in brazil 
if our operations in brazil generate sufficient profitability in the future  the valuation allowance could be reversed in whole or in part in a future period 
our consolidated income tax expense varies each period depending on the level and mix of income and losses generated in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
the actual income tax expense is higher than the expected income tax expense based on statutory rates primarily because we have not recorded tax benefits on net losses incurred in certain jurisdictions 
we have not recorded income tax benefits on current year losses in the us  netherlands and brazil due to the uncertainty of the future realization of the deferred tax assets generated by the losses 
we continually evaluate our net deferred tax asset positions and the necessity of establishing or removing valuation allowances in all jurisdictions 
we record valuation allowances when a history of cumulative losses exists and there is significant uncertainty related to the future realization of the deferred tax assets

in march  we recorded an impairment charge of million on our bergisch gladbach  germany facility which was closed in this charge was recorded to align the book value to fair value less costs to sell when the facility was classified as held for sale 
the additional charges incurred relate to other severance costs and ongoing maintenance of facilities closed as a result of prior actions 
we expect to continue to incur additional restructuring expense in related primarily to previously announced restructuring actions and may engage in new actions if business conditions warrant further actions 
we do not anticipate that any additional expense will be significant with respect to previously announced actions

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million during compared with million during the million change was attributable primarily to increased borrowings to assist in the funding of operations offset partially by the redemption of million of our senior secured notes and million purchase of treasury stock 
working capital we manage our working capital by monitoring key metrics principally associated with inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
excluding the inventory at our discontinued operation  our quarterly average days on hand increased to days during the fourth quarter of  from days during the fourth quarter of our inventory levels decreased from million at december  to million at december   of which million related to the divestiture of our south korean subsidiary 
excluding the inventory from our discontinued operation  the increase in inventory was primarily due to erratic oem production schedules  production of inventory builds to support the transfer of facilities in north america  and the inventory at our new joint venture in xiangtan  china 
we are implementing additional inventory control measures during in an effort to reduce inventory days on hand to lower levels 
we have continued our efforts to match the terms on which we pay our suppliers with the payment terms we receive from our customers in an effort to remain cash flow neutral with respect to our trade payables and receivables 
our accounts receivable balance decreased from million as of december  to million as of december   of which million related to the divestiture of our south korean subsidiary 
the remaining change reflects primarily the decrease of accounts receivable related to customer funded tooling  which resulted from the timing of customer programs 
our accounts payable balance decreased from million as of december  to million as of december   of which million related to the divestiture of our south korean subsidiary 
the remaining change reflects primarily the decrease of accounts payable related to customer funded tooling  which resulted from the timing of customer programs 
on december  and  we had working capital balances of million and million  respectively 
the change in working capital balance is attributable primarily to the divestiture of our south korean operation  which historically had negative working capital 
we actively manage our inventory balances to minimize the inventory on hand which is facilitated by our customers just in time manufacturing process 
we also have a substantial portion of our short term debt that is subject to renewal 
historically  we have been successful in renewing this debt as it becomes due 
our working capital usage is seasonal in nature 
during the first half of the year  production and sales typically increase substantially  which causes our working capital to increase because our accounts receivable and inventory increase 
in the second half of the year  production and sales typically decline as a result of scheduled customer shutdowns  which results in lower sales 
the lower production and sales generally results in a reduction of accounts receivables and inventory which decreases our working capital 
our working capital is also affected by our net position in respect to customer funded tooling with our customers 
tooling costs represent costs incurred by us in the development of new tooling used in the manufacture of our products 
all pre production tooling costs  incurred for tools that we will not own and that will be used in producing products supplied under long term supply agreements  are expensed as incurred unless the supply agreement provides us with the non cancellable right to use the tools or the reimbursement of such costs is contractually guaranteed by the customer 
generally  when the customer awards a contract to us  the customer agrees to reimburse us for certain of our tooling costs 
as the tooling is developed  we experience cash outflows because we bear the costs  and we typically do not receive reimbursement from our customers until the manufacture of the particular program commences 
this timing delay causes our working capital to fluctuate between periods due to the timing of the cash inflows and outflows 
sources and uses of liquidity our available liquidity at december  was approximately million  and consisted of million of cash on hand and unutilized borrowing availability of million and million  respectively  under our us and foreign credit facilities 
a significant portion of our cash balance is located at foreign subsidiaries  including china  and is presently being used to fund growth at those locations 

table of contents periodically  we remit cash from china in the form of dividends  but recently we have not remitted such dividends because the cash is being used in the operations to support growth 
as of december  and  we had available liquidity of approximately million and million  respectively  excluding the cash and availability at our discontinued operation 
as of december   we had short term debt of million  of which million related to debt in brazil  million related to debt in europe  million related to receivables factoring in europe  million related to debt in china  and million of other debt 
the majority of our brazilian debt is subject to renewal 
historically  we have been successful in renewing this debt on an annual basis  but we cannot assure you that this debt will continue to be renewed or  if renewed  that this debt will continue to be renewed under the same terms 
the receivables factoring in europe consists of uncommitted  demand facilities which are subject to termination at the discretion of the banks  although we have not experienced any terminations by the banks at any time since the acquisition 
we believe that we will be able to continue to renew the majority of our brazilian debt and to continue the receivables factoring in europe 
during the fourth quarter of in brazil  we obtained three term loans of million r million with maturity dates ranging from october to september and interest rates ranging from to 
in china  we obtained three additional fixed rate secured lines of credit of million rmb million  of which the entire amount was outstanding 
the credit lines have maturity dates ranging from april to december and interest rates ranging from to free cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap measure that represents net cash provided by continuing operating activities less cash disbursed for purchases of property  plant  and equipment  net 
we believe this metric provides useful information to our investors because management regularly reviews free cash flow as an important indicator of how much cash is generated by our normal business operations  including capital expenditures  and makes decisions based on it 
management also views free cash flow as a measure of cash available to reduce debt and grow the business 
free cash flow is calculated as follows in millions

debt as of december   we had outstanding indebtedness  excluding capital lease obligations  of approximately million  which consisted of the following million indebtedness outstanding under our asset based lending revolving credit facility  million net of a million discount of indebtedness outstanding on our senior secured notes  million of foreign subsidiary indebtedness  and million of indebtedness owed to the detroit investment fund 

table of contents excluding the debt recorded at our discontinued operation  the debt balance as of december  is consistent with the average month end indebtedness levels experienced during the year ended december  our asset based revolving credit facility  which we refer to as our amended abl revolver  provides for a revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of million  subject to a borrowing base limitation 
our amended abl revolver provides for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed million  provided that the total amount of credit inclusive of revolving loans and letters of credit extended under our amended abl revolver is subject to an overall cap  on any date  equal to the lesser of million or the amount of the borrowing base on such date 
the borrowing base is based upon the value of certain of our assets  including certain of our accounts receivable  inventory and property  plant  and equipment  and thus changes from time to time depending on the value of the assets included within the borrowing base 
the administrative agent for this facility causes to be performed an appraisal of the assets other than the accounts receivable included in the calculation of the borrowing base either on an annual basis or  if our availability under the facility is less than the greater of i of the total commitment which is currently million or ii million during any twelve month period  as frequently as on a semi annual basis 
in addition  if certain material defaults under the facility have occurred and are continuing  the administrative agent has the right to perform any such appraisal as often as it deems necessary in its sole discretion 
our administrative agent may make adjustments to our borrowing base pursuant to these appraisals 
these adjustments may negatively impact our ability to obtain revolving loans or support our letters of credit needs under our amended abl revolver 
based on the value of our assets at december   we were entitled to borrow million under our amended abl revolver at december  on that date  we had million of borrowings under the amended abl revolver and no letters of credit outstanding 
thus  we could have borrowed an additional million under the amended abl revolver as of december   calculated as follows in millions

revolver borrowing base borrowings on revolver letters of credit outstanding on revolver availability our amended abl revolver bears interest at a base rate plus a margin or at libor plus a margin 
the applicable margin is determined by reference to the average availability under the amended abl revolver over the preceding three months 
the applicable margins as of december  were and for base rate and libor based borrowings  respectively 
borrowings outstanding under our amended abl revolver may vary significantly from time to time depending on our cash needs at any given time 
our amended abl revolver matures in june our amended abl revolver contains customary covenants applicable to certain of our subsidiaries  including a financial maintenance covenant ratio the fixed charge coverage ratio based on the ratio of consolidated adjusted ebitda to consolidated fixed charges  each as defined in the agreement 
if less than of the total commitment is available under the facility for more than two consecutive days  we are required to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to on a rolling four quarter basis 
if we are required at any time to maintain the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  such requirement will end if more than of the total commitment is available provided that such number cannot be less than million for twenty consecutive days 
our letter of credit facility contains the same fixed charge coverage ratio as set forth in the amended abl revolver as such covenant is only applicable under the letter of credit facility agreement to the same extent  and at the same times  that it is applicable under the amended revolving credit facility agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  we were not required to maintain the fixed charge coverage ratio  thus  were in compliance with our covenants 
our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely impacted by the violation of any of our covenants 
on august   we consummated the sale of million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes the notes due the indenture governing the notes contains a provision that gives each holder of notes the right  upon a change of control  to require the issuers to purchase all or any part of such holder s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount thereof plus 
table of contents accrued and unpaid interest 
we may also redeem some or all of the notes on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the indenture 
on december   we redeemed million of the senior secured notes from a portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering which resulted in a premium paid of million 
on march   we redeemed an additional million of the senior secured notes which resulted in a premium paid of million 
on october  and september   we reduced our outstanding debt by purchasing million and million  respectively  of our senior secured notes in the open market and immediately retired them which resulted in a premium paid of million and million  respectively 
the indenture governing the notes contains customary covenants applicable to our subsidiaries and places some restrictions on tower automotive  llc which became restrictions on tower international  inc after the corporate conversion 
the indenture governing the notes contains certain restrictions on  among other things  our subsidiaries ability to incur debt  incur liens  declare or make distributions to us or our equity holders  repay debt  enter into mergers  acquisitions and other business combinations  engage in asset and equity sales  enter into sale and lease back transactions  enter into restrictive agreements  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
the indenture governing the notes includes customary events of default  including  but not limited to  in respect of payment defaults  breaches of covenants  bankruptcy  material judgments  failure to have perfected liens on substantially all or all the collateral securing the notes  and cross acceleration to material indebtedness 
our other foreign subsidiary indebtedness consists primarily of borrowings in brazil  china  and receivables factoring in europe  which is described above 
our first lien term loan was borrowed in two tranches  a million us dollar denominated tranche and a million euro denominated tranche million at the time of the initial borrowing 
our first lien term loan carried an initial rate of interest equal to per annum plus the applicable us dollar libor or euribor rate 
subsequently  the applicable margin has increased to per annum 
our first lien term loan  scheduled to mature in july  was repaid on august   funded principally by our offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes 
under our first lien term loan agreement  we also had a million letter of credit facility which was owned by funds and accounts managed by cerberus capital management  lp an affiliate of our principal stockholder 
on june   the first lien term loan agreement was terminated 
in connection with the termination  a million deposit was returned to cerberus in their capacity as a deposit lender 
capital and operating leases we maintain capital leases mainly for a manufacturing facility and certain manufacturing equipment 
we have several operating leases  including leases for office and manufacturing facilities and certain equipment  with lease terms expiring between the years and as of december   our total future operating lease payments amounted to million and the present value of minimum lease payments under our capital leases amounted to million 
as of december   we were committed to making lease payments of not less than million on our operating leases and not less than million on our capital leases during capital expenditures in general  we are awarded new automotive business two to three years prior to the launch of a particular program 
during the pre launch period  we typically invest significant resources in the form of capital expenditures for the purchase and installation of the machinery and equipment necessary to manufacture the awarded products 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  the increase reflecting our expansion in china and the timing of program launches 
our capital spending for is expected to be approximately million to million 
off balance sheet obligations our only off balance sheet obligations consist of obligations under our letter of credit facility 
as of december   letters of credit outstanding were million under such facility 
our letter of credit facility initially provided for the issuance of up to million of letters of credit with a sublimit for euro denominated letters of credit with an option to increase the letter of credit facility to

on august   we amended our letter of credit facility agreement to reduce it from million to million 
on january   we amended our letter of credit facility agreement to reduce it from million to million 
on june   we amended our letter of credit facility agreement to reduce it from million to million 
upon a third party drawing on letters of credit issued under the letter of credit facility  we will become obligated to pay to the lenders the amounts so drawn 
the expiration date of the letter of credit facility is june  applicable fees are on the total amount of the facility

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
considerable judgment is often involved in making these determinations 
critical estimates are those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we evaluate these estimates and judgments on a regular basis 
we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
however  the use of different assumptions could result in significantly different results and actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following discussion of accounting estimates is intended to supplement the summary of significant accounting policies presented as note to our consolidated financial statements in item policies that are excluded from the discussion below are deemed to be either immaterial or not critical for the periods presented in this annual report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue once the criteria in fasb asc no 
 revenue recognition  have been met 
these criteria are that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 

table of contents we recognize revenue as our products are shipped to our customers  at which time title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
we participate in certain customers steel resale programs 
under these programs  we purchase steel directly from a customer s designated steel supplier for use in manufacturing products for that customer 
we take delivery and title to such steel and we bear the risk of loss and obsolescence 
we invoice our customers based upon annually negotiated selling prices  which inherently includes a component for steel under these resale programs 
under guidance provided in fasb asc no 
 principal agent considerations  we have substantial risks and rewards of ownership and are acting as a principal 
therefore  for sales where we participate in a customer s steel resale program  revenue is recognized on a gross basis for the entire amount of the sales  including the component for purchases under that customer s steel resale program 
we are generally asked to provide annual price reductions by our customers 
when negotiations are underway and negotiated prices are expected to be retroactive  we accrue for such amounts as a reduction of revenue as products are shipped 
we record adjustments to those accruals in the period in which the pricing is finalized with the customer or if it becomes probable and estimable that pricing negotiated with customers will vary from previous assumptions 
we enter into agreements to produce products for our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle program life 
once we enter into these agreements  fulfillment of the customers purchasing requirements is our obligation for the entire production period of the vehicle programs  which range from three to ten years  and generally we have no provisions to terminate these contracts 
additionally  we monitor the aging of uncollected billings and adjust the accounts receivable allowance on a quarterly basis as necessary  based on our evaluation of the probability of collection 
the adjustments we have made due to the write off of uncollectible amounts have been negligible 
restructuring reserves we have recognized accruals in relation to restructuring reserves  which require the use of estimates and judgment regarding risk  loss exposure and ultimate liability 
reserves for restructuring activities are estimated primarily for activities associated with the discontinuation and consolidation of certain operations of our company 
changes to these assumptions and estimates could materially affect the recorded liabilities and related loss 
fair value measurements fasb asc no 
 fair value measurements  clarifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset  or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price 
the exit price is based on the amount that the holder of the asset or liability would receive or need to pay in an actual transaction or in a hypothetical transaction if an actual transaction does not exist  at the measurement date 
in some circumstances  the entry and exit price may be the same  however  they are conceptually different 
fair value is generally determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
if quoted market prices are not available  we use valuation techniques that place greater reliance on observable inputs and less reliance on unobservable inputs 
in measuring fair value  we may make adjustments for risks and uncertainties  if a market participant would include such an adjustment in its pricing 
fasb asc no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data  referred to as observable inputs  and our assumptions  referred to as unobservable inputs 
determining where an asset or liability falls within that hierarchy depends on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole 
an adjustment to the pricing method used within either level or level inputs could generate a fair value measurement that effectively falls in a lower level in the hierarchy 
the hierarchy consists of three broad levels as follows level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities  level inputs other than level inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level unobservable inputs developed using our estimates and assumptions  which reflect those that market participants would use 

table of contents at december   the carrying value and estimated fair value of our total debt was million and million  respectively 
at december   the carrying value and estimated fair value of our total debt was million and million  respectively 
the majority of our debt at december  and december  is traded in the market and is classified as a level measurement based on the pricing methodology and the limited trading of the securities 
the fair value was determined based on the quoted market values 
the remainder of our debt  primarily consisting of foreign subsidiaries debt  is asset backed and is classified as level as this debt carries variable rates and minimal credit risk  the book value approximates the fair value for this debt 
we have foreign exchange hedges that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the year ended december  and the fair value of the hedges was immaterial for all periods presented 
these derivative financial instruments are recorded in accrued liabilities  and are all classified as level measurements determined using significant other observable inputs 
we engage in foreign exchange hedges to limit exposure on foreign currency related to certain intercompany payments 
these foreign exchange hedges have an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 
the following table provides each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended december  in millions

we evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter based on various factors  and it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter 
however  we expect that changes in classifications between different levels will be rare 
most derivative contracts are not listed on an exchange and require the use of valuation models 
consistent with fasb asc no 
 we attempt to maximize the use of observable market inputs in our models 
when observable inputs are not available  we default to unobservable inputs 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
in accordance with fasb asc no 
 intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires the identification of the reporting units  and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to the respective carrying value 
we define our reporting units as europe  asia  north america  and south america 
the recoverability of goodwill is evaluated at the following reporting units for which goodwill exists europe and south america 
these reporting units exist at a lower level than our reportable segments 
if the carrying value is less than the fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is not performed 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
fasb asc no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually at the same time every year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
the annual impairment test is performed at year end 
we utilize an income approach to estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units 
the income approach is based on projected debt free cash flow which is discounted to the present value using discount factors that 
table of contents consider the timing and risk of cash flows 
we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected long term operating cash flow performance 
this approach also mitigates the impact of cyclical trends that occur in the industry 
fair value is estimated using recent automotive industry and specific platform production volume projections  which are based on internally developed forecasts  as well as commercial  wage and benefit  inflation and discount rate assumptions 
other significant assumptions include terminal value growth rates  terminal value margin rates  future capital expenditures  known restructuring actions  and changes in future working capital requirements 
while there are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management s application of these assumptions to this analysis  we believe that the income approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
however  our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results 
we also use a second approach  which is the market multiple approach  to test the reasonableness of the income approach 
the company s and annual goodwill impairment analysis  completed as of each year end  indicated that the carrying value of the europe and south america reporting units was less than the respective fair values  thus  no impairment existed at either date 
the company also performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis during on the goodwill recorded in the americas segment because the company deemed the recording of a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets in brazil see note to be a triggering event 
the impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the south america reporting unit was less than the fair value  thus  no impairment existed 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
valuation allowances have been recorded where it has been determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the net deferred tax assets 
previously established valuation allowances are reversed into income when there is compelling evidence  typically three or more consecutive years of profit or other positive evidence  that the future tax profitability will be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset 
due to the significant judgment involved in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized  the ultimate resolution of these items may be materially different from the previously estimated outcome 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
fasb asc no 
 income taxes  provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
fasb asc no 
also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with fasb asc no 
and adjust these liabilities when its judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

table of contents pre production tooling tooling costs represent costs incurred by us in the development of new tooling used in the manufacture of our products 
all pre production tooling costs  incurred for tools that we will not own and that will be used in producing products supplied under long term supply agreements  are expensed as incurred unless the supply agreement provides us with the non cancelable right to use the tools or the reimbursement of such costs is contractually guaranteed by the customer 
generally  when the customer awards a contract to us  the customer agrees to reimburse us for certain of our tooling costs 
if estimated costs are expected to be in excess of reimbursement  a loss is recorded in the period when the loss is estimated 
if estimated costs are expected to be less than reimbursement  a gain is recognized over the life of the associated program 
impairment and depreciation of long lived assets our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of a long lived asset group exceeds its undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset group 
the impairment is calculated as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the asset group 
significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long lived assets for impairment cover  among other things  the following program product volumes and remaining production life for parts produced on the assets being reviewed  product pricing over the remaining life of the parts  including an estimate of future customer price reductions which may be negotiated  product cost information  including an assessment of the success of our cost reduction activities  and assessments of future alternative applications of specific long lived assets based on awarded programs 
in december  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our non automotive business 
the charge taken related to the equipment specifically purchased for a contract with a solar customer that failed to materialize  less any salvage value 
in addition  we follow our established accounting policy for estimating useful lives of long lived assets 
this policy is based upon significant judgments and estimates as well as historical experience 
actual future experience with those assets may indicate different useful lives resulting in a significant impact on depreciation expense 
asset retirement obligations fasb asc no 
 asset retirement and environmental obligations  requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated 
an asset retirement obligation is a legal obligation to perform certain activities in connection with retirement  disposal or abandonment of assets 
the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred  generally upon acquisition  construction or development and through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement should be factored into the measurement of the liability 
the liability is measured at discounted fair value and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods 
our asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with renovating  upgrading  and returning leased property to the lessor in accordance with the requirements of the lease 
pension and other postretirement benefits during the fourth quarter of  the company elected to change its policy for recognizing pension actuarial gains and losses 
under the historical accounting policy  net actuarial gains or losses in excess of percent of the greater of the market related value of plan assets or the plan s projected benefit obligation the corridor were recognized over the average remaining service life expectancy of the plan participants 
under the new accounting policy  net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at the date of a measurement event 
the company believes this new 
table of contents policy is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing actuarial gains and losses in excess of the corridor  resulting in more timely reflection of the effects of economic and interest rate conditions on plan obligations and assumptions 
the change has no impact on pension funding or benefits paid to participants 
this change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively  revising all periods presented 
a cumulative increase of accumulated deficit and decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss of million was recognized as of january  related to this change in accounting policy 
the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to our consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates  and expected increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our current assumptions are appropriate based on available information  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension and other postretirement obligations and the future expense 
pension and other postretirement costs are calculated based on a number of actuarial assumptions  most notably the discount rates used in the calculation of our pension benefit obligation for the years ended december   and  respectively  of  and and the discount rates used in the calculation of our postretirement benefit obligations of   and  as of each of our december   and measurement dates  respectively 
the discount rates that we use are developed based on a yield curve analysis from a third party  which calculates the yield to maturity that mirrors the timing and amounts of future anticipated benefit payments 
the expected rate of return on pension plan assets under fasb asc no 
 compensation retirement benefits  of and as of december  and  represents our expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the rate of return assumptions selected by us reflect our estimate of the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested in order to provide for future participant benefits to be paid out over time 
as part of this estimate  we review the existing allocation of invested assets against expectations about future performance of similar asset allocations 
future expectations were obtained from readily available public sources 
expected future returns were adjusted for expectations regarding future investment and other expenses 
based on our assumptions as of december  the measurement date  a change in the discount rate or the expected rate of long term return on pension plan assets assumptions  holding all other assumptions constant  would have the following effect on our pension costs and obligations on an annual basis

impact on obligation increase decrease 
change in discount rate   our pension benefits relate to our plan in the united states  which was frozen in october we incurred expenses of million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively  which includes the actuarial pension losses recorded in the fourth quarter of each period 
the actuarial loss recognized was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
no such loss was recorded for the year ended december  our pension expense is estimated to be approximately million of income  excluding any actuarial gain or loss  and we expect to contribute million to our pension plans in it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mark to market adjustment in  and if one is required  the amount of such 
table of contents an adjustment 
mark to market adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control  including changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 
to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension investments decrease  mark to market charges to operations may be recorded during the fourth quarter of if the actuarial gain or loss is in excess of the corridor 
our other post employment benefit expense is estimated to be approximately million and benefit payments are expected to be million in as of july   future benefit payments on our other postretirement benefit plans were capped at specified amounts and as of december  all such payments had been made

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our purchases of steel  our sales of scrap steel  our ongoing investing and financing activities and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
we have established policies and procedures to govern our management of market risks 
commodity pricing risk steel is the primary raw material that we use 
we purchase a portion of our steel from certain of our customers through various oem resale programs 
the purchases through customer resale programs have buffered the impact of price swings associated with the procurement of steel 
the remainder of our steel purchasing requirements are met through contracts with steel mills 
at times  we may be unable to either avoid increases in steel prices or pass through any price increases to our customers 
we refer to the net steel impact as the combination of the change in steel prices that are reflected in product pricing  the change in the cost to procure steel from the mill  and the change in our recovery of scrap steel  which we refer to as offal 
our strategy is to be economically indifferent to steel pricing by having these factors offset each other 
while we strive to achieve a neutral net steel impact  we are not always successful in achieving that goal  in large part due to timing differences 
depending upon when a steel price change or offal price change occurs  that change may have a disproportionate effect  within any particular fiscal period  on our product pricing  our steel costs and the results of our sales of scrap steel 
net imbalances in any one particular fiscal period may be reversed in a subsequent fiscal period  although we cannot assure you that  or when  these reversals will occur 
over the past several years  we have not experienced a material net impact from these factors 
interest rate risk at december   we had total debt of million net of a million discount  consisting of fixed rate debt of million and floating rate debt of million 
our floating rate debt is primarily held by our international subsidiaries 
assuming no changes in the monthly average variable rate debt levels of million and million excluding the debt at our discontinued operation for the years ended december  and  respectively  we estimate that a hypothetical change of basis points in the libor and alternate base rate interest rates would have impacted interest expense for each of the years ended december  and by million and million  respectively 
a basis point increase in interest rates would not materially impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
foreign exchange risk a significant portion of our revenues is derived from manufacturing operations in europe  asia and south america 
the results of operations and financial condition of our non united states businesses are principally measured in their respective local currency and translated into us dollars 
the effects on us of foreign currency fluctuations in europe  asia and south america are mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currency in which revenues are generated  since we strive to manufacture our products in close proximity to our customers 
nevertheless  the reported income of our foreign subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currencies 

table of contents assets located in our foreign facilities are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each reporting period 
the effect of such translations is reflected as a separate component of consolidated stockholders equity 
as a result  our consolidated stockholders equity will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currencies 
our strategy for managing currency risk relies primarily upon conducting business in a foreign country in that country s currency 
we may  from time to time  also participate in hedging programs intended to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations 
we believe that the effect of a basis point movement in foreign currency rates against the us dollar would not have materially affected our results of operations or cash flows for the years ended december  and however  we believe that the movement in the euro to the us dollar has the potential to materially affect our stockholders equity because we estimated that a hypothetical change of basis points in the euro to the us dollar exchange rate would have impacted stockholders equity by approximately million as of december  we do not believe a basis point movement in other foreign currencies would have a material impact on our stockholders equity 
inflation despite recent declines  we have experienced a continued rise in inflationary pressures impacting certain commodities  such as petroleum based products  resins  yarns  ferrous metals  base metals and certain chemicals 
additionally  because we purchase various types of equipment  raw materials and component parts from our suppliers  we may be adversely affected by their inability to adequately mitigate inflationary  industry  or economic pressures 
the overall condition of our supply base may possibly lead to delivery delays  production issues or delivery of non conforming products by our suppliers in the future 
as such  we continue to monitor our vendor base for the best sources of supply and work with those vendors and customers to attempt to mitigate the impact of the pressures mentioned above
