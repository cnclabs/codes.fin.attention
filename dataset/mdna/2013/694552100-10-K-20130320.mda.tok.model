pacific mercantile bank  et al  filed in january   in the california superior court for the county of orange case no 

this lawsuit was filed by plaintiff asserting that the bank had wrongfully exercised its right to recover borrowings owed by plaintiff to the bank by setting off those borrowings against plaintiff s deposit accounts with the bank 
the plaintiff also asserted certain related claims  including an alleged breach by the bank of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
the case was tried before a jury in august  however i before the case went to the jury for a decision  the trial judge ruled that the bank had wrongfully exercised its set off rights and based on that finding  the jury awarded plaintiff  of compensatory damages  and ii the jury later found that the bank s exercise of its set off rights also constituted a wrongful conversion of plaintiff s funds and awarded the plaintiff  in compensatory damages and  in punitive damages against the bank 
in addition  the trial court entered an award to plaintiff of his attorney s fees and costs  in the amount of  following the entry of the final judgment by the trial court in february  the bank filed an appeal of the trial court s rulings and the jury verdict  asserting that those rulings and the jury s verdict were erroneous and that plaintiff is not entitled  as a matter of law  to an award of either compensatory or punitive damages 
because the appeals process has just begun  it is not possible at this time to predict  with any certainty  how the appellate courts will ultimately rule on our appeal 
however  we believe that the judgment entered by the court against the bank should be overturned on appeal 
other legal actions 
we are subject to legal actions that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
currently there are no such pending legal proceedings that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

table of contents dividend policy and restrictions on the payment of dividends our board of directors has followed the policy of retaining earnings to maintain capital and  thereby  support the growth of the company s banking franchise 
on occasion  the board also considered paying cash dividends out of cash generated in excess of those capital requirements and  in february  the board of directors declared a cash dividend  in the amount of per share of common stock  that was paid on march  the board also authorized share repurchase programs in june and in october  when the board concluded that  at the then prevailing market prices  the company s shares represented an attractive investment opportunity and  therefore  that share repurchases would be a good use of company funds 
however  no shares have been repurchased under these programs since in the first quarter of  the board of directors decided that the prudent course of action  in light of the economic recession  was to preserve cash and earnings to enhance the bank s capital position and to be in a position to take advantage of improved economic and market conditions in the future 
in addition  the frb agreement provides that we may not pay cash dividends to our shareholders without the prior approval of the frbsf and we do not expect to be able to obtain such approval until we significantly reduce our nonperforming assets and generate earnings on a sustainable basis 
as a result  we do not expect to pay cash dividends or make share purchases at least for the foreseeable future 
see item business supervision and regulation pacific mercantile bancorp regulatory action taken by the frbsf and the dfi 
cash dividends from the bank represent the principal source of funds available to the bancorp for paying which it might use to pay cash dividends to shareholders 
therefore  government regulations  including the laws of the state of california  as they pertain to the payment of cash dividends by california state chartered banks  limit the amount of funds that the bank would be permitted to dividend to the bancorp 
as a result  those laws also affect the ability our to pay cash dividends to our shareholders 
in particular  under california law  cash dividends by a california state chartered bank may not exceed  in any calendar year  the lesser of i the sum of its net income for the year and its retained net income from the preceding two years after deducting all dividends paid during the period  or ii the amount of its retained earnings 
moreover  as a california corporation  the company s ability to pay cash dividends is subject to restrictions under the california corporations code 
those restrictions provide that a california corporation may pay a cash dividend a if the amount of the dividend does not exceed the sum of the corporation s retained earnings plus ii the amount  if any  of dividends in arrears on shares which have preferential dividend rights over the rights of shareholders that will be receiving the dividend  or b if  immediately after the dividend is paid  the greater of the book or fair value of the corporation s assets equals or exceeds the sum of i its total liabilities plus ii the liquidation preference of any shares which have a preference upon dissolution over the rights of shareholders receiving the dividend 
additionally  because the payment of cash dividends has the effect of reducing capital  the capital requirements imposed on bank holding companies and commercial banks often operate  as a practical matter  to preclude the payment  or limit the amount of  cash dividends that might otherwise be permitted by california law  and the federal bank regulatory agencies  as part of their supervisory powers  generally require insured banks to adopt dividend policies which limit the payment of cash dividends much more strictly than do applicable state laws 
also  as discussed above  we are prohibited  by the frb agreement  from making interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures we issued in and and  as a result  we have had to defer interest payments on those debentures 
under the terms of those debentures  we may not pay cash dividends on our common stock or preferred stock unless and until we have paid all of the deferred interest in full and thereafter make interest payments on the debentures as and when they become due 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation contractual obligations junior subordinated debentures in item of this report for additional information regarding the junior subordinated debentures 

table of contents the holders of our series b shares and series c shares are entitled to receive dividends payable in cash at a rate of per annum if  as and when declared by the board of directors 
if  however  due to legal or regulatory restrictions  such as the dividend restrictions under california law or under the frb agreement  the company is unable to pay cash dividends on the series b shares or the series c shares for two semi annual dividend periods  then the company is required to pay such dividends in series c shares 
because we were not able to obtain the approval of the frbsf to pay cash dividends on the series b shares in  we issued a total of  series c shares in lieu of those cash dividends in and in the future we will be required to issue additional series c shares as dividends on the series b shares and on all previously issued series c shares until such time as we are able to obtain the approval of the frbsf to pay cash dividends on the series b shares and the series c shares from time to time outstanding 
the issuance of series c shares will be dilutive of the investments which our existing common shareholders have in the company due to the preferential rights that the series c shares have with respect the payment of dividends and the receipt of cash payments that may be made to our shareholders upon a sale or other acquisition of the company 
in addition  no dividends may be declared or paid on shares of the company s common stock unless dividends are first paid either in cash or in shares of series c preferred stock on the shares of series b preferred stock and any shares of series c preferred stock that may have been issued and are then outstanding 
accordingly  we do not expect to pay cash dividends for the forseeable future 
restrictions on inter company transactions section a of the federal reserve act limits the amounts that a bank may loan to its bank holding company to an aggregate of no more than of the bank subsidiary s capital surplus and retained earnings and requires that such loans be secured by specified assets of the bank holding company see business supervision and regulation restrictions on transactions between the bank and the company and its other affiliates 
we do not have any present intention to obtain any borrowings from the bank

background the following discussion presents information about our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report 
our principal operating subsidiary is pacific mercantile bank the bank  which is a california state chartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system 
the bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues  expenses and income and our consolidated assets and liabilities 
accordingly  the following discussion focuses primarily on the bank s results of operations and financial condition 
overview of fiscal operating results the following table sets forth selected financial information comparing our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  to our results of operations in the years ended december  and year ended december  amount amount percent change amount percent change vs

dollars in thousands  except per share data interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income expense after provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss net income loss per share diluted weighted average number of diluted shares set forth below is information regarding the principal factors that led to the changes in our operating results in the year ended december  as compared to pre tax income 
in the year ended december  pre tax income increased by million  or  to nearly million from million in the year ended december  as described in greater detail below  that 
table of contents increase was primarily due to a million  or increase in noninterest income  which more than offset a million  or  increase in noninterest expense in  as compared to net income and income per diluted share 
notwithstanding that increase in pre tax income  net income declined by to approximately million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  that decrease was attributable to a million reduction in income tax benefits to million in from million in income per diluted share of common stock was for  as compared to per diluted share in  due not only to the lower income tax benefits in  but also a increase in the weighted average shares outstanding in  as compared to  due to primarily to our sale  in a private placement  of a total of  shares of our common stock in april at a price of per share in cash 
the increase in pre tax income in was primarily attributable to a combination of factors  the most important of which were the following increase in noninterest income 
in  noninterest income increased by million  or  as compared to  which was primarily attributable to a million  or  increase in mortgage banking revenue and a million  or  increase in net gains from sales of securities held for sale 
the increase in mortgage banking revenue was due primarily to the growth of our wholesale mortgage business which funded  and sold into the secondary mortgage market  residential mortgage loans originated for us by outside mortgage brokers 
as previously reported and for the reasons discussed below  we exited the wholesale mortgage business by ceasing to accept mortgage loan applications from outside brokers effective august   while continuing our direct to consumer retail mortgage business in which we originate mortgage loans directly from consumers 
as a result  we expect to report a significant decline in our mortgage banking revenues in when compared to modest increase in net interest income 
net interest income increased by  or  in due to a nearly million  or  decrease in interest expense that resulted primarily from i decreases in market rates of interest  which led to reductions in the rates of interest we paid on deposits and borrowings  and ii a change in the mix of our deposits to a higher proportion of non interest bearing demand deposits 
that decrease in interest expense more than offset a million  or  decline in interest income  which was primarily attributable to i a million decline in interest earned on securities available for sale and ii an  decline in interest and fee income on loans  primarily reflecting the impact of declines in market rates of interest on the yields we earned on such securities and on our loans in and  to a lesser extent  a decline in the average volume of such securities outstanding during increase in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased by million  or  in  as compared to that increase was primarily attributable to increases of million  million  million  and million in compensation expense  expenses incurred in connection with other real estate owned oreo  mortgage loan related expenses and other operating expenses  respectively  in as compared to the increase in compensation expense was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking personnel employed during  as compared to and  to a much lesser extent  the addition of loan officers primarily for our sba and entertainment industry lending businesses 
increase in provision for loan losses 
the provision we made for loan losses increased by nearly million  or  in  as compared to when we recorded an  reduction in the provision 
that increase was primarily attributable to million of write downs of the carrying values of million of loans to market  upon the transfer of those loans from held for investment to loans held for sale 
since the write downs were charged against the allowance for loan losses  we increased the provision for loan losses to offset those charges to the allowance 
income tax benefit 
in we recorded a non cash income tax benefit of million as a result of a million reduction we made in the valuation allowance that we had established against our deferred tax 
table of contents asset by means of non cash charges to income tax expense in previous years 
by comparison  in we recorded a non cash income tax benefit of million as a result of a million reduction in that same valuation allowance

set forth below are certain key financial performance ratios and other financial data for or at the end of the periods indicated return on average assets return on average shareholders equity ratio of average equity to average assets net interest margin net interest income expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets 
overview of changes in financial condition in decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
we decreased the allowance for loan losses to million  or of loans outstanding at december   from million  or of loans outstanding at december  that decrease was primarily attributable to transfers during of million and million in loans classified as special mention and substandard  respectively  to pass as the borrowers were able to bring their payments current on those loans 
change in mix of deposits to a greater proportion of lower costs deposits 
during  as a percentage of total deposits  the volume of non interest bearing and lower cost deposits increased to and the volume of higher costs certificates of deposits declined to  from and  respectively  at december  the average rate of interest we paid on certificates of deposits in decreased to from in the combination of this change in mix of deposits and this decrease in interest rates contributed to the decline in our interest expense during fiscal increase in shareholder s equity and improvements in capital ratios 
shareholders equity at december  totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million at december  that increase was primarily attributable to the million in net income we earned in and the sale of million of shares of our common stock  at a price of per share  in april to carpenter community bancfund  lp and carpenter community bancfund a  lp the carpenter funds 
as a result  the consolidated book value of our common stock increased to per share at december  from per share at december  due to this increase in shareholder s equity  the ratio of our consolidated total capital to risk weighted assets which is the principal federal regulatory measure of the financial strength of banking institutions increased to at december   from at december  as a result  at december  we continued to exceed the highest of the capital standards that are applicable to bank holding companies under federal banking regulations 
outlook for expected decline in mortgage banking revenues 
as discussed above  effective august  we exited the wholesale residential mortgage business 
as a result  our mortgage banking division is currently engaged in the direct to consumer retail mortgage business in which we originate mortgage loans directly from consumers seeking to refinance existing mortgage loans or finance the purchase of residential real estate 
the decision to exit the wholesale mortgage business was made to enable us i to redeploy some of our capital resources  which had been committed to the wholesale mortgage business  to our core commercial lending business  ii to reduce and control our staffing costs and operating expenses  which had grown significantly to a large extent as a result of the growth of the wholesale mortgage business  and iii to manage and limit interest rate and other risks inherent in a wholesale mortgage business 
accordingly  we have begun to refocus the resources that had been devoted to the wholesale mortgage business to initiatives to grow our commercial lending business and our retail mortgage business 
however  as a result of our exit from wholesale residential mortgage business  we expect that mortgage banking revenue in will be significantly lower than in 
table of contents actions to improve the quality and performance of the bank s loan portfolio and strengthen its financial condition 
in february  we entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell up to million of additional shares of common stock  at a price of per share in cash  to the carpenter funds 
if that sale of shares is consummated  we intend to use the net proceeds to capitalize a new wholly owned asset management subsidiary  which will use those proceeds to fund the purchase of nonperforming loans and oreo from the bank and thereafter manage and dispose of those loans and oreo 
the purpose of these transactions is to significantly reduce the bank s nonperforming assets in order to improve the bank s financial condition and reduce the costs it has been incurring in managing and disposing of those assets in order to improve the bank s results of operation 
if these initiatives prove to be successful  we believe that such success will move the bank closer to a relaxation of some of the regulatory restrictions under which it has been operating since august and which  therefore  could enable us to focus more resources on growing our banking franchise 
the sale of the shares of common stock to the carpenter funds also will strengthen the company s financial condition by increasing its capital and capital ratios 
however  the bank s sale of non performing assets to the company s new asset management subsidiary will not result in changes in or improvements to the company s consolidated financial condition or operating results  because those non performing assets will remain on the company s consolidated balance sheet and the costs of managing and disposing of those assets  and any losses that may be recognized on their sale  will continue to be reflected in the company s consolidated operating results and cash flows until the sales or dispositions of those assets have been completed 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and regulatory accounting practices in the banking industry 
certain of those accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies  because they require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could materially affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions that could impact our ability to fully collect our loans or ultimately realize the carrying value of certain of our other assets 
those estimates and assumptions are made based on current information available to us regarding those economic conditions or trends or other circumstances 
if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other circumstances on which our estimates or assumptions were based  or other unanticipated events were to occur that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates and to reduce the carrying values of the affected assets on our balance sheet  generally by means of charges against income  which could also affect our results of operations in the fiscal periods when those charges are recognized 
our critical accounting policies relate to the determinations of our allowance for loan losses  the fair values of securities available for sale and the realizability  and hence the valuation  of our deferred tax asset 
allowance for loan losses 
like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining an allowance to provide for possible loan losses that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
the accounting policies and practices we follow in determining the sufficiency of that allowance which is commonly referred to as the allowance for loan losses or the all  require us to make judgments and assumptions about economic and market conditions and trends that can affect the ability of our borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations to us 
in making those judgments  we use historical loss factors  adjusted for current economic and market conditions  other economic indicators and applicable bank regulatory guidelines  to determine losses inherent in our loan portfolio and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses 
if unanticipated changes were to occur in those conditions or trends  or the financial condition of borrowers was to deteriorate  actual loan losses could be greater than those that had previously been predicted 
in such events  or if there were changes to the loss factors or regulatory guidelines on which we had based our determinations regarding the sufficiency of the all  it could become necessary for us to increase the all by means of a charge to income referred to in our financial statements as the provision for loan losses 
such an increase would reduce the carrying value of the loans on our balance sheet and the provisions made for loan losses to increase that all would reduce our income in the period when it is determined that the increase was necessary 
during the fourth quarter of  federal bank regulatory agencies adopted new and more stringent guidelines and methodologies for identifying losses in bank loan portfolios and determining the sufficiency of loan loss reserves  as a result of the worsening of the economic recession and the prospects that conditions would not soon improve 
we have been applying those new guidelines and methodologies since the fourth quarter of see the discussion in the subsections entitled provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below in this item 
table of contents fair value of securities available for sale 
under applicable accounting principles  we are required to recognize any unrealized loss on the securities we hold for sale 
an unrealized loss occurs when the fair value of a security held for sale declines below its amortized cost as recorded on our balance sheet 
as a result  we make determinations  on a quarterly basis  of the fair values of the securities held for sale in order to determine if there are any unrealized losses in those securities 
when there is an active market for such a security  the determination of its fair value is based on market prices 
if there is no active trading market  but such securities do trade from time to time  we rely primarily on quotes we obtain from third party vendors and securities brokers to determine the fair values of those securities 
however  quotes are not always available for some securities and  in those instances  we make those fair value determinations on the basis of a variety of industry standard pricing methodologies  such as discounted cash flow analyses  matrix pricing  and option adjusted spread models  as well as fundamental analysis of the creditworthiness of the obligors under those securities 
these methodologies require us to make various assumptions relating to such matters as future prepayment speeds  yield  duration  federal reserve board monetary policies and the supply and demand for the individual securities 
consequently  if changes were to occur in market or other conditions or the circumstances on which our earlier assumptions or judgments were based  it could become necessary for us to reduce the fair values of such securities  which would result in charges to accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our balance sheet 
moreover  if we conclude that reductions in the fair values of any securities are other than temporary  it would be necessary for us to recognize an impairment loss to noninterest income in our statement of operations 
fair value of financial instruments financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and outlines a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date also referred to as an exit price 
fair value measurements are categorized into a three level hierarchy based on the extent to which the measurement relies on observable market inputs in measuring fair value 
level  which is the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy  is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level is based on observable market based inputs  other than quoted prices  in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level  which is the lowest priority in the fair value hierarchy  is based on unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities are classified within this hierarchy in their entirety based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the use of fair value to measure our financial instruments is fundamental to our financial statements and is a critical accounting estimate because a substantial portion of our mortgage banking assets and liabilities are recorded at estimated fair value 
financial instruments classified as level are generally based on unobservable inputs  and the process to determine fair value is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
these assumptions may have a significant effect on our estimates of fair value  and the use of different assumptions  as well as changes in market conditions and interest rates  could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
mortgage loans held for sale we elected to carry our mortgage loans held for sale originated or acquired from the mortgage lending operation at fair value 
fair value is based on quoted market prices  where available  prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics  and purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants 
mortgage servicing rights we elected to carry all of our mortgage servicing rights arising from the mortgage loan origination operation at fair value 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is based upon market prices for similar instruments and a discounted cash flow model 
the valuation model incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating the fair value of servicing 
these assumptions include estimates of prepayment speeds  discount rate  cost to service  escrow account earnings  contractual servicing fee income  prepayment and late fees  among other considerations 
derivative financial instruments we utilize certain derivative instruments in the ordinary course of our business to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
these derivative instruments include forward sales of mortgage backed securities tba mbs and interest rate lock commitments irlcs issued to borrowers in connection with single family mortgage loan originations 
we recognize all derivative instruments at fair value 
the estimated fair value of irlcs are based on underlying loan types with similar characteristics using the tba mbs market  which is actively quoted and easily validated through external sources 
the data inputs used in this valuation include  but are not limited to  loan type  underlying loan amount  note rate  loan program  and expected sale date of the loan  adjusted for current market conditions 
these valuations are adjusted at the loan level to consider the servicing release premium and loan pricing adjustments specific to each loan 
for all irlcs  the base value is then adjusted for the anticipated pull through rate 
the fair value of the forward sales of mortgage backed securities is based on the actively quoted tba mbs market using observable inputs related to characteristics of the underlying mbs stratified by product  coupon and settlement date 
utilization and valuation of deferred income tax benefits 
we record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet an amount equal to the tax credit and tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions tax benefits that we believe will be available to us to offset or reduce income taxes in future periods 
under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations  in most cases such tax benefits will expire  if they cannot be used  within specified periods of time 
accordingly  the ability to fully use our deferred tax asset to reduce income taxes in the future depends on the amount of taxable income that we generate during those time periods 
at least once each year  or more frequently  if circumstances warrant  we make estimates of future taxable income that we believe we are likely to generate during those future periods 
if we conclude  on the basis of those estimates and the amount of the tax benefits available to us  that it is more likely  than not  that we will be able to fully utilize those tax benefits prior to their expiration  we recognize the deferred tax asset in full on our balance sheet 
on the other hand  if we conclude  instead  that it has become more likely  than not  that we will be unable to utilize those tax benefits in full prior to their expiration  then  we would establish  or increase any existing  reserves commonly referred to as a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet to the amount with respect to which we believe it is still more likely  than not  that we will be able to use to offset or reduce taxes in the future 
the establishment of or an increase in that valuation allowance is implemented by recognizing a non cash charge that would have the effect of increasing the provision  or reducing any credit  for income taxes that we would otherwise have recorded in our statements of operations 
the determination of whether and the extent to which we will be able to utilize our deferred tax asset involves significant judgments and assumptions that are subject to period to period changes as a result of changes in tax laws  changes in market or economic conditions that could affect our operating results or variances between our actual operating results and the operating results that we had projected for any such period  as well as other factors 
we conducted an assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax asset as of june  based on that assessment and due  in part  to continued weakness in the economy and financial markets  we concluded that it had become more likely  than not  that we would be unable to utilize our remaining tax benefits comprising our deferred tax asset prior to their expiration 
therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset in the amount of million by means of a million non cash charge to income tax expense in the quarter ended june  the provision for income taxes we recorded in our statement of operations of nearly million for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to that charge 
we conducted another assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of  due to a strengthening of economic conditions  an improvement in the quality of our loan portfolio  as reflected in declines in loan losses and loan delinquencies  and the earnings we generated from operations during based on that assessment  we determined that it had become more likely  than not  that we would be able to use approximately million of the income tax benefits comprising our deferred tax asset to offset or reduce taxes in future years 
as a result we reduced  by a corresponding amount  the valuation allowance that we had established in previous years against our deferred tax asset by recording a non cash income tax benefit for in the amount of million 

table of contents at june  we conducted another assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax asset and due to a continued strengthening of economic conditions  a further improvement in the performance of our loan portfolio  and the earnings we were generating from our operations  we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would be able to use approximately million of the income tax benefits comprising our deferred tax asset to offset or reduce taxes in future years 
as a result  in the second quarter of we reduced the valuation allowance that we had previously established against our deferred tax asset  as a result of which we recognized a non cash tax benefit of million for the year ended december  results of operations net interest income one of the principal determinants of a bank s income is its net interest income  which is the difference between i the interest that a bank earns on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  on the one hand  and ii its interest expense  which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities  on the other hand 
a bank s interest income and interest expense  in turn  are affected by a number of factors  some of which are outside of its control  including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the federal reserve board which affect interest rates  the demand for loans by prospective borrowers  the competition among banks and other lending institutions for loans and deposits and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets  is a banking organization s net interest margin 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  our net interest income increased by  or  to million  from million in fiscal interest income decreased by million  or  to million in from million in that decrease was offset by a million  or  decrease in interest expense  to million in from million in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to further reductions by the federal reserve board in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in the volume of securities held for sale during  which had the effect of reducing the yields that we were able to realize on our interest earning assets to in from in the decrease in interest expense  which had the effect of reducing the average rate of interest that we paid on our interest bearing liabilities to in from in  was attributable primarily to continued reductions in market rates of interest and  to a lesser extent  an increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits and a reduction in time certificates of deposit on which we pay higher rates of interest than on our core deposits 
due to the decline in our interest income in  our net interest margin for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal

table of contents the following table sets forth changes in interest income  including loan fees  and interest paid in each of the years ended december   and and the extent to which those changes were attributable to changes in i the volumes of or in the rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and ii the volumes of or in the rates of interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities

the million decrease in interest income in was primarily attributable to a decline in yields on interest earning assets  which more than offset a million increase in loan volume 
the million decrease in interest paid during was due primarily to reductions in the rates of interest on certificates of deposit and a change in the mix of deposits to a greater proportion of non interest bearing and lower cost core deposits and a lower proportion of higher cost certificates of deposits 
in  the decline of million in interest income was offset by a decrease of million in interest expense as the result of decreases in volume of and declines in rates of interest on both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
provision for loan losses like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining a reserve or allowance for possible loan losses that are an incidental part of the banking business 
when it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced written down to what management believes is its realizable value or  if it is determined that a loan no longer has any realizable value  the carrying value of the loan is written off in its entirety a loan charge off 
loan charge offs and write downs are charged against that allowance the allowance for loan losses or the all 
the amount of the all is adjusted periodically i to replenish the all after it has been reduced due to loan write downs and charge offs  ii to reflect increases in the volume of outstanding loans  and iii to take account of changes in the risk of potential loan losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans or other adverse changes in economic conditions 
see financial condition nonperforming loans and the allowance for loan losses below in this item increases in the all are made through a charge  recorded as an expense in the statement of operations  referred to as the provision for loan losses 
the all is sometimes decreased as a result of reductions in the volume of loans outstanding  a decline in loan charge offs and delinquencies or recoveries of loans previously charged off 
recoveries of loans that were previously charged off are added back to the all and  therefore  have the effect of increasing the all and reducing the amount of the provisions that we might otherwise have had to make to replenish or increase the all 

table of contents we employ economic and loss migration models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines  industry standards and our own historical loan loss experience  as well as a number of more subjective qualitative factors  to determine both the sufficiency of the all and the amount of the provisions that need to be made for potential loan losses 
however  those determinations involve judgments about changes and trends in current economic conditions and other events that can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations to us and a weighting among the quantitative and qualitative factors we consider in determining the sufficiency of the all 
moreover  the duration and anticipated effects of prevailing economic conditions or trends can be uncertain and can be affected by number of risks and circumstances that are outside of our control 
see the discussion above in item a of this report under the caption risk factors we could incur losses on the loans we make and the discussion below in this item under the caption financial condition nonperforming loans and the allowance for loan losses 
if changes in economic or market conditions or unexpected subsequent events were to occur  or if changes were made to bank regulatory guidelines or industry standards that are used to assess the sufficiency of the all  it could become necessary for us to incur additional  and possibly significant  charges to increase the all  which would have the effect of reducing our income or causing us to incur losses 
in addition  the frb and the dfi  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the adequacy of our all 
these agencies may require us to make additional provisions for possible loan losses  over and above the provisions that we have already made  the effect of which would be to reduce our income or increase any losses we might incur 
as of december   we analyzed the all and determined that the credit risks inherent in our loan portfolio had declined during as compared to based on that analysis and those determinations  we reduced the all by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  as a result  the ratio of the all to total loans outstanding exclusive of loans held for sale declined to at december  from at december  the factors that led us to reduce the all included i an improvement in the credit quality of previously classified loans  resulting in net transfers of million of those loans from special mention or substandard to pass  ii a change in the mix of loans comprising our loan portfolio to a higher proportion of apartment  single family and sba loans  which pose lower credit risks than do commercial loans  and iii declines in net loan charge offs to million at december  from million at december  the improvement in the credit quality of the classified loans transferred to pass was primarily attributable to improvements in the financial condition and cash flows of the borrowers which  in turn  enabled them to bring their principal and interest payments current 
in  we reduced the all by million  or  to million at the end of december   compared to million at the end of december   due in part to a reversal of  to the provision for loan losses in our nevertheless  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans  which was at december   remained substantially unchanged at as of december  moreover  that ratio was consistent with the ratios of the bank s peer group  comprised of banks with total assets between million and billion 
the reduction in the all was primarily attributable to i a reduction in loan charge offs to million in from million in  ii a million  or  decline in loan delinquencies to approximately million at december  as compared to approximately million at december   and iii a million  or  reduction in gross loans outstanding to million at december  from million at december

the increase in compensation expense in was primarily attributable to increases in staffing in our mortgage banking division to enable us to take advantage of growth in the demand for residential real estate loans  due largely to declining mortgage interest rates and  to a lesser extent  the hiring of a new president and additional loan officers for our commercial banking division 
compared to in  noninterest expense increased by  or  as compared to the increase was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in compensation expense  due primarily to increased staffing required by the growth of our mortgage banking operations  and provisions of million made to establish a reserve for litigation and other contingencies 
those increases were substantially offset by a million  or  decrease in fdic insurance assessments and a  or  decrease in professional fees  which consisted primarily of legal fees and expenses incurred principally in connection with the collection and foreclosures of non performing loans and loan restructurings 
income tax expense benefit for the year ended december  we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million as compared to million for the same period in  as a result of the release of the remaining valuation allowance  in the amount of million  which had been established against our deferred tax asset by means of charges to the provision for income taxes in prior years 
the decision to release that valuation allowance was based on an assessment which we made in the second quarter of that  due primarily to the improvement in economic conditions  the decline in our nonperforming loans and the taxable earnings we had been generating from operations since the fourth quarter of  it had become more likely  than not  that we would be able to use the income tax benefits comprising our deferred tax asset  in their entirety  to offset or reduce taxes in future periods 
see critical accounting policies utilization and valuation of deferred income tax benefits above for additional information regarding our deferred tax asset and the changes in the valuation allowance established against that asset during the three year period ended december  in  we recorded a non cash income tax benefit of million in as a result of a million reduction in the valuation allowance we had established in prior years against our deferred tax asset 
that reduction in the valuation allowance was based on an assessment we made in the second quarter of that  due to a strengthening of economic conditions  an improvement in the quality of our loan portfolio  as reflected in declines in loan losses and loan delinquencies  and the earnings we were generating from operations  it had become more likely  than not  that we would be able to use approximately million of the income tax benefits comprising our deferred tax asset to offset or reduce taxes in future periods 
in  we recognized a non charge of million to the provision for income taxes in order to increase by million the valuation allowance we had previously established against our deferred tax asset 
that increase was the result of a determination that we made in the second quarter of that  due to the continuing weakness of the economy  uncertainties about the strength of the economic recovery and our continuing losses  it had become more likely  than not  that we would be unable to use the remainder of our deferred tax asset to offset or reduce income taxes in future periods

as a part of our otti assessment process with respect to securities held for sale with unrealized losses  we consider available information about i the performance of the collateral underlying each such security  including credit enhancements  ii historical prepayment speeds  iii delinquency and default rates  iv loss severities  v the age or vintage of the security  and iv rating agency reports on the security 
significant judgments are required with respect to these and other factors in order to make a determination of the future cash flows that can be expected to be generated by the security 

table of contents based on our otti assessment process  we determined that there is one asset backed security in our portfolio of securities held for sale that had become or was impaired as of december  this security is a multi class  cash flow collateralized bond obligation backed by a pool of trust preferred securities issued by different issuers consisting of us depository institutions and insurance companies at the time of the security s issuance in november we purchased million face amount of this security in november at a price of for a total purchase price of  out of a total of million of this security sold by the issuer at the time of issuance 
the security that we own cusip cae is the mezzanine class b piece security with a variable interest rate of month libor basis points  which had a rating of aa aa by moody s and fitch at the time of issuance in as of december  the amortized cost of this security was million with a fair value of  for an unrealized loss of approximately million 
currently  the security has a ca rating from moody s and cc rating from fitch and has experienced million in defaults of total current collateral and million in deferring securities of total current collateral from issuance to december  the security did not pay its scheduled fourth quarter interest payment 
the company is not currently accruing interest on this security 
we estimate that this asset backed security could experience another million in defaults before the issuer would not receive all of the contractual cash flows under this security 
this analysis is based on the following assumptions future default rates of  prepayment rates of until maturity  and recovery of future defaults 
with respect to this security  we have recognized impairment losses to earnings of   and  for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
set forth below is additional information regarding impairment losses that we recognized in earnings for the year ended december  year ended december  in thousands impairment losses on otti securities asset backed security non agency cmo total impairment loss recognized in earnings we have made a determination that the remainder of our available for sale securities with respect to which there were unrealized losses as of december  are not other than temporarily impaired  because we have concluded that we have the ability to continue to hold those securities until their respective fair market values increase above their respective amortized costs or  if necessary  until their respective maturities 
in reaching that conclusion  we considered a number of factors and other information  which included the significance of each such security in terms of i the amount of the unrealized losses attributable to each such security  ii our liquidity position  iii the impact that retention of those securities could have on our capital position and iv the expected future performance of these securities based on the criteria discussed above 
loans held for sale we commenced a new mortgage banking business during the second quarter of to originate  primarily in southern california  and fund residential real estate mortgage loans that qualify for sale into the secondary mortgage market 
our mortgage originations have been primarily for the financing of purchases of residential property and  to a lesser extent  refinancing of existing residential mortgage loans 
in addition to conventional mortgage loans  we offer loan programs for low to moderate income families that qualify for mortgage assistance  such as the fhlb s wish program  homepath financing on fannie mae repossessed homes  and southern california home financing authority and various mortgage assistance programs in counties and cities within our branch network 
as a general rule  most of the residential mortgage loans that we originate are sold in the secondary mortgage market within a period of less than days following their origination 
the following table reflects the activity  in thousands of dollars  of our mortgage loan operations 
year ended december  year ended december  single family mortgage loans funded single family mortgage loans sold loans held for sale lhfs includes million of loans carried at fair value at december  includes million of loans carried at fair value at december  
table of contents loans held for sale lhfs that were originated prior to december  are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market 
effective december  we adopted asu  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
asu and  therefore  we elected to measure lhfs originated on or after december  at fair value 
fair values of lhfs are based on quoted market prices 
gains and losses on lhfs at fair value are  respectively  added to or charged against mortgage banking revenues 
loan origination costs related to lhfs for which we elect the fair value option are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred 
net unrealized losses  if any  on loans carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market would be recognized through a valuation allowance established by a charge to income 
loan origination costs for lhfs carried at the lower of cost or market are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the loans and recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking revenues upon the sale of such loans 
during the first quarter of  we began selling a portion of the mortgage loans we originate directly to secondary market investors on a mandatory commitment basis  agreeing to sell a specified dollar amount of mortgage loans at an agreed upon price within a specified timeframe in order to avail ourselves of more favorable pricing on loan sales to investors 
in order to mitigate interest rate risk on loans subject to such mandatory commitments  when we lock the interest rate for the borrowers on those loans prior to funding  we also lock the price at which we will sell the loans to the investors and enter into a mortgaged backed to be announced tba security 
the mandatory commitment and the tba security act as a hedge against market interest rate movements between the time the interest rate is locked and the loan is funded and sold into the secondary market 
tba securities are deemed to be derivatives and involve off balance sheet financial risk 
the contractual or notional amounts of the tba securities are tied to the bank s loan origination volume and we bear a financial risk from such securities 
as of december   million of loans held for sale were subject to interest rate lock commitments providing a hedge to interest rates and million were subject to expired interest rate locks 
the unrealized fair value gains from the interest rate contracts and tba security hedges were  as of december   and were recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
unrealized gains or losses on these hedges depend upon the value of the underlying financial instruments and are affected by changes in market rates of interest

non performing loans consist of i loans on non accrual status which are loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued  which include restructured loans when there has not been a history of past performance on debt service in accordance with the contractual terms of the restructured loans  and ii loans days or more past due and still accruing interest 
non performing assets are comprised of non performing loans and other real estate owned  or oreo  which consists of real properties which have been acquired by foreclosure or similar means and which we intend to offer for sale 
loans are placed on non accrual status when  in our opinion  the full timely collection of principal or interest is in doubt 
generally  the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest payments become more than days past due  unless we believe the loan is adequately collateralized and the loan is in the process of collection 
however  in certain instances  we may place a particular loan on non accrual status earlier  depending upon the specific circumstances involved in loan s delinquency 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current income 
subsequent collections of unpaid amounts on such a loan are applied to reduce principal when received  except when the ultimate collectability of principal is probable  in which case interest payments are credited to income 
non accrual loans may be restored to accrual status if and when principal and interest become current and full repayment is expected 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis for impaired loans not meeting the criteria for non accrual treatment

table of contents allowance for loan losses 
at december  the allowance for loan losses the all totaled million  as compared to million at december  as a percentage of total loans outstanding  the all at december  was  compared to at december  the adequacy of the all is determined through periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other factors that can reasonably be expected to affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations 
those factors are inherently subjective as the process for determining the adequacy of the all involves some significant estimates and assumptions about such matters such as i economic conditions and trends and the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows of borrowers which can affect their ability to meet their loan obligations to us  ii the fair value of the collateral securing non performing loans  iii estimates of losses that we may incur on non performing loans  which are determined on the basis of historical loss experience and industry loss factors and bank regulatory guidelines  which are subject to change  and iv various qualitative factors 
since those factors are subject to changes in economic and other conditions and changes in regulatory guidelines or other circumstances over which we have no control  the amount of the all may prove to be insufficient to cover all of the loan losses we might incur in the future 
in such an event  it may become necessary for us to increase the all from time to time to maintain its adequacy 
such increases are effectuated by means of a charge to income  referred to as the provision for loan losses  in our statements of our operations 
see results of operations provision for loan losses  above in this item the amount of the all is first determined by assigning reserve ratios for all loans 
all non accrual loans and other loans classified as special mention  substandard or doubtful classified loans or classification categories and not fully collateralized are then assigned specific reserves within the all  with greater reserve allocations made to loans deemed to be of a higher risk 
these ratios are determined based on prior loss history and industry guidelines and loss factors  by type of loan  adjusted for current economic factors and current economic trends 
on a quarterly basis  we utilize a classification migration model and individual loan review analytical tools as starting points for determining the adequacy of the all 
our loss migration analysis tracks a certain number of quarters of loan loss history and industry loss factors to determine historical losses by classification category for each loan type  except certain loans automobile  mortgage and credit cards  which are analyzed as homogeneous loan pools 
these calculated loss factors are then applied to outstanding loan balances 
we also conduct individual loan review analysis  as part of the all allocation process  applying specific monitoring policies and procedures in analyzing the existing loan portfolio 
in determining whether and the extent to which we will make adjustments to our loan loss migration model for purposes of determining the all  we also consider a number of qualitative factors that can affect the performance and the collectability of the loans in our loan portfolio 
such qualitative factors include the effects of changes that we may make in our loan policies or underwriting standards on the quality of the loans and the risks in our loan portfolios  trends and changes in local  regional and national economic conditions  as well as changes in industry specific conditions  and any other reasonably foreseeable events that could affect the performance or the collectability of the loans in our loan portfolios  material changes that may occur in the mix or in the volume of the loans in our loan portfolios that could alter  whether positively or negatively  the risk profile of those portfolios  changes in management or loan personnel or other circumstances that could  either positively or negatively  impact the application of our loan underwriting standards  the monitoring of nonperforming loans or our loan collection efforts  changes in the concentration of risk in the loan portfolio  and external factors that  in addition to economic conditions  can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations  such as fires  earthquakes and terrorist attacks 
determining the effects that these qualitative factors may have on the performance of each category of loans in our loan portfolio requires numerous judgments  assumptions and estimates about conditions  trends and events which may subsequently prove to have been incorrect due to circumstances outside of our control 
moreover  the effects of 
table of contents qualitative factors such as these on the performance of our loan portfolios are often difficult to quantify 
as a result  we may sustain loan losses in any particular period that are sizable in relation to the all or that may even exceed the all 
in response to the economic recession  which resulted in increased and relatively persistent high rates of unemployment  and the credit crisis that has led to a severe tightening in the availability of credit  preventing borrowers from refinancing their loans  we i implemented more stringent loan underwriting standards  ii strengthened loan underwriting and approval processes  and iii added personnel with experience in addressing problem assets

our primary sources of cash include cash we have on deposit at other financial institutions  payments on loans  proceeds from the sale or maturity of securities  and from sales of residential mortgage loans  increases in deposits and increases in borrowings principally from the federal home loan bank 
the primary uses of cash include funding new loans and making advances on existing lines of credit  purchasing investments  including securities available for sale  funding new residential mortgage loans  funding deposit withdrawals and paying operating expenses 
we maintain funds in overnight federal funds and other short term investments to provide for short term liquidity needs 
we also have obtained credit lines from the federal home loan bank and other financial institutions to meet any additional liquidity requirements 
our liquid assets  which included cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  interest earning deposits with financial institutions and unpledged securities available for sale excluding federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock totaled million  which represented of total assets  at december  cash flow provided by used in operating activities

in  financing activities provided net cash of million  consisting primarily of net proceeds of approximately million from a private placement of shares of our common stock in the second quarter of  and a million increase in borrowings  partially offset by a million net decrease in deposits  which resulted primarily from a decision not to renew some time certificates of deposit at their maturity in order to reduce our costs of funds 
ratio of loans to deposits 
the relationship between gross loans and total deposits can provide a useful measure of a bank s liquidity 
since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources  the higher the loan to deposit ratio the less liquid are our assets 
on the other hand  since we realize greater yields on loans than we do on investments  a lower loan to deposit ratio can adversely affect interest 
table of contents income and earnings 
as a result  our goal is to achieve a loan to deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on our assets 
at december   the loan to deposit ratio was  as compared to  at december   primarily as a result of an increase in loan volume in off balance sheet arrangements loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
in order to meet the financing needs of our customers in the normal course of business  we make commitments to extend credit and issue standby commercial letters of credit to or for our customers 
at december  and  we had outstanding commitments to fund loans totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the customer may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit 
we expect  based on historical experience  that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
to varying degrees  commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheets 
our maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customers to whom such commitments are made could potentially be equal to the amount of those commitments 
as a result  before making such a commitment to a customer  we evaluate the customer s creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we would apply if we were approving loans to the customer 
in addition  we often require the customer to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  residential properties and properties under construction 
as a consequence  our exposure to credit and interest rate risk on such commitments is not different in character or amount than risks inherent in the outstanding loans in our loan portfolio 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee a payment obligation of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources  together with available borrowings under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet any increases in demand for loans or in the utilization of outstanding loan commitments or standby letters of credit and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations borrowings 
as of december   we had million of outstanding short term borrowings and million of outstanding long term borrowings that we had obtained from the federal home loan bank 
the following table sets forth the amounts in thousands of dollars of  the interest rates we paid on  and the maturity dates of these federal home loan bank borrowings

by comparison  the highest amount of borrowings outstanding at any month end in consisted of million of borrowings from the federal home loan bank and million of overnight borrowings in the form of securities sold under repurchase agreements 
junior subordinated debentures 
pursuant to rulings of the federal reserve board  bank holding companies were permitted to issue long term subordinated debt instruments that  subject to certain conditions  would qualify as and  therefore  augment capital for regulatory purposes 
at december   we had outstanding approximately million principal amount of year junior subordinated floating rate debentures the debentures  of which million qualified as tier capital for regulatory purposes as of december  see discussion below under the subcaption capital resources regulatory capital requirements applicable to banking institutions 
set forth below is certain information regarding the debentures original issue dates principal amount interest rates maturity dates september  libor plus september october  libor plus october total subject to the receipt of prior regulatory approval  we may redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty  at any time prior to maturity 
as previously reported  since july we have been required to obtain the prior approval of the frbsf to make interest payments on the debentures 
during the months ended december   we were unable to obtain regulatory approvals to pay  and it became necessary for us to defer  quarterly interest payments on the debentures 
we cannot predict when the frbsf will approve our resumption of such interest payments and until such approval can be obtained it will be necessary for us to continue deferring interest payments on the debentures 
since we have the right  under the terms of the debentures  to defer interest payments for up to twenty quarters  the deferrals of interest payments to date have not constituted  and any future deferrals of interest payments through january will not constitute  a default under or with respect to the debentures 
however  if by that date we have not been able to obtain regulatory approval to pay all of the deferred interest payments  we would then be in default under the debentures 
under federal reserve board rulings  the borrowings evidenced by the debentures  which are subordinated to all other borrowings that are outstanding or which we may obtain in the future  are eligible subject to certain dollar limitations to qualify and  at december  and  million of those debentures qualified as tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
investment policy and securities available for sale our investment policy is designed to provide for our liquidity needs and to generate a favorable return on investments without undue interest rate risk  credit risk or asset concentrations 
our investment policy authorizes us to invest in obligations issued or fully guaranteed by the united states government  certain federal agency obligations  time deposits issued by federally insured depository institutions  municipal securities and in federal funds sold  provides that the aggregate weighted average life of us government obligations and federal agency securities exclusive of variable rate securities cannot  without approval by the board of directors  exceed years and municipal obligations cannot exceed years  
table of contents provides that time deposits must be placed with federally insured financial institutions  cannot exceed the current federally insured amount in any one institution  except to secure letter of credits issued for our borrowers  and may not have a maturity exceeding months  unless that time deposit is matched to a liability instrument issued by the bank  and prohibits engaging in securities trading activities 
other contractual obligations set forth below is information regarding our material contractual obligations as of december  operating lease obligations 
we lease certain facilities and equipment under various non cancelable operating leases  which include escalation clauses ranging between and per annum 
future minimum non cancelable lease commitments  in thousands of dollars  were as follows at december  thereafter total maturing time certificates of deposits 
set forth below is a maturity schedule  as of december   of time certificates of deposit of  or more at december  in thousands and beyond total capital resources regulatory capital requirements applicable to banking institutions under federal banking regulations that apply to all united states based bank holding companies and federally insured banks  the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on a stand alone basis must meet specific capital adequacy requirements that  for the most part  involve quantitative measures  primarily in terms of the ratios of their capital to their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items  calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
under those regulations  each bank holding company must meet a minimum capital ratio and each federally insured bank is determined by its primary federal bank regulatory agency to come within one of the following capital adequacy categories on the basis of its capital ratios well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized 
table of contents significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized certain qualitative assessments also are made by a banking institution s primary federal regulatory agency that could lead the agency to determine that the banking institution should be assigned to a lower capital category than the one indicated by the quantitative measures used to assess the institution s capital adequacy 
at each successive lower capital category  a banking institution is subject to greater operating restrictions and increased regulatory supervision by its federal bank regulatory agency 
the following table sets forth the capital and capital ratios of the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on a stand alone basis at december   as compared to the respective regulatory requirements applicable to them 
applicable federal regulatory requirement for capital adequacy purposes to be categorized as well capital amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands total capital to risk weighted assets company   at least n a n a bank   at least  at least tier capital to risk weighted assets company   at least n a n a bank   at least  at least tier capital to average assets company   at least n a n a bank   at least  at least at december  the bank on a stand alone basis continued to qualify as a well capitalized institution  and the company continued to exceed the minimum required capital ratios applicable to it  under the capital adequacy guidelines described above 
the consolidated total capital and tier capital of the company at december  includes an aggregate of million principal amount of junior subordinated debentures that we issued in and we contributed the net proceeds from the sales of the junior subordinated debentures to the bank over the eight year period ended december   thereby providing it with additional cash to fund the growth of its banking operations and  at the same time  to increase its total capital and tier capital 
additional sales of common stock sale of shares of common stock in as previously reported  in order to provide additional capital for our business and maintain capital at levels well in excess of regulatory capital requirements  in april we consummated the sale to the carpenter funds of a total of  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share in cash  generating net proceeds of approximately million  of which we contributed million as additional capital to the bank agreement to sell additional shares of common stock 
as we also have previously reported  in february we entered into a stock purchase agreement which provides for us to sell up to an additional  shares of our common stock  at a purchase price of per share in cash  to the carpenter funds 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of those shares  which are expected to total approximately  to capitalize a new wholly owned asset management subsidiary  which will use those proceeds primarily to fund the purchase of nonperforming loans and oreo from the bank 
this asset management subsidiary will then focus its efforts and resources principally on managing and disposing of those assets 
the sale of those assets by the bank to the asset management subsidiary will significantly reduce the bank s nonperforming assets which  in turn  will result in improvements in the bank s financial condition 
in addition  we expect the sale of those assets will result in improvements in the bank s future operating results because the bank will no longer have to incur the costs of managing and disposing of those assets 
in addition  the proceeds from the sale of those assets will provide the bank with additional financial resources that it plans to use to fund new loans and growth initiatives 

table of contents consummation of this sale of shares remains subject to the satisfaction  by no later than april   of conditions customary for transactions of this nature and the condition that the company and the carpenter funds will have obtained  by no later than may   federal bank regulatory approvals for the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement  including for the purchase by the new asset management subsidiary of nonperforming assets from the bank 
there is no assurance that all of the conditions will be satisfied and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the sale of these shares of common stock to the carpenter funds will be consummated 
this sale of the shares to the carpenter funds also will strengthen the company s financial condition by increasing its consolidated shareholders equity and capital ratios 
however  the bank s sale of non performing assets to the company s new asset management subsidiary will not otherwise result in improvements to the company s consolidated financial condition or consolidated operating results  because those non performing assets will remain on the company s consolidated balance sheet and the costs of managing and disposing of those assets  and any losses that may be recognized on their sale or other disposition  will continue to negatively affect the company s consolidated operating results and cash flows until the sales or dispositions of those assets are completed 
dividend policy and share repurchase programs and restrictions on payment of dividends 
our board of directors has followed the policy of retaining earnings to maintain capital and  thereby  support the operations of the bank 
moreover  the frb agreement prohibits our payment of cash dividends and any repurchases of shares of our common stock  without the prior approval of the frbsf 
in addition  the frb agreement prohibits us from making interest payments on our junior subordinated debentures without the approval of the frbsf 
as described above  we have been unable to obtain those approvals and  consequently  we have had to defer interest payments on those debentures since as a result  we are precluded  by the terms of those debentures  from paying cash dividends on our common stock or preferred stock unless and until we have paid all of the deferred interest in full and thereafter make interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures as and when they become due 
accordingly  we do not expect to pay cash dividends or make share purchases at least for the foreseeable future 
the holders of the series b shares are entitled to receive dividends payable in cash at a rate of per annum if  as and when declared by the board of directors 
if  however  due to legal or regulatory restrictions  the company is unable to pay cash dividends on the series b shares for two semi annual dividend periods  then the company will be required to pay such dividends in shares of series c preferred stock series c shares 
due to the regulatory restrictions that preclude us from paying cash dividends  in we issued a total of  series c shares in lieu of the cash dividends that would otherwise have been payable on the series b shares 
the issuance of series c shares is dilutive of the ownership that our existing shareholders have in the company 
in addition  no dividends may be declared or paid on shares of the company s common stock unless dividends are first paid either in cash or in series c shares on the shares of series b preferred stock and any shares of series c preferred stock that may be issued in the future
