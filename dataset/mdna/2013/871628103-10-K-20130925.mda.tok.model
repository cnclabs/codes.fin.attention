business overview we are a development stage global energy and gasification technology company that provides proprietary gasification technology systems and solutions to the energy and chemical industries 
our business is to create value by supplying our technology  equipment and services into global projects where lower cost low quality coals  coal wastes  municipal wastes  agricultural biomass  and other biomass feedstocks can be profitably converted through our proprietary gasification technology into clean synthesis gas  or syngas a mixture of primarily hydrogen  carbon monoxide  and methane  which is then used to produce a variety of high value energy and chemical products 
our initial operating projects to date convert high ash coal and coal wastes to chemical grade methanol  and we are pursuing a variety of additional global projects under development by customers who may use our technology platform to convert low quality coals such as lignite  coal wastes  municipal wastes and agricultural waste biomass to high value products such as electric power  transportation fuels  substitute natural gas  or sng  fuel for direct reduction iron  or dri  steel making and other products 
our technology is originally based on the u gas process developed by the gas technology institute and we have augmented and differentiated the technology through newly developed intellectual property related to design  detailed engineering  constructing  starting up and operating our two commercial joint venture plants in china 
we intend to commercialize our technology through supplying our gasification systems consisting of technology  equipment and services to projects globally and to accomplish this largely via value accretive partnerships and collaborations with other companies which operate in the energy and chemical market segments where we believe our technology is highly advantaged 
this is a low capital intensity business approach which we believe can generate attractive margins for us through providing our technology differentiated equipment and services in multiple market segments globally with a potential to build meaningful sales opportunities over time 
however  to date our principal operating activities have focused in china where we have invested and built two commercial projects 
we made these investments to fully demonstrate our technology and our capabilities to build and operate  but with this step of commercializing our technology successfully completed  we no longer intend to make such extensive capital investments in the foreseeable future 
our zz joint venture project is our first commercial scale coal gasification plant and is located in shandong province  china 
it achieved commercial operation in december the zz joint venture is designed to produce clean syngas for sale to an immediately adjacent industrial company who manufactures methanol from the syngas 
under the new commercial structure completed in july  we are assuming control of the methanol facilities and the zz joint venture plant will operate as an integrated plant which converts local coal wastes to methanol  as described in more detail under current operations and projects zao zhuang joint venture 
the yima joint venture project in henan province  china generated its first methanol production in december  and is currently in its start up phase  as described in more detail under business current operations and projects yima joint ventures 
it is designed to produce  tons per year of chemical grade methanol and has achieved as high as of its design raw methanol production capacity during start up 
our business model is to deploy our technology on a global basis via supplying a technology package  containing license rights to operate a project using our technology  gasification system equipment  and technology related services 
as part of our overall strategy we intend to form strategic regional and market based partnerships or business verticals where our technology offers advantages and through cooperating with these partners grow an installed base of projects 
through collaborative partnering arrangements we believe we will commercialize our technology much faster than entering these markets alone 
building on our success in china  we are formalizing a china region business unit  that we refer to as ses china  with plans to capitalize this business locally with strategic partners that we believe can help accelerate our growth in china 
in addition to regional business units  we are continuing to evaluate and develop our business in markets such as power  steel  fuels  substitute natural gas  chemicals and renewables which can benefit from deploying our technology offering to create these products from low cost coal and renewable feedstocks 
we are developing these market based business vertical opportunities together with strategic partners which have established businesses or interests in these markets with the goal of growing and expanding these businesses by partnering with us and deployment of our technology offering 
our collaboration with ge packaged power  inc  a subsidiary of ge  which began in early to jointly evaluate and market a small scale power generation unit combining our gasification technology with ge s aeroderivative gas turbines  is an ongoing example of our market based business vertical developments underway 
we are also advancing developments via technology integration studies with potential partners for business verticals in dri steel and green chemicals derived from municipal wastes 
we have also formalized agreements for marketing our technology in india which we believe is an important growth region for which our technology is uniquely well suited 
we believe our existing operating projects in china have clearly demonstrated that we have several advantages which differentiate our technology over other commercially available gasification technologies  such as entrained flow  fixed bed  and moving bed gasification technologies 
the first of these advantages is our ability to use a wide range of feedstocks including low rank  high ash and high moisture coals  which are significantly cheaper than higher grade coals  coal wastes  municipal wastes  agricultural wastes  and other biomass feedstocks to make clean syngas 
our feedstock advantage opens up many of these global resources for use to manufacture energy and chemical products which otherwise could not be done with other currently available commercial gasification technologies 
secondly  our technology s advanced fluidized bed design is extremely tolerant to a wide range changes in feedstock during operation  which allows for flexible fuel purchasing for our customers 
additionally  our technology can use much less water and its simple design leads to the fabrication cost of our equipment and resulting plant costs being lower compared to other commercially available technologies 
we believe these important factors position our technology for future deployment of gasification worldwide because our technology can enable projects to become a lower cost producer of products 
depending on local market needs and fuel sources  our syngas can be used to produce many valuable products including electric power  sng  chemicals such as methanol  dimethyl ether  or dme  and glycol  ammonia for fertilizer production  reducing gas for dri processes  and transportation fuels such as gasoline and diesel 
results of operations we are in our development stage and therefore have had limited operations 
we have sustained net losses of million from november   the date of our inception  to june  year ended june  compared to the year ended june  revenue 
total revenue decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  there were no product sales revenues for the fiscal year due primarily to no capacity fee revenue being received and the suspension of syngas production at the zz joint venture plant in late september product sales were million for the year ended june  and were derived from the sale of syngas and byproducts produced at the zz joint venture plant to xuejiao before the suspension of syngas production at the zz joint venture plant 
since initial start up of the zz joint venture plant  xuejiao has been unable to off take the full volume amount of syngas as required by the initial syngas sales agreement for which the zz joint venture plant s original design was based 
in april  xuejiao stopped paying the contractual capacities fees owed to the zz joint venture plant  and in september  the zz joint venture stopped syngas production until this commercial issue could be remedied 
in march  xuecheng energy advanced approximately million to the zz joint venture 
in september  xuejiao advanced an additional approximately million to the zz joint venture 
under the cooperation agreement agreed to in july  or the zz cooperation agreement  these advances are to be applied to settling the prior payments due under the syngas purchase and sale agreement  therefore we expect to recognized these advances as revenue when the zz cooperation agreement is effective 
for more on the zz cooperation agreement  see business current operations and projects zao zhuang joint venture 
technology licensing and related services revenues decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and resulted primarily from engineering feasibility studies and coal testing services for customers who are actively developing projects and may license and build plants using our technology 
revenues for the year ended june  were primarily attributable to two customers  one of which is a global leader in iron ore processing and steel production who is studying the integration of our technology with their steel production technology  and the other is a project developer studying the use of renewable feedstock combinations for the production of chemicals 
costs of sales and plant operating expenses 
costs of sales and plant operating expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease was due primarily to the suspension of syngas production at the zz joint venture plant in late september general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  fiscal year general and administrative expenses included a million write off of deferred financing costs related to the zjx agreement as defined below under liquidity and capital resources which was terminated on june   and fees of million paid to cve under their consulting agreement which was terminated as of august  fiscal general and administrative expenses included non recurring consulting related costs of million  including a million charge to recognize the loss related to a matter with a consulting firm and fees associated with collecting a payment from xuejiao  and million of fees paid to crystal vision energy  or cve  under their consulting agreement 
recurring general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  professional and consulting fees  travel  and other costs of our corporate  development and administrative functions in houston and shanghai  and project and technical development expenses 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due primarily to expensing the excess of the fair value over the consideration paid for shares of common stock and warrants issued to cve under a unit purchase agreement that closed in february  the expensing of shares and warrants issued in connection with cve s consulting agreement and expensing the estimated fair values of stock options awarded to directors and employees during the period 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and was primarily due to corporate assets such as information systems becoming fully depreciated during fiscal the majority of our depreciation expense relates to our zz joint venture plant s assets which we have continued to depreciate since the plant s operations were suspended in september we expect to continue to depreciate the zz joint venture while we prepare for and operate under the zz cooperation agreement 
equity in losses of joint ventures 
the equity in losses of joint ventures decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and relates to our share of the start up losses incurred by the yima joint ventures and our share of the start up losses incurred by ses resource solutions  ltd  or srs 
the losses of the yima joint ventures related to non capitalizable costs incurred during the design  construction  commissioning and start up phases 
as of june   we changed from the equity method of accounting for our investment in the yima joint ventures to the cost method of accounting because we concluded that we are unable to exercise significant influence over the yima joint ventures 
our conclusion regarding our lack of significant influence is based on our interactions with the yima joint ventures related to the start up and operations and due to various other circumstances including limited participation in operating and financial policymaking processes and our limited ability to influence technological decisions 
under the cost method  we will not record our share of the yima joint ventures net income or losses  but will record dividend income upon receipt of any dividends 
the losses of srs related to development costs including the value of midas contributed services  consulting and travel expenses 
in december  srs suspended its activities due to the unavailability of financing for coal resources  therefore our contributions to srs are expected to be minimal until its activities resume 
foreign currency gain 
foreign currency gains were  for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  the foreign currency gains have resulted from the appreciation of the renminbi yuan relative to the us dollar and are generated on us dollar denominated shareholder loans payable by our chinese operations 
interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to lower cash equivalent investments 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  our interest expense relates primarily to the zz joint venture s loan with industrial and commercial bank of china  or icbc  and the decrease in interest expense is a result of a lower outstanding principal balance due to scheduled repayments of principal 
year ended june  compared to the year ended june  revenue 
total revenue decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  product sales decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were derived from the sale of syngas and byproducts produced at the zz joint venture plant to xuejiao 
the decrease in product sales was due primarily to no capacity fee revenue being received during the year ended june  and the suspension of syngas production at the zz joint venture plant in late september in may  xuejiao notified the zz joint venture plant that it will not continue payment of capacity fees beyond april the plant continued to operate and provide syngas to xuejiao until operations were suspended in late september  and xuejiao paid other contractual obligations such as the energy fees and by product sales due under the contract 
technology licensing and related services revenues decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and were generated from the testing of coal at the zz joint venture plant  and other coal testing  feasibility studies and other technical services provided in association with our technology licensing business 
costs of sales and plant operating expenses 
costs of sales and plant operating expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the decrease was due primarily to the suspension of syngas production at the zz joint venture plant in late september general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase was due primarily to non recurring consulting related costs of million  including a million charge to recognize the loss related to a matter with a consulting firm which was settled in may and fees associated with collecting a payment from xuejiao  offset  in part  by a reduction in expenses of million due principally to decreased compensation and other expenses 
recurring general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  professional and consulting fees  travel  and other costs of our corporate  development and administrative functions in houston and shanghai  and project and technical development expenses 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and related to the expensing of the estimated fair values of awarded stock options and restricted stock 
the decrease was principally due to awarding fewer stock based awards in compared to depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and was primarily related to depreciation of our zz joint venture plant s assets and our corporate information systems assets 
equity in losses of joint ventures 
the equity in losses of joint ventures increased by million to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  and relates to our share of the start up losses incurred by the yima joint ventures and our share of the start up losses incurred by srs 
the losses of the yima joint ventures related to non capitalizable costs incurred during the design  construction and start up phases 
the losses of srs related to development costs including the value of midas contributed services  consulting and travel expenses 
foreign currency gain

interest income 
interest income was  for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to lower cash equivalent investments 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  our interest expense relates primarily to the zz joint venture s outstanding principal balance on its loan with icbc 
liquidity and capital resources we are in our development stage and have financed our operations to date through private placements of our common stock in and and two public offerings  one in november and one in june we have used the proceeds of these offerings primarily for the development of our technology including the investments in the zz joint venture and the yima joint ventures  and to pay other business development and general and administrative expenses 
in addition  we have a loan agreement with icbc which funded certain of the costs of the zz joint venture 
as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital available to us 
during the year ended june   we used million in operating activities compared to million for the year ended june  the increase in cash used in operating activities was due principally to certain general and administrative costs including cash payments of approximately million in fiscal made to cve for their consulting services 
during the years ended june  and  we used million and million  respectively  in investing activities primarily to fund the start up and development of srs 
during the year ended june   we received million of net proceeds from sales of our common stock including approximately million of combined gross proceeds from hongye and zhongmo for the issuance of  shares  and proceeds of  for the issuance of  shares of our common stock and warrants to acquire  shares of our common stock under a unit purchase agreement with cve 
during each of fiscal and  we used million in financing activities for the scheduled semi annual principal payments on the zz joint venture s loan with icbc 
in june  we paid million to gti toward future royalties due to gti for the yima joint ventures project as part of our investment in the yima project 
an additional future royalty payment of approximately million will be due to gti upon full completion of the build of the gasifier systems which we expect to occur by the end of calendar loan agreements on march   the zz joint venture entered into a seven year loan agreement and received million of loan proceeds pursuant to the terms of a fixed asset loan contract with icbc to complete the project financing for the zz joint venture 
key terms of the fixed asset loan contract with icbc are as follows term of the loan is seven years from the commencement date march  of the loan  interest is adjusted annually based upon the standard rate announced each year by the people s bank of china  or pboc  and as of june   the applicable interest rate was and is payable monthly  a principal payment of rmb million approximately million based on current currency exchange rates was paid in september and the final payment of the same amount is due in march  xuejiao is the guarantor of the entire loan  assets of the zz joint venture are pledged as collateral for the loan  covenants include  among other things  prohibiting pre payment without the consent of icbc and permitting icbc to be involved in the review and inspection of the zz joint venture plant  and subject to customary events of default which  should one or more of them occur and be continuing  would permit icbc to declare all amounts owing under the contract to be due and payable immediately 
as of june   the zz joint venture was in compliance with all covenants and obligations under the fixed asset loan contract 
on september   the zz joint venture entered into a one year loan agreement with a local bank and received approximately million of proceeds for costs related to the zz cooperation agreement 
interest on this loan is based on the pboc rate and is initially and payable monthly 
the principal is due at maturity of the loan 
xuejiao provided a guarantee for this loan and the zz joint venture collateralized certain real estate assets 
share purchase agreements unit purchase agreement with cve in february  we entered into and closed a unit purchase agreement with cve under which we received proceeds of  and issued  shares of our common stock and issued warrants to acquire  shares of our common stock 
share purchase agreements with hongye and zhongmo on june   we entered into a share purchase agreement with hongye pursuant to which hongye acquired  shares of our common stock  or the hongye shares  for per share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  and entered into a share purchase agreement with zhongmo pursuant to which zhongmo acquired  shares of our common stock  or the zhongmo shares  for per share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million

also  on october   we received gross proceeds of approximately  from hongye and issued the remaining  of the hongye shares to hongye 
share purchase agreement with zjx on june   we provided notice to china energy industry holdings group co  ltd  or china energy  and zhongjixuan investment management company ltd  or zjx  of the termination of the share purchase agreement among the us  zjx and china energy dated march   as amended on august  and december   or the zjx agreement  as permitted by the terms of the zjx agreement 
no penalties or payments were due as a result of the termination of the zjx agreement  china energy had not paid any of the purchase price and we have not issued any shares to zjx or china energy under the zjx agreement 
we incurred approximately million of legal and other professional fees and costs related to the zjx agreement which were deferred and written off in june consulting agreement with crystal vision energy effective january   we entered into a consulting services agreement  or the cve agreement  with crystal vision energy limited  or cve  pursuant to which cve provided strategic  executive leadership and management services for us and our china business platform 
the cve agreement replaced a prior services agreement that we had in place with cve dated effective april  cve received a monthly services fee of  plus expense reimbursement   of which is payable in cash each month and the remaining  accrues monthly and is payable quarterly in common stock 
cve was also entitled to incentive warrants upon signing 
in connection with fundraising on behalf of us  cve is entitled to a success fee for the total of any investment from a third party subject to certain exclusions for use in china  or directly invested into our china business 
a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of was granted in february and becomes vested and fully exercisable on december  and has a term of five years 
these warrants to cve are referred to as the cve incentive warrants 
in february  we entered into and closed a unit purchase agreement with cve under which we received proceeds of  and issued  shares of its common stock and warrants to acquire  shares of our common stock  or the cve unit purchase warrants 
the cve unit purchase warrants have an exercise price of per share and have a term of years 
as of june   we had issued  shares of our common stock to cve as part of their monthly compensation payable in common stock under the cve agreement 
these shares are valued based upon the volume weighted average share price for the month preceding the month in which services are performed 
on july   we entered into an amendment  or the cve amendment  to the cve agreement between cve and us dated effective january  pursuant to the cve amendment  cve made a  investment in our common stock on august  the shares of our common stock were issued at a price which was equal to of the volume weighted average price of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market over the three months prior to august  the associated warrants shall have an exercise price which is equal to the volume weighted average price of our common stock on the nasdaq over the three months prior to august  the cve agreement was terminated effective as of august  outlook our strategies are focused on the completion of the yima joint venture plant  the restart of the zz joint venture plant  developing our business verticals and finding a partner for ses china 
our business is to create value by supplying our technology  equipment and services into global projects where lower cost low quality coals  coal wastes  municipal wastes  agricultural biomass  and other biomass feedstocks can be profitably converted through our proprietary gasification technology into clean synthesis gas  or syngas a mixture of primarily hydrogen  carbon monoxide  and methane  which is then used to produce a variety of high value energy and chemical products 
our business model is to deploy our technology on a global basis via supplying a technology package  containing license rights to operate a project using our technology  gasification system equipment  and technology related services 
as part of our overall strategy we intend to form strategic regional and market based partnerships or business verticals where our technology offers advantages and through cooperating with these partners grow an installed base of projects 
through collaborative partnering arrangements we believe we will commercialize our technology much faster than entering these markets alone 
this is a low capital intensity business approach which we believe can generate attractive margins for us through providing our technology differentiated equipment and services in multiple market segments globally with a potential to build meaningful sales opportunities over time 
we also believe that our technology business activities will help advance our capabilities and provide opportunities which may allow us to selectively participate as equity partners in such projects in the future 
additionally  we are continuing to improve our technology in ways we believe will enhance our competitive position 
we are pursuing other possible technology licensing opportunities with third parties allowing us to build on our capability demonstrated at the zz joint venture and the yima joint venture 
we are focusing our efforts globally with our partners in countries with large low rank coal resources  but our principal operating activities to date have focused on china and india 
we and ge packaged power  inc  a subsidiary of ge  have agreed to jointly evaluate and market a small scale power generation unit combining our gasification technology with ge s aeroderivative gas turbines 
this application marketing agreement will focus on regions of the world where conversion of non conventional feedstock sources such as lignite and coal wastes into synthesis gas fuel via our technology may be advantaged over conventional gas turbine fuel sources such as natural gas and fuel oil 
together with ge  we have completed a preliminary evaluation of this application of our combined technologies 
under the terms of this agreement  the two businesses on a non exclusive basis will complete the market evaluation and seek initial customers for this small scale power product 
we also recently announced plans to seek deployment our technology as a gas turbine fuel generation package into a standardized plant design in the to mw range 
we believe the power segment offers opportunity over time to provide meaningful sales opportunities for our gasification technology and equipment systems 
we intend to focus on the continued development of this business vertical 
we are working on licensing opportunities and other business arrangements with high profile steel companies who are active in the dri industry 
in addition  we are also developing additional business vertical opportunities to integrate our technology with dri steel making technology for a coal to steel solution and for evaluating projects that can make methanol and derivatives from refuse derived fuels from our technology 
we have completed two paid studies during fiscal with potential partners to assess integrating our technology into these applications and the results of these studies indicated a very cost effective solution with highly efficient integrations 
our goal for these two business verticals is to find strategic partnering to provide a complete technology and equipment package offering 
we intend to focus on developing new opportunities for our proprietary technology whereby we may i integrate our technology package with downstream technologies to provide a fully integrated offering  ii partner with engineering  equipment and technology companies to provide our technology package into an integrated modular product offering  iii provide technology to enable coal resources to be integrated together with our technology where the coal resources may be of little commercial value without our conversion technology  or iv acquire or partner with owners of these coal resources to create more value and opportunity for us through the integration of our technology with the coal resource 
we understand the need to partner in certain markets  and plan to do so with companies that we believe can help us accelerate our business 
for example  we have entered into an agreement with simon india ltd  a subsidiary of zuari global ltd  to exclusively market our technology in india where we believe the market for coal gasification plants is now developing due to large infrastructure growth demands and an increasing need for a variety of basic chemical and energy products 
our partnering approach in some cases is country specific and in some cases is industry or market segment specific 
additionally  where strategic relationships and capital and or financing is available  we may acquire operating assets with potential to generate near term earnings and give us advantages in deploying our technology 
examples of such assets include methanol fuel blending facilities  compressed natural gas fuel operations and operating coal mines 
we are also actively pursuing business verticals in the segments of transportation fuels  steel and fertilizers where our technology is specifically well suited and developing new downstream coal to chemicals and coal to energy projects which may expand our initial focus to include facilities producing sng  mtg  glycol  and power and reducing gas for the steel industry 
ses china is intended to be a stand alone business platform that encompasses all of our current and future business activities and initiatives in china 
don bunnell  our co founder and board member  has recently been rehired as our chief commercial officer and will be leading day to day activities for ses china with a focus on finding a partner for the business 
we believe that ses china will better enable us to grow faster in china than otherwise possible and to better protect our intellectual property and technology in china 
in addition  we expect to work more effectively with our existing partners to efficiently leverage the other business verticals we are developing including clean renewable fuels and power businesses  direct reduction iron for the steel industry  clean coal to chemicals projects  and for longer term value creation  larger scale sng projects utilizing low rank coal resources and biomass 
we are seeking to partner ses china with a financially strong and highly skilled chinese companies which desires to invest into the growth of china s clean energy space and who recognize the opportunity afforded by our technology capability and business model 
we believe partnering a significant portion of ses china can  with the right chinese partner  accelerate the commercialization of our technology on a global basis and will enable to reduce our capital requirements to achieve this acceleration 
we are also actively pursuing new project partners to invest in our ongoing development efforts 
the yima joint venture plant s commissioning is in its final stages and methanol production has been ramped up to as high as of total design capacity and is now selling its methanol product to a local industrial company 
all three of the gasifiers have been operated at various ranges of throughput and pressure 
the current focus is on completing the installations of char removal systems for the syngas production and commissioning of the downstream units that prepare the syngas for methanol production as well as the continued commissioning of the methanol production unit itself 
the plant is designed to produce  tonnes per year of methanol from two operating gasifiers 
there have been a variety of minor construction related shutdowns which are normally seen in the startup of these units  but they have generally not been related to our gasifier systems 
the yima joint venture plant is being closely watched by our potential customers and partners in china and globally  and we expect the yima project to be a major catalyst for securing much of the new business we have been developing 
we believe that the zz joint venture plant has achieved significant success demonstrating our technology as well as our technical and operating capabilities 
we are of the view that by improving financial performance and reducing operating costs at the zz joint venture plant our overall financial performance can be improved 
since initial start up  xuejiao originally owned by hai hua has been unable to off take the full volume amount of syngas as required by the initial syngas sales agreement for which the zz joint venture plant s original design was based and as a result the plant incurred operating losses 
on july   the zz joint venture entered into the zz cooperation agreement with xuejiao  which serves to supersede the existing syngas purchase and sale agreement among the parties dated october  and supplemented previously in the zz cooperation agreement represents the basis for an integrated syngas to methanol operation and resolution of the nonpayment of the contractual capacity fees by xuejiao 
under the terms of the agreement  xuejiao will i provide the zz joint venture with use of their methanol plant for ten years at no cost to the zz joint venture  ii has provided a bank loan guarantee of approximately million for a majority of the financing necessary for the zz joint venture for the retrofit and related costs of the zz joint venture plant  iii waive certain advances previously made to the zz joint venture and iv supply discounted coke oven gas produced by its existing coke ovens to be used in combination with synthesis gas to produce refined methanol from the new zz joint venture integrated syngas methanol operation 
the new integrated operation will be managed by us 
upon successful completion of certain conditions precedent described below  we will terminate and waive our claims to past due capacity fees owed by xuejiao under the existing syngas purchase and sale agreement 
the zz cooperation agreement will take full effect upon the completion of certain conditions precedent including i all necessary consents and approvals being obtained by each of the parties  ii completion of final due diligence on the methanol plant  as well as the scheduled overhaul of the facility as described in more detail in the agreement and the handover to the zz joint venture  and iii execution of the xuejiao financing guarantee and the financial closing of the zz joint venture bank financing for the retrofit which occurred on september  we believe that there is currently a shift in the coal gasification business toward the use of low quality  and therefore low cost  coals for coal to energy and chemicals projects and we believe that china is a good example of this new direction in coal gasification 
according to the international energy outlook from the us energy information administration  china s natural gas consumption is estimated to reach trillion cubic feet in but domestic production of natural gas in china is estimated to be trillion cubic feet in today  coal to sng projects are beginning to progress and the chinese government supports these types of coal to energy projects 
due to this estimated shortfall in natural gas  combined with the current encouragement from the chinese government for these projects  we believe there is potential in china for several of these sng projects which are anticipated to be very large scale as compared to previous coal to chemical projects that have been built in china 
in addition  we believe many of these projects will be located in regions such as inner mongolia where very low cost lignite coals can be made available and are necessary to reduce the production cost of sng 
our technology is well suited for this location due to its ability to process these low quality coals and to meet local requirements for clean production of syngas  without tars and oils produced by other technologies  and very low water usage for the overall process 
in addition  inner mongolia government regulations permit higher quality coals to be made available to those companies that can cleanly gasify the low quality lignite coals 
this creates the potential to sell the high quality coals directly to the market while operating the project on low cost lignite  further enhancing the overall financial performance and value created by the project 
we expect to continue for a period of time to have negative operating cash flows until we are generating sufficient cash flows from our technology  equipment and services business and ses china including our zz joint venture and the yima joint ventures to cover our general and administrative expenses and other operating costs 
we will also limit the development of any further projects until we have assurances that acceptable financing is available to complete the project 
we may pursue the development of selective projects with strong and credible partners or off takers where we believe equity and debt can be raised or where we believe we can attract a financial partner to participate in the project and where the project would utilize our technology  equipment and services 
we currently plan to use our available cash for i general and administrative expenses  ii working capital  iii debt service for the zz joint venture  iv payments to gti due under our licensing agreements including the million royalty due for the yima joint ventures license  and v general corporate purposes 
the actual allocation and timing of these expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including changes in our strategic relationships  commodity prices and industry conditions  and other factors that we cannot currently predict 
in particular  any future decrease in economic activity in china or in other regions of the world in which we may in the future do business could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
operating cash flows from our joint venture operating projects can be positively or negatively impacted by changes in coal and methanol prices 
these are commodities where market pricing can be cyclical in nature 
we do not currently have all of the financial and human resources to fully develop and execute on all of our other business opportunities  however  we intend to finance our development through paid services  technology access fees  equity financings and by securing financial and strategic partners focused on development of these opportunities 
we can make no assurances that our business operations will provide us with sufficient cash flows to continue our operations 
we will need to raise additional capital through equity and debt financing for any new ventures that are developed  to support our existing projects and possible expansions thereof and for our corporate general and administrative expenses 
as a result of our focus on financing activities  particularly in china  we have identified strategic parties that have expressed interest in helping us grow ses china s business and we are evaluating these options 
we are considering a full range of financing options in order to create the most value in the context of the increasing interest we are seeing in our technology 
we cannot provide any assurance that any financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
any such financing could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to  among other things  i maintain our general and administrative expenses at current levels including retention of key personnel and consultants  ii successfully develop our licensing and related service businesses  iii negotiate and enter into new gasification plant development contracts and licensing agreements  iv make additional capital contributions to our joint ventures  v fund certain obligations as they become due  and vi respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements 
on august   we received a letter from nasdaq informing us that the closing bid price of its common stock has been below per share for a period of consecutive trading days  which is outside the requirements of nasdaq for continued listing 
under nasdaq listing rule c a  we have a grace period of calendar days  or until january   in which to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule 
to regain compliance  the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this grace period 
if we do not regain compliance before january   we may be eligible for an additional grace period if we meet the initial listing standards  with the exception of bid price  for the nasdaq capital market  and we successfully apply for a transfer of our securities to that market 
such a transfer would provide us with an additional calendar day period to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires our management to make certain estimates and assumptions which are inherently imprecise and may differ significantly from actual results achieved 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies due to the significance  subjectivity and judgment involved in determining our estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements on an ongoing basis utilizing historic experience  anticipated future events or trends and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the resulting effects of changes in our estimates are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the period in which the facts and circumstances that give rise to the change in estimate become known 
we believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sales of products  which has included the capacity fee and energy fee earned at the zz joint venture plant and is expected to include sale of methanol under the zz cooperation agreement  and sales of equipment are recognized when the following elements are satisfied i there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  ii there is persuasive evidence that an agreement exists  iii delivery has occurred  iv the sales price is fixed or determinable  and v collectability is reasonably assured 
technology licensing revenue is typically received over the course of a project s development as milestones are met 
we may receive upfront licensing fee payments when a license agreement is entered into 
typically  the majority of a license fee is due once project financing and equipment installation occur 
we recognize license fees as revenue when the license fees become due and payable under the license agreement  subject to the deferral of the amount of the performance guarantee 
fees earned for engineering services  such as services that relate to integrating our technology to a customer s project  are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
impairment evaluation of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  construction in progress  equity method investments and specifically identified intangibles  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when we believe an impairment condition may have occurred  we are required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with a long lived asset or group of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for long lived assets that are expected to be held and used 
we evaluate our operating plants as a whole 
production equipment at each plant is not evaluated for impairment separately  as it is integral to the assumed future operations of the plant 
all construction and development projects are reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of potential reduction in fair value 
if it is determined that it is no longer probable that the projects will be completed and all capitalized costs recovered through future operations  the carrying values of the projects would be written down to the recoverable value 
if we determine that the undiscounted cash flows from an asset to be held and used are less than the carrying amount of the asset  or if we have classified an asset as held for sale  we estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment charge 
the following summarizes some of the most significant estimates and assumptions used in evaluating if we have an impairment charge 
undiscounted expected future cash flows 
in order to estimate future cash flows  we consider historical cash flows and changes in the market environment and other factors that may affect future cash flows 
to the extent applicable  the assumptions we use are consistent with forecasts that we are otherwise required to make for example  in preparing our other earnings forecasts 
the use of this method involves inherent uncertainty 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors  including forward price curves for energy  feedstock costs  and other operating costs 
however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
fair value 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
we will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment 
we may also consider prices of similar assets  consult with brokers  or employ other valuation techniques 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations  however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
the evaluation and measurement of impairments for investments such as our equity investment in the yima joint ventures involve the same uncertainties as described for long lived assets that we own directly 
similarly  our estimates that we make with respect to our equity and cost method investments are subjective  and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material 
zz joint venture plant impairment analysis due to the continued shut down of the plant and new economic and financial assumptions based on the negotiations of the zz cooperation agreement  we believed an impairment assessment of the zz joint venture plant was warranted as of march  we performed an analysis of the zz joint venture plant and determined that these assets were not impaired based upon management s estimated cash flow projections for the plant 
such estimated cash flow projections included a case based on the completion of the negotiations between us and xuejiao to restructure the current business arrangement to create an integrated syngas to methanol operation 
this restructuring would include a combination of technical improvements being made to xuejiao s methanol unit allowing for increased syngas off take and other repairs and improvements being made to the plant enabling more efficient joint production of methanol for a five year period 
after this period  this case assumes that an additional downstream facility to produce a higher value product such as glycol is developed with the additional capital investment made by a strategic partner and that we retain a minority interest in the combined project 
an alternative case assumed the same five year period of the same integrated syngas to methanol operation as the prior case but that the zz joint venture plant s assets are sold after the five year period 
if we are not successful in finalizing effectiveness of the zz cooperation agreement or otherwise improving the zz joint venture s profitability  or if management s estimated cash flow projections for these assets decrease  the zz joint venture plant could become impaired which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
as no significant changes occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal  an updated impairment assessment was not necessary as of june  accounting for variable interest entities and financial statement consolidation criteria the joint ventures which we enter into may be considered variable interest entities  or vies 
we consolidate all vies where we are the primary beneficiary 
this determination is made at the inception of our involvement with the vie 
we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors and form a conclusion that we  or another interest holder  absorb a majority of the entity s risk for expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s potential for expected residual returns  or both 
we do not consolidate vies where we are not the primary beneficiary 
we account for these unconsolidated vies under the equity method or cost method of accounting and include our net investment in investments on our consolidated balance sheets 
our equity interest in the net income or loss from our unconsolidated vies under the equity method of accounting is recorded in non operating income expense on a net basis on our consolidated statement of operations 
we have determined that the zz joint venture is a vie and that we are the primary beneficiary 
we have determined that the yima joint ventures are vies and that yima is the primary beneficiary since yima has a ownership interest in the yima joint ventures 
we have determined that srs is a vie and that we are not the primary beneficiary since we and midas each have a ownership interest in srs and the control  risks and benefits of srs are shared equally 
we have determined that the gc joint venture is a vie and that we are the primary beneficiary since we have a ownership interest in the gc joint venture and since there are no qualitative factors that would preclude us from being deemed the primary beneficiary 
off balance sheet arrangements in october  we amended and extended the lease agreement for our corporate offices in houston  texas which now expires on june  in addition  we have a short term lease arrangement for our administrative offices in shanghai 
contractual obligations our material contractual obligations at june  were as follows in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years zz joint venture icbc loan  including interest operating leases total recently issued accounting standards in july the fasb issued asu intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment topic which is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  this update is intended to reduce cost and complexity by providing an entity with the option to make a qualitative assessment about the likelihood that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance allows an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   however the provision of the new guidance which requires reclassifications out of comprehensive income be shown separately in the financial statements was deferred to allow the fasb to reconsider alternatives 
we adopted these new presentation requirements as of july  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk qualitative disclosure about market risk 
we are exposed to certain qualitative market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices that could impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these risks through regular operating and financing activities  and may  in the future  use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments to date 
foreign currency risk we conduct operations in china and our functional currency in china is the renminbi yuan 
our financial statements are expressed in us dollars and will be negatively affected if foreign currencies  such as the renminbi yuan  depreciate relative to the us dollar 
in addition  our currency exchange losses may be magnified by exchange control regulations in china or other countries that restrict our ability to convert into us dollars 
the people s bank of china  the monetary authority in china  sets the spot rate of the renminbi yuan  and may also use a variety of techniques  such as intervention by its central bank or imposition of regulatory controls or taxes  to affect the exchange rate relative to the us dollar 
in the future  the chinese government may also issue a new currency to replace its existing currency or alter the exchange rate or relative exchange characteristics by devaluation or revaluation of the renminbi yuan in ways that may be adverse to our interests 
commodity price risk our business plan is to purchase coal and other consumables from suppliers and to sell commodities  such as syngas  methanol and other products 
coal is the largest component of our costs of product sales and in order to mitigate coal price fluctuation risk for future projects  we expect to enter into long term contracts for coal supply or to acquire coal assets 
for the sale of commodities from our projects  fixed price contracts will not be available to us in certain markets  such as china  which will require us to purchase some portion of our coal and other consumable needs  or sell some portion of our production  into spot commodity markets or under short term supply agreements 
hedging transactions may be available to reduce our exposure to these commodity price risks  but availability may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge this exposure at all 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our zz joint venture loans 
interest under this loans is adjusted annually based upon the standard rate announced each year by the people s bank of china 
as of june   the applicable interest rate on the icbc loan was 
we could also be exposed to the risk of rising interest rates through our future borrowing activities 
this is an inherent risk as borrowings mature and are renewed at then current market rates 
the extent of this risk as to our icbc loan  or any future borrowings  is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates 
customer credit risk when our projects  including the zz joint venture plant s methanol production  progress to commercial operation  we will be exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
to manage customer credit risk  we intend to monitor credit ratings of customers and seek to minimize exposure to any one customer where other customers are readily available
