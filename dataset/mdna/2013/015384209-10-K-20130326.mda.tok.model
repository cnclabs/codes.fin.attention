item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on the research  development and commercialization of novel proprietary products for the acute treatment of central nervous system conditions 
adasuve  or adasuve or staccato loxapine  and our product candidates are based on our proprietary technology  the staccato system  or the staccato system 
the staccato system vaporizes an excipient free drug to form a condensation aerosol that  when inhaled  allows for rapid systemic drug delivery 
because of the particle size of the aerosol  the drug is quickly absorbed through the deep lung into the bloodstream  providing speed of therapeutic onset that is comparable to intravenous  or iv  administration but with greater ease  patient comfort and convenience 
our lead program  staccato loxapine  has been developed for the treatment of agitation and is known commercially as adasuve 
adasuve has been approved for marketing in the united states by the us food and drug administration  or fda  and in the european union  or eu  by the european commission  or ec 
in the united states and the eu  adasuve has been approved for similar indications  and is commercially available with a different number of dose strengths  and has different risk mitigation and management plans in the us and the eu 
adasuve is our only approved product 
we are projecting adasuve to be launched in both the us and the eu during the third quarter of we are continuing to develop our us commercial launch plans  which could include us commercializing adasuve with a contract sales organization  or cso  or licensing the us commercialization rights to a third party 
for the eu market  adasuve will be launched by grupo ferrer internacional sa  or ferrer  which is our exclusive commercial partner for adasuve in europe  latin america  russia and the commonwealth of independent states countries  or the ferrer territories 
we continue to seek additional strategic partnerships to commercialize adasuve in the territories outside of the ferrer territories 
our product candidate in active development is az staccato alprazolam which is being developed for the treatment of acute repetitive seizures 
our development pipeline not in active development during includes i az staccato zaleplon for the treatment of insomnia in patients who have difficulties falling asleep  including patients who awake in the middle of the night and have difficulty falling back asleep  ii az staccato loxapine  low dose for the treatment of patients suffering from acute migraine headaches  iii az staccato fentanyl for the treatment of patients with acute pain  including patients with breakthrough cancer pain and postoperative patients with acute pain episodes and iv staccato nicotine which is designed to help smokers quit by addressing both the chemical and behavioral components of nicotine addiction by delivering nicotine replacement via inhalation 
staccato nicotine is licensed to ramius value and opportunity advisors llc  royalty pharma  us partner  lp  royalty pharma us partners  lp  and rp investment corporation  or collectively  royalty pharma 
we have retained all rights to adasuve  our product candidates and the staccato system  other than those licensed to ferrer and royalty pharma 
we intend to capitalize on our internal resources to develop certain product candidates and to identify routes to utilize external resources to develop and commercialize other product candidates 
we believe that  based on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance at december  and our current expected cash usage  we have sufficient capital resources to meet our anticipated cash 
table of contents needs  into the second quarter of we are unable to assert that our financial position is sufficient to fund operations beyond that date  and as a result  there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on acceptable terms  or at all  to commercialize adasuve or continue development of our other product candidates or to continue operations and we may not be able to execute any strategic transaction 
commercialization strategy united states in december  the fda approved our new drug application  or nda  for staccato loxapine  as adasuve loxapine inhalation powder mg for the acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar i disorder in adults 
we are projecting that adasuve will be launched in the united states during the third quarter of we are continuing to develop our us commercial plans  which could include us commercializing adasuve with a cso or licensing the us commercialization rights to a third party 
we have not entered into any definitive agreements with any cso or licensees  and this  coupled with our need to finance the us launch  limits our ability to make preparations for the expected product launch in the us this could jeopardize our expected us launch timing 
we initiated several pre commercialization activities in late and early  focusing on activities that had long lead times and are important to the adasuve us commercial launch 
included in these activities are i qualitative and quantitative pricing studies  ii market segmentation and targeting analyses  iii adasuve product position and testing with physicians and nurses  iv a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems program planning  and v the phase clinical studies planning 
as a result of our market segmentation work  we project that the initial launch effort will focus on   hospitals  of which we have identified approximately hospitals as the primary target hospitals 
as a condition of the approval of adasuve in the us  a rems program including an elements to assure safe use is required to be implemented and periodically assessed 
adasuve will only be available in healthcare facilities hospitals enrolled in the adasuve rems program 
we anticipate utilizing a third party vendor or a corporate partner to implement and periodically assess the adasuve rems program 
as an additional condition of us adasuve approval  there are several additional post approval commitments and requirements  including a  patient observational clinical trial  that is designed to gather patient safety data based on the real world use of adasuve in the hospital setting and a clinical program designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adasuve in agitated adolescent patients 
the data derived from any post approval study or trial could result in additional restrictions on the commercialization of adasuve through changes to the approved adasuve label  a rems  the imposition of additional post approval studies or trials  or even the withdrawal of the approval of adasuve from the market 
we expect to initiate the observational clinical trial in the second quarter of and the clinical program for adolescent patients in the second half of commercialization strategy european union and additional ferrer territory countries in february  the ec granted marketing authorization for adasuve staccato loxapine 
in the eu  adasuve  mg and mg inhalation powder loxapine  pre dispensed  is authorized for the rapid control of mild to moderate agitation in adult patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder 
the adasuve marketing authorization requires that patients receive regular treatment immediately after control of acute agitation symptoms  and that adasuve is administered only in a hospital setting under the supervision of a healthcare professional 
the adasuve marketing authorization also requires that a short acting beta agonist bronchodilator treatment be available for treatment of possible severe respiratory side effects bronchospasm 
the ec delivered the marketing authorization for adasuve on the basis of the positive opinion issued by the european medicines agency  or ema  in december and is valid in all of the eu member states  plus iceland  liechtenstein and norway 
as a condition of the adasuve marketing authorization  we have several post approval commitments including  i a benzodiazepine interaction study  ii a controlled study to determine adasuve s effect on cardiac rhythms  or a thorough qtc study  with two doses of adasuve  iii an observational clinical trial  and iv a drug utilization clinical trial 

table of contents in october  we entered into a commercial partnership with ferrer pursuant to a collaboration  license and supply agreement  or the ferrer agreement  to commercialize adasuve in the ferrer territories 
under the terms of the ferrer agreement  in january we received an upfront cash payment of million  million of which was paid to the former stockholders of symphony allegro  inc we are eligible to receive additional milestone payments contingent on individual country commercial sales initiation and cumulative net sales targets 
ferrer has the exclusive rights to commercialize adasuve in the ferrer territories 
we will supply adasuve to ferrer for all of its commercial sales  and will receive a specified per unit transfer price 
alexza was responsible for gaining initial eu approval for adasuve and is responsible for specific post approval commitments following eu approval 
ferrer is responsible for satisfying all other regulatory and pricing reimbursement requirements to market and sell adasuve in the eu countries and the non eu countries of the ferrer territories 
we expect the registration dossiers for the non eu countries in the ferrer territories will be submitted before the end of the ferrer agreement continues in effect on a country by country basis until the later of the last to expire patent covering adasuve in such country or years after first commercial sale 
the ferrer agreement is subject to earlier termination in the event the parties mutually agree  by either party in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party or upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of either party 
in march  we entered into an amendment to the ferrer agreement whereby the eu marketing authorization milestone payment was eliminated in exchange for ferrer s purchase of million of our common stock 
ferrer purchased  shares of our common stock for per share in march commercialization strategy other territories we continue to seek additional strategic partnerships to commercialize adasuve in the territories outside of the ferrer territories 
financing update in may we entered into a loan and security agreement  or loan agreement with hercules technology growth capital  inc  or hercules 
under the terms of the loan agreement  we borrowed  at an interest rate of the higher of i or ii plus the prime rate as reported in the wall street journal  with a maximum interest rate of  and issued to hercules a secured term promissory note evidencing the loan 
we made interest only payments through february  following which the loan was being repaid in equal monthly installments 
in conjunction with the loan agreement  we issued to hercules a five year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the warrant is fully exercisable  expires in may and remains outstanding 
on july   we entered into a committed equity line of credit with azimuth opportunity  lp  or azimuth  pursuant to which we were granted the ability to sell up to million of our common stock over an approximately month period pursuant to the terms of a common stock purchase agreement  or the purchase agreement 
we will determine  at our sole discretion  the timing  the dollar amount and the price per share of each draw under this facility  subject to certain conditions 
when we elect to utilize the facility by delivery of a draw down notice to azimuth  we will issue shares to azimuth at a discount of to the volume weighted average price of our common stock over a preceding period of trading days  or a draw down period 
the purchase agreement also provides that from time to time  at our sole discretion  we may grant azimuth an option to purchase additional shares of our common stock during each draw down period for an amount of shares specified by us based on the trading price of our common stock 
upon azimuth s exercise of such an option  we will sell to azimuth the shares subject to the option at a price equal to the greater of i the daily volume weighted average price of the company s common stock on the day azimuth notifies the company of its election to exercise its option or ii the threshold price for the option determined by the company  in each case less a discount of 
in addition to the foregoing amounts  in consideration for azimuth s execution and delivery of the purchase agreement  we issued to azimuth  shares of our common stock on july  in  we utilized million of the facility  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
we are not obligated to utilize any 
table of contents further portion of the facility  but may do so from time to time at our discretion 
this facility replaces a similar facility that was established in may and expired after its month term 
azimuth is not required to purchase any shares at a pre discounted purchase price below per share  and any additional shares sold under this facility will be sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  on july  the purchase agreement will terminate on august  on february   we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million  after deducting offering expenses 
the warrants are exercisable beginning february  at per share and will expire on february  the shares of common stock and warrants were sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement declared effective by the sec on may  we agreed to customary obligations  including indemnification 
other than those licensed to i ferrer for adasuve and ii ramius value and opportunity advisors llc  royalty pharma  us partner  lp  royalty pharma us partners  lp  and rp investment corporation  or collectively  or royalty pharma  for our staccato nicotine product candidate  we have retained all rights to our product candidates and the staccato system 
we intend to capitalize on our internal resources to develop certain product candidates and to identify routes to utilize external resources to develop and commercialize other product candidates 
we were incorporated december  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  equipment financings  debt financings and government grants 
we have generated million in revenues from inception through december   primarily through license and development agreements and to a lesser extent united states small business innovation research grants and drug compound feasibility studies 
prior to  we recognized governmental grant revenue and drug compound feasibility revenue 
however  we expect no grant revenue or drug compound feasibility screening revenue in we do not expect any material product revenue until at least the third quarter of on june   we effected a for reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock  resulting in a reduction of our total common stock issued and outstanding from million shares to million shares 
all references to shares of common stock and per share data presented in this annual report on form k have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split on a retroactive basis 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and total stockholders equity was million 
we recognized net losses of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
beginning in the second half of  we expect to begin to earn commercial revenues for the sale of adasuve in the us and the eu 
we expect our operating expenses to increase in as we build the infrastructure to support the commercial manufacturing and commercialization of adasuve 
the approval of adasuve is our first regulatory approval 
in the united states  adasuve must be administered only in healthcare facilities enrolled in the adasuve rems program that have immediate access on site to equipment and personnel trained to manage acute bronchospasm  including advanced airway management intubation and mechanical ventilation 
we do not have a large sales and marketing organization and as a company  we do not have significant experience in the sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
if we or any partner are not able to successfully commercialize adasuve in the us  our ability to generate revenue will be jeopardized and  consequently  our business will be seriously harmed 
the process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
we consider the development of our product candidates to be crucial to our long term success 
the probability of success for each product candidate may be impacted by numerous factors  including preclinical data  clinical data  competition  device development  manufacturing capability  regulatory approval and commercial viability 
we plan to seek additional commercial partners for the worldwide development and commercialization for all of our product candidates 
if in the future we enter into additional partnerships  third parties could have control over preclinical development  clinical trials or the regulatory process for some of our product candidates 
accordingly  the progress of such product candidate would not be under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to any future 
table of contents partnerships or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
we anticipate that we and any partners will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant estimates and judgments in preparation of our financial statements 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals we estimate our preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on our estimates of the services received pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
preclinical study and clinical trial expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical studies  fees paid to contract research organizations and other clinical sites in connection with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of components and drug materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we record accruals for these preclinical study and clinical trial costs based upon the estimated amount of work completed 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses based on these estimates 
costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are entered in the trial 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and discussions with research institutions and clinical research organizations 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various preclinical studies and clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
to date  we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of preclinical study and clinical trial costs 
we make good faith estimates which we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risk and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
share based compensation we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and purchase rights issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 

table of contents the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is calculated based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant  reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting of the restricted stock unit 
our current estimate assumes no dividends will be paid prior to the vesting of the restricted stock unit 
we estimate the expected term of options based on the historical term periods of options that have been granted but are no longer outstanding and the estimated terms of outstanding options 
we estimate the volatility of our stock based on our actual historical volatility since our initial public offering 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expenses in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 
contingent consideration liability in august  we completed our purchase of all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro  and in exchange we i issued to the former stockholders of symphony allegro  or the allegro investors million shares of our common stock  ii issued to the allegro investors year warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share  and iii will pay to the allegro investors certain percentages of cash payments that may be generated from future partnering transactions pertaining to adasuve az staccato loxapine or az staccato alprazolam 
we estimate the fair value of the liability associated with the contingent cash payments to the allegro investors  or contingent consideration liability  on a quarterly basis using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model 
we derive multiple cash flow scenarios for each of the product candidates subject to the cash payments and apply a probability to each of the scenarios 
these probability and risk adjusted weighted average cash flows are then discounted utilizing our estimated weighted average cost of capital  or wacc 
our wacc considers our cash position  competition  risk of substitute products  and risk associated with the financing of the development projects 
we determined the discount rate to be and applied this rate to the probability adjusted cash flow scenarios 
we record any changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability in earnings in the period of the change 
certain events including  but not limited to  clinical trial results  fda approval or non approval of our submissions  the timing and terms of any strategic partnership agreement  the commercial success of adasuve  az or az and the discount rate assumption could have a material impact on the fair value of the contingent consideration liability  and as a result  our results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of the revenue recognition multiple element arrangements topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  or the codification 
in determining the accounting for collaboration agreements  we determine whether an arrangement involves multiple revenue generating deliverables that should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting or divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the arrangement represents a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy and the performance obligation period must be determined  if not already contractually defined  for the entire arrangement 
if the arrangement represents separate units of accounting  a revenue recognition policy must be determined for each unit 

table of contents effective january   we adopted the guidelines of accounting standards update  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu   which amends the criteria to identify separate units of accounting 
the revised guidance eliminated the residual method of allocation  and instead requires companies to use the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
when applying the relative selling price method  the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  if it exists  otherwise using third party evidence of selling price 
if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable  companies shall use their best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method 
where there are multiple deliverables combined as a single unit of accounting  revenues are deferred and recognized over the period that we remain obligated to perform services 
the specific methodology for the recognition of the revenue eg  straight line or according to specific performance criteria is determined on a case by case basis according to the facts and circumstances applicable to a given agreement 
up front  licensing type payments are assessed to determine whether or not the licensee is able to obtain any stand alone value from the license 
where this is not the case  we do not consider the license deliverable to be a separate unit of accounting  and we defer the revenue with revenue recognition for the license fee being assessed in conjunction with the other deliverables that constitute the combined unit of accounting 
for milestone payments  we follow the guidance of asu  milestone method of revenue recognition a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
asu provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions 
a vendor can recognize consideration in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
a milestone is considered substantive if  i there is uncertainty that the milestones will be met  ii the milestone can be achieved only with our past and current performance  and iii the achievement of the milestone will result in additional payment 
recently adopted accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
asu requires the presentation of total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we adopted these disclosure requirements in the first quarter of on may   the fasb issued asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
asu is the result of joint efforts by the fasb and the international accounting standards board to develop a single  converged fair value framework 
there are few differences between asu and its international counterpart  ifrs asu is largely consistent with existing fair value measurement principles in us gaap  however it expands asc s existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and makes other amendments 
the adoption of asu did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenue 
we had million  million  and million of revenues in  and  respectively 
in february we entered into a license and development agreement with biovail laboratories international srl  or biovail  in which we received an upfront payment of million 
in october  biovail gave notification of its intention to terminate the collaboration  at which time we recognized the upfront payment as revenues as we had fulfilled our obligations under the collaboration 
in  we also recognized million from our license and development agreement  or the cypress agreement  with cypress bioscience  inc  or cypress  and  of grant revenues from the us government s qualified therapeutic development program 
the cypress agreement contributed million and million of revenues in and  respectively and we earned  and million under the ferrer agreement in and  respectively 
table of contents in  we will not earn revenues from the cypress agreement  as amended  and we expect revenues from the ferrer agreement to increase 
the amount of the increase from the ferrer agreement will be dependent upon the timing of the achievement of certain milestones  if at all 
we expect commercialization of adasuve in the united states to begin in the second half of  generating product sales and or royalty revenues 
operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities  as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and manufacturing development efforts 
all research and development costs  including those funded by third parties  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigational sites where a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials are conducted  third party supplier  consultant and employee related expenses  which include salary  share based compensation and benefits  and facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
the table below sets forth our research and development expenses for  and broken out between product candidate and general research expenses based on our internal records and estimated allocations of employee time and related expenses year ended december  product candidate expenses general research total research and development research and development expenses were million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to was a result of the suspension of development of our az and staccato nicotine product candidates  in and the first quarter of  respectively  as well as our efforts to conserve cash resources  including a reduction in our workforce in february these reductions were partially offset by approximately million and million of cash bonuses and share based compensation expense incurred in that were not incurred in  as a result of our meeting certain corporate goals in in  to conserve resources  we reduced our general research efforts to focus our efforts on the adasuve nda resubmission and approval  and suspended development of the az product candidate 
in  we continued our development obligations under the cypress agreement for staccato nicotine 
in  we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we begin to execute on our post approval commitments 
these increases will be partially offset as certain manufacturing expenses classified as research and development in will be classified as inventory and cost of goods sold in as a result of the fda s approval of the adasuve nda 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel  including share based compensation  in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal and human resources functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility and information technology costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  patent related costs and professional fees for legal  consulting and accounting services 

table of contents the decrease in expenses as compared to was primarily due our efforts to conserve cash balance as well as a one time non cash reduction in expense 
our cash conservation efforts included the workforce reduction discussed above 
in march we incurred a non cash reduction in expense of million related to the termination of our lease and associated subleases of one of our mountain view facilities 
the one time non cash reduction in expense was a result of the reversal of deferred rent liability  net of the accelerated depreciation of the fixed assets related to the facility 
in addition  we incurred approximately million and million of cash bonuses and share based compensation expense in that were not incurred in  as a result of our meeting certain corporate goals in the decrease in expenses as compared to was primarily due to our efforts to reduce discretionary spending to conserve our cash 
we did not meet our corporate goals in and therefore did not recognize certain cash and share based bonus expenses related to potential bonuses 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase significantly in as we increase our infrastructure and incur selling and marketing expenses to support the expected commercial launch of adasuve 
change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability 
in connection with our acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro  we are obligated to pay the allegro investors certain percentages of cash payments that may be generated from future partnering transactions for az  adasuve and or az we measure the fair value of this contingent consideration liability at each balance sheet date 
any changes in the fair value of this contingent consideration liability will be recognized in earnings in the period of the change 
certain events including  but not limited to  clinical trial results  fda approval or non approval of our submissions  the timing and terms of strategic partnerships  the commercial success of az  adasuve and or az and the discount rate assumption could have a material impact on the fair value of the contingent liability  and as a result  our results of operations 
in  we increased the probability that we would internally commercialize adasuve in the united states rather than enter into a commercial partnership that would result in upfront milestone and royalty payments 
we are not required to pay the allegro investors percentages of revenues earned from internally commercialized products 
this change in assumption was partially offset by the approval of the adasuve nda in december and the december positive opinion of the ema committee for medicinal products for human recommending that adasuve be granted european union centralized marketing authorization by the ec 
marketing authorization for adasuve was granted by the ec on february  in october  we entered into the ferrer agreement 
as a result of this agreement  we revised upwards the probabilities  amounts and timing of certain cash flows for adasuve 
we recognized a non operating loss of million to reflect the increase in the contingent consideration liability during the year ended december  interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  primarily represents income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities balances  and restricted cash 
interest and other income  net was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  the amount primarily consisted of gains on the retirement of fixed assets as we sold certain equipment no longer being utilized 
the interest income was impacted by a loss on retirements of fixed assets of  we expect to continue to earn low interest income returns on our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances as we focus on investing with a priority on liquidity and capital preservation 
interest expense 
interest expense represents interest on our financing obligations and was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to was due to the declining debt balances as a result of our monthly payments 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to a full year s interest expense from the hercules note issued in may and the interest from the note issued to autoliv asp  inc or autoliv 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of equity securities  debt financings  revenues primarily from a licensing agreement and government grants  and payments from symphony allegro 
we have received additional funding from financing obligations  interest earned on investments  as described below  and funds received upon exercises of stock options and exercises of purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
our cash and cash equivalents balances are held in money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity  capital preservation and yield 
net cash used in provided by operating activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the net cash provided by or used in each of these periods primarily reflects net loss for these periods  offset in part by depreciation  non cash share based compensation  the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability  and non cash changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the other liabilities change in each year was related to the amortization of our deferred rent liability  which is a result of the straight line method of recognizing our facility rent expense and the recognition of tenant improvement reimbursements from the landlord as a deferred rent liability 
in  we received a payment of million under the ferrer agreement resulting in the decrease in accounts receivables 
in  the decrease in our deferred revenues was the result of the amortization of upfront payments on the ferrer agreement and the cypress agreement 
in  the ferrer agreement resulted in increases to other receivables and deferred revenues 
in  the deferred revenue balance resulted from upfront fees paid by cypress as required by the cypress agreement 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million  and million  and  respectively 
investing activities consist primarily of purchases and maturities of marketable securities and capital purchases 
during and we had maturities  net of purchases  of marketable securities of million and million  respectively 
during we purchased million of marketable securities  net of maturities 
purchases of property and equipment were million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
financing activities consist primarily of the sale of our common stock and warrants to purchase common stock  sale of a noncontrolling interest  equipment financing arrangements and financing obligations 
in  and  we received net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock of million  million  and million  respectively 
in and  payments on debt were million and million  respectively 
in  we had proceeds from debt borrowings  net of payments  of million 
in  we made a million payment to the allegro investors as a result of the receipt of the million upfront fee in accordance with the ferrer agreement  as well as classifying million of cash as restricted cash due to hercules requirement that we establish a restricted access account equal to the principal balance of the hercules debt 
in january  hercules removed the restricted access account requirement 
we believe that with current cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash balances  and our current expected cash usage  we have sufficient capital resources to meet our anticipated cash needs  at our current cost levels  into the second quarter of changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate or to alter our operations 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect 
the key assumptions underlying these estimates include expenditures related to the adasuve post approval commitments to both the fda and ec during this period being within budgeted levels  expenditures related to the adasuve commercial launch during this period within budgeted levels  no unexpected costs related to the development of our manufacturing capability  no unbudgeted growth in the number of our employees during this period  and no material shortfall in our budgeted revenues 

table of contents our forecast of the period of time that our financial resources will be adequate to support operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors 
in light of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the commercialization of adasuve  development of our product candidates and the extent to which we enter into additional strategic partnerships with third parties to participate in development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the cost and timing of the development of our commercialization abilities  the commercial success of adasuve or any other product candidates that are approved for marketing  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals or non approvals  the scope  rate of progress  results and costs of our preclinical studies  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the terms and timing of any additional distribution  strategic partnership or licensing agreements that we may establish  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the cost and timing of establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
we will need to raise additional funds to support our operations  and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to successfully commercialize adasuve  perform our post approval commitments to the fda and ec  manufacture commercial quantities of adasuve or continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs  or other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
applicable listing standards  may affect our ability to consummate certain types of offerings of our securities in the future 
our february underwritten public offering involved the sale of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock 
if we raise funds through additional collaborative or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
contractual obligations we lease a  square foot manufacturing  office and laboratory facility in mountain view  california  which we began to occupy in the fourth quarter of the lease expires on march   and we have two options to extend the lease for five years each 
we believe that the mountain view facility is sufficient for our office  manufacturing and laboratory needs for at least the next three years 
on may   we entered into a loan and security agreement  or the loan agreement  with hercules 
under the terms of the loan agreement  we borrowed  at an interest rate equal to the higher of i or ii plus the prime rate as reported in the wall street journal  with a maximum interest rate of  and issued to hercules a secured term promissory note evidencing the loan 
we made interest only payments through january and beginning in february the loan began to be repaid in equal monthly installments 

table of contents on november   we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement  or the manufacture agreement  with autoliv relating to the commercial supply of chemical heat packages that can be incorporated into our staccato device 
autoliv had developed these chemical heat packages for us pursuant to a development agreement between autoliv and us executed in october in june and february  we entered into agreements to amend the terms of the manufacture agreement  or the amendments 
under the terms of the first of the amendments  we paid autoliv million and issued autoliv a million unsecured promissory note in return for a production line for the commercial manufacture of chemical heat packages 
a production line is comprised of two identical and self sustaining cells  and the first such cell has been completed  installed and qualified 
under the terms of the second of the amendments  the original million note was cancelled and a new unsecured promissory note was issued with a reduced principal amount of million  or the second note  and production on the second cell halted 
the second note is payable in equal monthly installments of approximately  and the last payment is scheduled for december in the event that we request completion of the second cell of the first production line for the commercial manufacture of chemical heat packages  autoliv will complete  install and fully qualify such second cell for a cost to us of million and autoliv will transfer ownership of such cell to us upon the payment in full of such million and the second note 
at our request  autoliv will manufacture up to two additional production lines for the commercial manufacture of chemical heat packages at a cost not to exceed  for each additional line 
we will pay autoliv a specified purchase price  which varies based on annual quantities ordered by us  per chemical heat package delivered 
the initial term of the manufacture agreement expired on december   at which time the manufacture agreement renewed for a five year term  and will continue to automatically renew for successive five year renewal terms unless we or autoliv notify the other party no less than months prior to the end of the then current renewal term that such party wishes to terminate the manufacture agreement 
our scheduled future minimum contractual payments  net of sublease income  including interest at december   are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years thereafter operating lease obligations term note obligations as part of our purchase of all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro in august  we agreed to pay to the allegro investors certain percentages of cash payments that may be generated from future partnering transactions pertaining to adasuve az staccato loxapine or az staccato alprazolam
