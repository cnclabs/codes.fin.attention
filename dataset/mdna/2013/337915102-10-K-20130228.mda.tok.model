regulation and supervision introduction firstmerit  firstmerit bank  and many of their nonbanking subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation  examination and supervision under by federal and state law 
the regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries is intended primarily for the protection of depositors  borrowers  other customers  the fdic federal deposit insurance fund the dif and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of our securities holders 
this intensive regulatory environment  among other things  may restrict our ability to diversify our services  acquire depository institutions in certain markets or pay dividends on our capital stock 
it also may require firstmerit to provide financial support to its banking subsidiary  maintain capital balances in excess of those desired by management and pay higher deposit insurance premiums depending upon the condition and performance of the dif and its compliance with the federal deposit insurance act fdia as a result of the financial condition of depository institutions in general 
significant aspects of the laws and regulations that apply to firstmerit and its subsidiaries are described below 
these descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable statutes  legislation  regulations and policies  as they may be amended  and as interpreted and applied  by federal or state regulatory agencies 
such statutes  regulations and policies are continually under review and are subject to change at any time  particularly in the current economic and regulatory environment  and as a result of the numerous regulations required by changes in applicable statutes  legislation  regulations  policies and practices  including changes in the capital adequacy rules applicable to us and our subsidiaries  may have a material adverse effect on firstmerit and its business 
the dodd frank act the dodd frank act was signed into law on july   and effected sweeping financial regulatory reforms  including the following creates the consumer financial protection bureau as a new agency to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection  including implementing  examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws  
table of contents authorizes the elimination of federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts  amends the electronic fund transfer act to  among other things  give the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve authority to establish rules regulating interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over billion  such as firstmerit bank  and enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer  restricts federal law preemption of state laws for subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks and federal thrifts  permits the establishment of branch offices of banks throughout the us  extends to most bank holding companies the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions  which  among other things  will disallow treatment of trust preferred securities as tier capital  subject to certain phase in and grandfathered exceptions  requires the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ to make its capital requirements for national banks countercyclical so they increase during economic expansions and decrease during economic contractions  requires bank holding companies and banks both to be well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state  changes the federal deposit insurance assessment base from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital  eliminated the maximum size of the dif  and increases the minimum size of the dif  imposes comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  including certain provisions that would effectively prohibit fdic insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses within those institutions  requires large  publicly traded bank holding companies to create a risk committee responsible for the oversight of enterprise risk management firstmerit already has risk committees of its management and board of directors  implements corporate governance revisions applicable to all public companies not just financial institutions  including revisions regarding executive compensation disclosure  permanently adopts the  limit for fdic insurance coverage  restricts the ability of banks to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds and to engage in proprietary trading under the volcker rule  increases authority of the federal reserve and the fdic s authority to examine our subsidiaries  requires annual capital stress testing for institutions with billion or more in assets  and expands the requirement for holding companies to serve as sources of financial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to further rulemaking and will therefore continue to develop over several years 
this makes it extremely difficult to assess the overall financial impact the dodd frank act will have on firstmerit  its customers and the financial industry 
however  the legislative provisions that affect the payment of interest on demand deposits and assessment of interchange fees have increased and are likely to continue to increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain 
table of contents revenues those deposits may generate for more information  see item a  risk factors debit card interchange fee regulation may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
provisions in the dodd frank act and federal reserve  occ and fdic proposals to revise the definitions and types of capital and the risk weightings of on and off balance sheet exposures through proposed basel iii capital rules could require us to seek other sources of capital in the future and will limit the types of instruments includable in capital 
some of the rules that have been proposed and  in some cases  adopted  under the dodd frank act are discussed further below  along with other regulatory matters affecting firstmerit and firstmerit bank 
regulatory agencies bank holding company 
firstmerit  as a bank holding company  is subject to regulation under the bhca and to inspection  examination and supervision by the federal reserve board under the bhca 
subsidiary bank 
firstmerit bank is subject to regulation and examination generally by the occ and the new consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb for consumer compliance 
as a fdic member  firstmerit bank is also subject to assessments payable to the dif  and various fdic requirements 
nonbank subsidiaries 
many of firstmerit nonbank subsidiaries also are subject to regulation by the federal reserve and other applicable federal and state agencies 
firstmerit broker dealer and investment advisory subsidiaries are regulated and examined by the sec  the financial industry regulatory authority  and state securities regulators  which require education and licensing of advisors  require reporting and impose business conduct rules  as well as certain disclosure and regulatory requirements of the investment advisors act of  as administered by the sec 
firstmerit insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies  which require education and licensing of agencies and individual agents  require reports and impose business conduct rules 
other nonbank subsidiaries of firstmerit are subject to the laws and regulations of both the federal government and the various states in which they conduct business  including federal and state laws regarding the mortgage banking business 
sec and nasdaq 
firstmerit common stock is listed on the nasdaq global select market nasdaq under the trading symbol fmer  and is subject to the rules and listing requirements of nasdaq 
bank holding company regulation as a bank holding company  firstmerit activities are subject to extensive regulation by the federal reserve or its delegates under the bhca 
generally  the bhca limits the business of bank holding companies to banking  managing or controlling banks and other activities that the federal reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
firstmerit is required to file periodic reports with the federal reserve and such additional information as the federal reserve may require  and is subject to examinations by the federal reserve 
the federal reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies  including  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  issue cease and desist  removal orders  and other actions  require that a bank holding company divest subsidiaries including its subsidiary banks  and 
table of contents in general  initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices and order the cessation of any activity that it has reasonable grounds to believe constitutes a serious risk to the soundness  safety or stability of an institution or its subsidiaries 
under federal reserve policy and the fdia  a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support those subsidiary banks 
the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an under capitalized subsidiary bank and may limit the payment of dividends and payment of interest or other distributions to the holding company s shareholders and holders of its other capital instruments 
the dodd frank act codified this policy as part of the fdia  requiring holding companies to provide financial assistance to their fdic insured depository institution subsidiaries in financial distress 
regulations are to be adopted by the federal reserve implementing new section a of the fdia 
the bhca requires prior approval by the federal reserve for a bank holding company to directly or indirectly acquire more than of the voting shares in any bank or bank holding company 
factors taken into consideration in making such a determination include the effect of the acquisition on competition  the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition  the applicant s anti money laundering compliance  the projected capital ratios and levels on a post acquisition basis  and the acquiring institution record of addressing the credit needs of the communities it serves 
the dodd frank act also requires the federal reserve to consider whether the acquisition would result in risks to the stability of the us banking of or financial system 
the bhca also governs interstate acquisitions of banks and restricts the nonbanking activities of firstmerit to those determined by the federal reserve to be financial in nature  or incidental or complementary to such financial activity  without regard to territorial restrictions 
transactions among firstmerit bank and its affiliates are also subject to certain limitations and restrictions under the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulations  as described more fully below under dividends and transactions with affiliates 
a qualifying bank holding company may elect to become a financial holding company and thereby affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity  which are not otherwise permissible for a bank holding company 
firstmerit has not elected to seek financial holding company status 
dividends and transactions with affiliates firstmerit is a legal entity separate and distinct from firstmerit bank and its other subsidiaries 
firstmerit principal source of funds to pay dividends on its common shares and preferred shares and service its debt is dividends from firstmerit bank and its other subsidiaries 
various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends that firstmerit bank may pay to firstmerit without prior regulatory approval  including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums as discussed further below under capital requirements and adequate liquidity 
the federal reserve and the occ have policies that provide that fdic insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
in addition  the prior approval of the occ is required for the payment of a dividend by firstmerit bank  if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the two preceding years 
if  in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority  a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice  such authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such bank cease and desist from such practice 
depending on the financial condition of the bank  the applicable 
table of contents regulatory authority might deem the bank to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice if the bank were to pay dividends and the occ has the authority to limit its dividends payable by national banks 
the federal reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong 
thus  the ability of firstmerit to pay dividends in the future is currently influenced  and could be further influenced  by bank regulatory policies  capital guidelines the annual stress tests and our capital planning activities 
firstmerit bank is subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value to firstmerit and its nonbanking affiliates  whether in the form of loans and other extensions of credit  investments and asset or security purchases  or as other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate including guarantees  each of which is referred to as a covered transaction 
these regulations limit the types and amounts of transactions including loans due and extensions of credit from bank subsidiaries that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arm s length basis 
these regulations generally require that any covered transaction by firstmerit bank or its subsidiaries with an affiliate must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited  as to any one of the corporation or its nonbank subsidiaries  to of firstmerit bank s capital stock and surplus  and  as to the corporation and all nonbank subsidiaries in the aggregate  to of firstmerit bank s capital stock and surplus 
the dodd frank act significantly expands the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization 
beginning in july  the dodd frank act requires that the of capital limit on covered transactions apply to financial subsidiaries 
covered transactions are defined by statute to include  among other things  a loan or extension of credit  as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate  a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve from the affiliate  the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan  and the issuance of a guarantee  acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate 
all covered transactions  including certain additional transactions such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest  must be conducted on market terms 
loans  if any  from firstmerit to firstmerit bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other indebtedness of firstmerit bank 
in the event of firstmerit bankruptcy  commitments by firstmerit to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of firstmerit bank will be entitled to priority of payment  subject to various limitations 
regulation of national banks as a national banking association  firstmerit bank is subject to regulation and regular examinations by the occ 
occ regulations govern permissible activities  capital requirements  branching  dividend limitations  investments  loans and other matters 
furthermore  firstmerit bank is subject  as a member  to certain rules and regulations of the federal reserve including the limits on affiliate transactions 
under the bank merger act  the prior approval of the occ is required for a national bank to merge with  or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of  another bank 
in reviewing applications to approve merger and other acquisition transactions  the occ and other bank regulatory authorities may include among their considerations the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions  the capital position of the combined organization  the applicant s performance under the community reinvestment act and the effectiveness of the entities in restricting money laundering activities 

table of contents firstmerit bank is a member of the dif and its deposits are insured by the fdic to the fullest extent permitted by law 
as a result  it is subject to regulation and deposit insurance assessments by the fdic as described more fully below under deposit insurance 
under the dodd frank act  firstmerit bank also is subject to regulation and examinations by the new cfpb  which shall have centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection  including implementing  examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws 
capital requirements the federal reserve has risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and the occ has risk based capital guidelines for national banks and state non member banks  respectively 
the guidelines provide a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations  takes off balance sheet exposures expressly into account in evaluating capital adequacy  and minimizes disincentives to holding assets considered by the occ to be liquid and low risk 
capital levels as measured by these standards are also used to categorize fdic insured depository institutions for purposes of certain prompt corrective action regulatory provisions 
the minimum guideline for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of the minimum total risk based capital ratio must be composed of voting common shareholders equity  minority interests in certain equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock and qualified trust preferred securities although the tier capital treatment of trust preferred securities is phased out under the dodd frank act  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets  including the unrealized net gains and losses  after applicable taxes  on available for sale securities carried at fair value commonly known as tier risk based capital 
the remainder of total risk based capital commonly known as tier risk based capital may consist of certain amounts of hybrid capital instruments  mandatory convertible debt  subordinated debt  preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  loan and lease loss allowance and net unrealized gains on certain available for sale equity securities  all subject to limitations established by the guidelines 
under the guidelines  capital is compared to the relative risk related to the balance sheet 
to derive the risk included in the balance sheet  one of four risk weights   and is applied to different balance sheet and off balance sheet assets 
the capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
the federal reserve has also established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies 
the federal reserve guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of tier capital to average assets excluding the loan and lease loss allowance  goodwill and certain other intangibles  or leverage ratio  of for bank holding companies that meet certain criteria  including having the highest regulatory rating  and for all other bank holding companies 
the guidelines further provide that bank holding companies  especially those experiencing growth through acquisitions or otherwise  and depending upon the riskiness of their business and other circumstances  will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
the occ also has adopted minimum leverage ratio guidelines for national banks 
neither firstmerit nor firstmerit bank has been advised that any specific heightened minimum capital ratio guidelines are applicable to either of them 
the federal reserve review of certain bank holding company transactions is affected by whether the applying bank holding company is well capitalized 
to be deemed well capitalized  the bank holding 
table of contents company must have a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least  and must not be subject to any written agreement  order  capital directive or prompt corrective action directive issued by the federal reserve board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
firstmerit capital ratios meet the requirements to be deemed well capitalized under federal reserve guidelines 
see note regulatory matters in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the federal banking agencies have established a system of prompt corrective action to identify undercapitalized institutions  and to resolve these promptly 
this system is based on five capital level categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the federal banking agencies may  and in some cases must  take certain supervisory actions depending upon a bank capital level 
for example  the banking agencies must appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank within days after it becomes critically undercapitalized  unless the bank primary regulator determines  with the concurrence of the fdic  that other action would better achieve regulatory purposes 
banking operations otherwise may be significantly affected depending on a bank capital category 
for example  a bank that is not well capitalized generally is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market  and the holding company of any undercapitalized depository institution must guarantee  in part  the bank capital restoration plan and this guaranty is given a priority in bankruptcy of the holding company  
in order to be well capitalized  a bank must have total risk based capital of at least  tier risk based capital of at least and a leverage ratio of at least  and the bank must not be subject to any written agreement  order  capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
firstmerit management believes that firstmerit bank meets the requirements to be deemed well capitalized according to the guidelines described above 
see note regulatory matters in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
federal law permits the occ to order the pro rata assessment of shareholders of a national bank whose capital stock has become impaired  by losses or otherwise  to relieve a deficiency in such national bank capital stock 
this statute also provides for the enforcement of any such pro rata assessment of shareholders of such national bank to cover such impairment of capital stock by sale  to the extent necessary  of the capital stock owned by any assessed shareholder failing to pay the assessment 
as the sole shareholder of firstmerit bank  firstmerit is subject to such provisions 
the risk based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies are based on the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards basel i  published by the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee in in  the basel committee published a new  more risk sensitive capital adequacy framework basel ii for large  internationally active banking organizations 
in december  the federal banking agencies issued final rules making the implementation of certain parts of basel ii mandatory for any bank that has consolidated total assets of at least billion excluding certain assets or has consolidated on balance sheet foreign exposure of at least billion  and making it voluntary for other banks 
in response to concerns regarding the complexity and cost associated with implementing the basel ii rules  the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in july that would have revised the existing risk based capital framework for banks not subject to the basel ii rules 
the proposed rules would allow banks other than the large basel ii banks to elect to adopt the new risk weighting methodologies set forth 
table of contents in the proposed rules or remain subject to the existing risk based capital rules 
firstmerit will not be required to implement basel ii 
until the final rules for the non basel ii banks are adopted by the federal banking agencies  firstmerit is unable to predict whether and when its subsidiary banks will adopt the new capital guidelines 
comments on the proposed rules were due to the federal banking agencies in october  but no definitive final rules have been issued 
the dodd frank act requires the federal reserve board  the occ and the fdic to adopt regulations imposing minimum basel i based capital requirements in cases where the basel ii based capital requirements and any changes in capital regulations resulting from basel iii see below otherwise would permit lower requirements 
in december  the federal reserve board  the occ and the fdic issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking that would implement this requirement 
in december  the basel committee released a final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation basel iii 
when implemented by the federal banking agencies and fully phased in  basel iii will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital  with a greater emphasis on common equity 
the basel iii final capital framework  among other things  i introduces as a new capital measure of common equity tier cet  ii specifies that tier capital consist of cet and additional tier capital instruments meeting specified requirements  iii defines cet narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet and not to the other components of capital  iv expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations  and v establishes capital conservation buffers  which if not maintained  will limit or prohibit  based on the size of the deficiency  the payment of dividends or discretionary bonuses 
when fully phased in on january   basel iii will require banks to maintain i as a newly adopted international standard  a minimum ratio of cet to risk weighted assets of  plus a capital conservation buffer which is added to the cet ratio as that buffer is phased in  which will effectively result in a minimum ratio of cet to risk weighted assets of  ii a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of  plus the capital conservation buffer which is added to the tier capital ratio as that buffer is phased in  effectively resulting in a minimum tier capital ratio of on full implementation  iii a minimum ratio of total tier plus tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least  plus the capital conservation buffer which is added to the total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in  effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of upon full implementation and iv as a newly adopted international standard  a minimum leverage ratio of  calculated as the ratio of tier capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off balance sheet exposures computed as the average for each quarter of the month end ratios for the quarter 
initially  banks will be required to maintain cet to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets  and total capital to risk weighted assets 
basel iii also provides for a countercyclical capital buffer  generally imposed when federal regulatory agencies determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk  that would be in addition to the capital conservation buffer in the range of to when fully implemented  potentially resulting in total buffers of to 
the countercyclical capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress 
banking institutions with a ratio of cet to risk weighted assets above the minimum  but below the conservation buffer or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer  when applicable will have constraints imposed on their dividends  equity repurchases and compensation  based on the amount of the shortfall 
the basel iii final framework provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to cet  including the deduction of most mortgage servicing rights  deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable 
table of contents income and significant investments in non consolidated financial entities if any one such category exceeds of cet or if all such categories in the aggregate exceed of cet implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to cet will be phased in over a five year period beginning on january  implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on january  at and be phased in over a four year period increasing each subsequent january by the same amount until it reaches on january  the federal bank regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking npr of regulations implementing basel iii on august  the federal reserve  occ and fdic have delayed action on the npr pending review of comments received  and it is uncertain when revised basel iii rules will be re proposed or adopted 
the basel committee is considering further amendments to basel iii  including imposition of additional capital surcharges on globally systemically important financial institutions 
in addition to basel iii  the dodd frank act requires or permits federal banking agencies to adopt regulations affecting capital requirements in a number of respects  including potentially more stringent capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions  and has proposed separate rules regarding liquidity 
accordingly  the regulations ultimately applicable to firstmerit may differ substantially from the latest npr 
although we do not believe the corporation is a systemically important financial institution  requirements of higher capital levels or higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the corporation s net income and return on equity 
deposit insurance the fdic assesses deposit insurance premiums on all fdic insured depository institutions based on assets less tangible capital and risk ratings 
insurance premiums for each insured institution are determined based upon the institution capital level and supervisory rating provided to the fdic by the institution primary federal regulator and other information by the fdic to be relevant to the risk posed to the dif by the institution 
fdic insurance assessments have been increasing and could materially effect earnings especially in a low interest environment 
over the past several years  bank failures  increased fdic resolution costs and depleted the dif 
in order to maintain a strong funding position and reserve ratio of the dif as required by law  the fdic issued a final rule in december that increased assessment rates uniformly by basis points cents for every of deposits beginning with the first quarter of additional changes  beginning april   were to require institutions in the highest risk category to pay a larger share of premiums by factoring in rate adjustments based on secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels 
the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa instituted two temporary programs effective through december  to further insure customer deposits at fdic member banks deposit accounts were insured up to  per customer up from  and noninterest bearing transactional accounts were fully insured unlimited coverage 
the dodd frank act made permanent the  per customer insurance limit for deposit accounts  and in november  the fdic issued a final rule under the dodd frank act that continued temporary unlimited coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts 
the separate coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts became effective on december  and terminated on december  
table of contents in may  the fdic issued a final rule that levied a special assessment applicable to all insured depository institutions totaling basis points of each institution s total assets less tier capital as of june   which was collected on september  in the amount of million from firstmerit bank 
in november  the fdic adopted a final rule requiring insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and the prepaid assessments for these periods were collected on december   along with the regular quarterly risk based deposit insurance assessment for the third quarter of for the fourth quarter of and for all of  the prepaid assessment rate was based on each institution total base assessment rate in effect on september   adjusted to assume a annualized deposit growth rate  for the and periods the computation was adjusted by an additional basis points increase in the assessment rate 
the three year prepayment for firstmerit determined as of september   totaled million 
during  and  million  million and million of this prepayment was recognized as expense  respectively 
in october  the fdic adopted a new dif restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches by september   as required by the dodd frank act 
under the new restoration plan  the fdic has foregone the uniform increase of basis points in initial assessment rates that was scheduled to take place on january  and is maintaining the current schedule of assessment rates for all depository institutions 
at least semi annually during the five year dif restoration period  the fdic will update its loss and income projections for the fund and  if needed  will increase or decrease assessment rates 
the dif had billion of assets at september   and it is expected that fdic insurance assessments will continue at currently elevated levels for the foreseeable future 
the fdic issued final rules changing the deposit insurance assessment base from total domestic deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity  as required by the dodd frank act  effective april  the fdic also issued final rules revising the deposit insurance assessment system for large institutions 
the fdic rules created a two scorecard system  one for most large institutions such as firstmerit bank that have more than billion in assets  and another for highly complex institutions that have over billion in assets and are fully owned by a parent with over billion in assets 
each scorecard has a performance score and a loss severity score that is to be combined to produce a total score between and  which translates into an initial assessment rate based on a scale with disproportionately higher rates for higher scores 
in calculating these scores  the fdic continues to utilize supervisory ratings as well as certain financial information  which introduces certain new financial measures to assess an institution s ability to withstand asset related and funding related stresses  and eliminates the use of risk categories 
long term debt credit ratings consistent with the dodd frank act would no longer be considered 
the fdic is also able to make discretionary upward or downward adjustments of up to points to the total score  based on significant risk factors not adequately addressed by the scorecard 
for large institutions  including firstmerit bank  the initial base assessment rate would range from to annual basis points 
after the effect of potential base rate adjustments  the total base assessment rate could range from to annual basis points 
the potential adjustments to an institution s initial base assessment rate include i a potential decrease of up to basis points for certain long term unsecured debt  and ii a potential increase of up to basis points for brokered deposits in excess of of domestic deposits 
as the dif reserve ratio grows  the rate schedule will be adjusted downward 
additionally  the proposed rule includes a new adjustment for depository institution debt under which an institution would pay an additional premium equal to basis points on every dollar of long term unsecured debt held that was issued by another insured depository institution 

table of contents all fdic insured depository institutions must pay an additional quarterly assessment  based on deposit levels  to provide funds for the payment of interest on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the federal housing finance board 
the fico bonds were issued to capitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
the fico assessments are adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment bases of the fdic insurance funds and do not vary regardless of a depository institution capitalization or supervisory evaluations 
firstmerit s fico assessments average million annually 
our total fdic insurance expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
firstmerit is generally unable to control or predict the amount of premiums that it must pay for fdic insurance 
fdic deposit insurance assessments are based upon the fdic dif reserve ratio and the fdic dif restoration plan  as well as the dif losses due to bank failures  and continuing changes to the fdic deposit insurance assessment methods  including the base upon which dif premiums are charged 
therefore  we may experience further increases in the costs of fdic insurance  which could have a material adverse effect on firstmerit interest margins and earnings 
fiscal and monetary policies firstmerit business and earnings are affected significantly by the federal fiscal and monetary policies 
firstmerit is particularly affected by the policies of the federal reserve  which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve are a conducting open market operations in united states government securities  b changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions  c imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions deposits  and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowing by banks and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as interest rates generally  which  in turn affect the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
for that reason alone  federal reserve policies have a material effect on the earnings of firstmerit 
since september   the federal reserve has been engaged in a series of securities purchase programs and has set the targeted federal funds rate at annually 
these actions have resulted in historically low interest rates  which the federal reserve s federal open market committee has announced on december  that it expects to continue until unemployment is less than  one two year inflation is greater than and longer term inflation is well anchored 
privacy provisions of gramm leach bliley act under the gramm leach bliley act of  federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party 
antimoney laundering and the usa patriot act the usa patriot act of and its related regulations require insured depository institutions  broker dealers and certain other financial institutions to have policies  procedures  and controls to detect  prevent  and report money laundering and terrorist financing 
the statute and its regulations also provide for information sharing  subject to conditions  between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions  as well as among financial institutions  for counter terrorism purposes 
failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing  or to comply with all of the 
table of contents relevant laws or regulations  could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
in addition  federal banking regulators are required  when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications  to take into account the effectiveness of the antimoney laundering policies  procedures and controls of the applicants 
tarp in response to the ongoing financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  eesa was signed into law in october and established the treasury s troubled assets relief program tarp 
as part of tarp  the treasury established the capital purchase program cpp to provide up to billion of funding to eligible financial institutions through the purchase of mortgages  mortgage backed securities  capital stock and other financial instruments for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on january   firstmerit completed the sale to the treasury of million of newly issued firstmerit nonvoting preferred shares as part of the cpp and a warrant to purchase  firstmerit common shares at an exercise price of per share 
on april   firstmerit completed the repurchase from the treasury of all million of the nonvoting preferred shares  and on may   firstmerit completed the repurchase of the warrant held by the treasury 
firstmerit is therefore no longer subject to the compensation and expenditure limits or other rules applicable to tarp recipients

corporate governance the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act effected broad reforms to areas of corporate governance and financial reporting for public companies under the jurisdiction of the sec 
significant additional corporate governance and financial reporting reforms have since been implemented by nasdaq  and apply to firstmerit 
firstmerit corporate governance policies include an audit committee charter  a compensation committee charter  corporate governance guidelines  a corporate governance and nominating committee charter  and a code of business conduct and ethics 
the board of directors reviews firstmerit corporate governance practices on a continuing basis 
these and other corporate governance policies have been provided previously to shareholders and are available  along with other information on firstmerit corporate governance practices  on the firstmerit website at www 
firstmerit 
com 
the content on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k unless expressly noted 
as directed by section a of the sarbanes oxley act  firstmerit chief executive officer and chief financial officer are each required to certify that firstmerit quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact 
the rules have several requirements  including having these officers certify that they are responsible for establishing  maintaining  and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of firstmerit internal controls  they have made certain disclosures about firstmerit internal controls to its auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors  and they have included information in firstmerit quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes in internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the evaluation 
the dodd frank act contains significant corporate governance measures  some of which are applicable to all public companies while others apply only to financial institutions  and many of which are not yet fully implemented 
for example  the federal reserve is required under the dodd frank act to issue regulations 
table of contents requiring each publicly traded bank holding with total consolidated assets of not less than billion  such as the corporation  to establish a risk committee responsible for the oversight of the enterprise wide risk management practices of the bank holding company 
such risk committees will be required to include such number of independent directors as the federal reserve may determine to be appropriate  based on the nature of operations  size of assets and other appropriate criteria  and include at least one risk management expert having experience in identifying  assessing and managing risk exposures of large  complex firms 
firstmerit already has a risk committee of management and a risk committee of its board of directors  and intends to adapt those committees to comply with the requirements developed under dodd frank 
rules implementing the risk committee provisions have not been proposed as of december  many of the other dodd frank corporate governance provisions involve executive and incentive compensation practices and annual disclosures relating thereto  certain of which are summarized under executive and incentive compensation below 
executive and incentive compensation in june  the federal reserve  occ and fdic issued joint interagency guidance on incentive compensation policies the joint guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk taking 
this principles based guidance  which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization  either individually or as part of a group  is based upon the key principles that a banking organization s incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risk taking beyond the organization s ability to effectively identify and manage risks  ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management  and iii be supported by strong corporate governance  including active and effective oversight by the organization s board of directors 
pursuant to the joint guidance  the federal reserve will review  as part of a regular  risk focused examination process  the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions such as firstmerit 
such reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements 
the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination and deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution s supervisory ratings  which can affect the institution s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions 
enforcement actions may be taken against an institution if its incentive compensation arrangements  or related risk management control or governance processes  pose a risk to the organization s safety and soundness and prompt and effective measures are not being taken to correct the deficiencies 
on march   the federal banking regulatory agencies jointly issued proposed rules on incentive based compensation arrangements under applicable provisions of the dodd frank act the proposed rules 
the proposed rules generally apply to financial institution with billion or more in assets that maintain incentive based compensation arrangements for certain covered employees 
the proposed rules i prohibit covered financial institutions from maintaining incentive based compensation arrangements that encourage covered persons to expose the institution to inappropriate risk by providing the covered person with excessive compensation  ii prohibit covered financial institutions from establishing or maintaining incentive based compensation arrangements for covered persons that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss  iii require covered financial institutions to maintain policies and procedures appropriate to their size  complexity and use of incentive based compensation to help ensure compliance with the proposed rules  and iv require covered financial institutions to provide enhanced disclosure to regulators regarding their incentive based compensation arrangements for covered persons within days following the end of the fiscal year 
final rules have not been adopted 
the proposal seeks incentive compensation that balances risk and 
table of contents financial rewards  is compatible with effective controls and risk management  and which is supported by strong corporate governance 
public companies will also be required  once stock exchanges impose additional listing requirements under the dodd frank act  to implement clawback procedures for incentive compensation payments and to disclose the details of the procedures that allow recovery of incentive compensation that was paid on the basis of erroneous financial information necessitating a restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements 
this clawback policy is intended to apply to compensation paid within a three year look back window of the restatement and would cover all executives who received incentive awards 
the dodd frank act also provides shareholders the opportunity to cast a non binding vote on executive compensation practices  imposes new executive compensation disclosure requirements  and contains additional considerations of the independence of compensation advisors 
future legislation and regulation various legislative and regulatory proposals affecting financial institutions are considered regularly by congress and our financial services regulatory agencies 
such legislation and rules may continue to change banking statutes and the operating environment of firstmerit and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways  and could significantly increase or decrease our costs of doing business  change permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among financial institutions 
with only a limited number of dodd frank act rulemakings having been proposed and finalized and the continuing implementation of final rules and regulations thereunder  the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions cannot be predicted  although regulatory changes are expected to continue to be numerous  as dodd frank act rulemaking continues

risk factors 
our business could be affected by any of the risks noted below  although such risks are not the only risks that we face 
additional risks that are not presently known or that we presently consider to be immaterial could also have a material  adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks relating to economic and market conditions difficult market conditions and economic trends may adversely affect our industry and our business 
beginning in the latter half of through mid  the united states economy was in recession  with business activity across a wide range of industries and regions greatly reduced 
although economic conditions show improvement  certain sectors of the united states economy  such as real estate  remain weak and unemployment rates  specifically in ohio  illinois and pennsylvania  remain high 
local governments and many businesses still face serious difficulties due to lower consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
market conditions over the past three years have also led to the failure and merger of a number of financial institutions  including a high level of failures in illinois 
these failures  as well as projected future failures  have had a significant negative impact on the capitalization levels of the fdic dif  which has led to significant increases in deposit insurance premiums paid by financial institutions and pervasive legislative and regulatory changes  including the dodd frank act 

table of contents our success depends  to a certain extent  upon economic and political conditions  local and national  as well as governmental fiscal and monetary policies 
conditions such as inflation  recession  wages and business income  unemployment  taxes  changes in interest rates  money supply and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our asset quality  deposit levels and loan demand and  therefore  our earnings and our capital 
because we have a significant amount of real estate loans  additional decreases in the value of real estate collateral securing the payment of such loans or continued low values of real estate sales which could result in increased delinquencies  foreclosures and customer bankruptcies  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our credit losses and on our operating results 
adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers  including those involving commercial real estate  to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse effects on our earnings and cash flows 
as a result of the challenges presented by current economic conditions  we continue to face the following risks the increased regulation of our industry  including heightened legal standards and operational requirements  which are expected to increase our costs and may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities  and further disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including actions by rating agencies and changing investor expectations  which may result in an inability to borrow on favorable terms or at all from other financial institutions or sell our debt and equity securities 
overall  while economic and market conditions have improved in the united states and in our primary geographic markets  there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue or that the economic and market conditions will not deteriorate in the future 
changes in the general economic conditions and real estate valuations in our primary market areas could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
a majority of the lending and deposit gathering activities made by our subsidiaries are to individuals and small to medium sized businesses in ohio  chicago  illinois  and western pennsylvania and our success depends in part on the general economic conditions of these areas 
real estate values in ohio  illinois and pennsylvania continue to be negatively affected by the slow economic recovery 
continuing or worsening conditions in the national economy could reduce our growth rate  impair our ability to collect payments on loans  increase delinquencies  increase problem assets and foreclosures and related expenses  increase claims and lawsuits  increase devaluations recognized within our real estate portfolio  decrease the demand for our products and services and decrease the value and liquidity of collateral for loans  especially real estate values  which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to interest rate risk 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest earning assets consisting primarily of loans and  to a lesser extent  securities and the interest expense generated by our interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of deposits and wholesale borrowings 
the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of our interest earning assets  the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities 
these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interest earning 
table of contents assets and our interest bearing liabilities which  in turn  are impacted by such external factors as the local economy  competition for loans and deposits  federal reserve monetary policy and market interest rates 
the cost of our deposits and short term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short term interest rates  which reflects the federal reserve monetary policy and actions  among other things 
the federal reserve has announced it will maintain short term interest rates near zero into  or until unemployment is less than and the two year inflation rate exceeds  provided the longer term inflation rate is well anchored 
however  the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by intermediate term ie  five year interest rates  which are set by the market and generally vary from day to day 
the level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates  and the pace at which such movements occur and the repricing of our liabilities and assets 
if the interest rates on our interest bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest earning assets  our net interest income and our earnings will decline 
our net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted if the interest rates on our interest earning assets decline more quickly than the interest rates on our interest bearing liabilities 
such changes in interest rates could affect our ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits  the fair values of our securities and other financial assets 
changes in interest rates could affect the fair values of our liabilities and the average lives of our loan and securities portfolios 
increases in prepayment due to interest rate changes could also shorten the maturities and yields on our investment securities  especially mortgage backed securities 
increases in interest rates could adversely affect mortgage originations and the ability of borrowers to make higher payments on variable rate loans 
changes in interest rates could also have an effect on the level of loan refinancing activity which  in turn  would impact the amount of prepayment penalty income we receive on our multi family and commercial real estate cre loans 
as prepayment penalties are recorded as interest income  the extent to which they increase or decrease during any given period could have an impact on the level of net interest income and net income we generate during that time 
in addition  the slope of the yield curve may change based on changes or expectations of changes in interest rates 
a flat to inverted yield curve could cause our net interest income and net interest margin to contract  which could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows  and the value of our assets 
see risks related to the legal and regulatory environment our earnings are significantly affected by government fiscal and monetary policies 
the strength and stability of other financial institutions may adversely affect our business 
the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions could affect our ability to engage in routine funding transactions 
financial services to institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
we have exposure to different industries and counterparties  and execute transactions with various counterparties in the financial industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may increase when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us 
any such losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents problems encountered by financial institutions larger or similar to us could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
concerns about  or a default or threatened default by  one or more major financial institutions could lead to significant market wide liquidity and credit problems  losses or defaults by other institutions 
this is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries  such as clearing agencies  clearing houses  banks  securities firms and exchanges  with which we and our subsidiaries interact on a daily basis  and therefore could adversely affect our business and the availability of products and services  as well as access to the credit and capital markets 
risks related to our business we are subject to credit risk 
our business strategy includes the origination of commercial and industrial loans and  to a lesser extent  cre loans  which are generally larger  and have higher risk adjusted returns and shorter maturities than one to four family mortgage loans 
our credit risk would ordinarily be expected to increase with the growth of these loan portfolios 
while we seek to reduce risks through our underwriting policies  which generally require that loans be qualified on the basis of the collateral  cash flows  appraised value  and debt service coverage ratio  among other factors  there can be no assurance that our underwriting policies will protect us from credit related losses or delinquencies 
we cannot guarantee that our record of asset quality will be maintained in future periods 
although we were not  and are not  involved in subprime or alt a residential mortgage lending  the lingering ramifications of the subprime lending crisis and the resulting turmoil in the financial and capital markets have been far reaching  with real estate values declining and unemployment remaining at elevated levels throughout the nation  including the regions we serve 
the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans could be adversely impacted by the significant change in market conditions or interest rates  which not only could result in our experiencing an increase in charge offs  but also could necessitate our increasing our provision for loan losses 
either of these events would have an adverse impact on our results of operations were they to occur 
our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in ohio  chicago  illinois  and western pennsylvania 
accordingly  the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans  and the value of the collateral securing such loans  may be significantly affected by economic conditions in the regions we serve or by changes in the local real estate markets 
a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation  changes in government fiscal and monetary policies  recession  unemployment  acts of terrorism  or other factors beyond our control could therefore have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see item business fiscal and monetary policies 
we are subject to certain risks in connection with the level of our allowance for loan losses 
a variety of factors could cause our borrowers to default on their loan payments and the collateral securing such loans to be insufficient to repay any remaining indebtedness 
in such an event  we could experience significant loan losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents in the process of originating a loan  we make various assumptions and judgments about the ability of the borrower to repay it  based on  among other factors i the cash flows produced by the building  property or business  ii the creditworthiness of the borrower  and iii the value of the real estate or other assets serving as collateral 
we also establish an allowance for loan losses through an assessment of probable losses in each of our loan portfolios 
several factors are considered in this process which involve numerous estimates and judgments  including i the level of defaulted loans at the close of each quarter  ii recent trends in loan performance  iii historical levels of loan losses  iv the factors underlying such loan losses and loan defaults  v projected default rates and loss severities  vi internal risk ratings  vii loan size  viii economic  industry  and environmental factors  ix impairment losses on individual loans  and x whether the loans are covered by loss sharing agreements with the fdic with respect to fdic assisted acquisitions 
if our assumptions and judgments regarding such matters prove to be incorrect  our allowance for loan losses might not be sufficient  and additional loan loss provisions might need to be made 
depending on the amount of such loan loss provisions  the adverse impact on our earnings could be material 
in addition  as our loan portfolio grows  it will generally be necessary to increase the allowance for loan losses through additional provisions  which would adversely impact our operating results 
furthermore  bank regulators may require us to make additional provision for loan losses or otherwise recognize further loan charge offs or impairments following their periodic reviews of our loan portfolio  our underwriting procedures and our loan loss allowance 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by such regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additional information regarding our allowance for loan losses is included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the sections captioned allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments and allowance for credit losses 
increases in fdic insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
the fdic maintains the dif to resolve the cost of bank failures 
the dif is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions  including firstmerit bank 
in  the fdic substantially modified fee assessments including changing the deposit insurance assessment base from total domestic deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity  as required by the dodd frank act  as well as the basis for assessing the risks charge components of such assessments 
we cannot provide assurance as to future changes in dif assessment rates or methodologies or their effects on us 
increases in dif assessment rates may materially adversely affect our results of operations  and the earning available to dividend to the corporation 
additional information regarding the fdic s proposed changes to dif assessment rates is provided in item business  in the section captioned regulation and supervision deposit insurance 
changes to rules relating to debit card interchange fees may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
pursuant to section of the dodd frank act the durbin interchange amendment  the federal reserve has issued rules relating to debit card interchange fees  network exclusivity and transaction routing 
specifically  the durbin interchange amendment directs the federal reserve board to establish standards for assessing whether the amount of any interchange fee that an issuer receives or charges with respect to a debit card transaction is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction 
the durbin interchange amendment directs the federal reserve to consider  when prescribing 
table of contents regulations  the functional similarity between debit card transactions and check transactions and to distinguish between the incremental cost incurred by the issuer for the issuer s role in the authorization  clearance  and settlement of a particular debit transaction  which shall be considered in setting the standard  and other costs incurred by an issuer that are not specific to a particular debit transaction  which shall not be considered in setting the standard 
the federal reserve adopted rules implementing the durbin interchange amendment effective october we have estimated that these rules decreased our revenue by million and million in and  respectively 
the recent repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense 
all federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were eliminated by the federal reserve repeal of regulation q  as authorized by the dodd frank act 
as a result  financial institutions may offer interest on demand deposits to compete for clients 
we do not yet know what interest rates other institutions may offer 
our interest expense could increase and our net interest margin will decrease if we begin offering interest on demand deposits to attract new customers or maintain current customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
the immediate effects of this change are reduced by currently low interest rates  and fdic guarantees of all transaction account balances  provided such accounts do not pay interest 
it is likely that our deposit cost will rise as a result of these changes  especially when short term interest rates increase  and following the expiration of the fdic transaction account guarantee program at the end of our business strategy includes planned growth 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively 
during  we undertook three significant acquisitions  which established a chicago footprint consisting of branch locations 
although we made no new acquisitions in  we continue to pursue a growth strategy both within our existing markets and in new markets 
following this strategy  in september  we agreed to acquire citizens 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies seeking significant growth 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations  even if only on a short term basis 
failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  future prospects  financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy 
also  if we grow more slowly than anticipated or fail to successfully integrate newly acquired operations  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
see risks relating to the citizens acquisition for more information 
our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors  including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities  the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas and our ability to integrate acquisitions and manage our growth 
while we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage future growth  there can be no assurance that growth opportunities will be available or  if available  that growth will be successfully managed 

table of contents we may experience difficulties in integrating acquired assets and expanding our operations into new geographic areas and markets 
the market areas in chicago  illinois served by the assets and branches we acquired during are areas in which we previously did not conduct significant banking activities 
similarly  citizens serves market areas where we do not conduct significant banking activities 
our ability to compete effectively in these new markets will depend on our ability to understand the local market and competitive dynamics and identify and retain key employees who know these markets 
we may also encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired operations with our operations and management 
our loans  deposits  fee businesses and employees have increased as a result of our organic growth and acquisitions 
our failure to successfully manage and support this growth with sufficient human resources  training and operational  financial and technology resources in challenging markets and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to sustain our historical growth rates 
see risks relating to the citizens acquisition for more information 
we face risks with respect to future expansion 
we may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future and we may engage in de novo branch expansion 
we may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services 
acquisitions and mergers involve a number of expenses and risks  including the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger targets  the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate and we may face risks of unknown contingent liabilities  the exposures to potential asset quality issues with respect acquired businesses  the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new offices  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion and unanticipated delays  our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders  the diversion of our management attention to the negotiation of a transaction  and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses  entry into new markets or products where we have limited experience  risks that growth will strain our infrastructure  staff  internal controls and management  which may require additional personnel  time and expenditures  the introduction of new products and services into our business  the creation and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition potential short term decreases in profitability  and the risk of loss of key employees and customers 
we may incur substantial costs to expand  and we can give no assurance such expansion including costs for transactions or new products that are unable to be completed or launched 
there can be no assurance that integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful 
also  we may issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions  which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders 
there is no assurance that  following any future mergers or acquisitions  our integration efforts 
table of contents will be successful or that  after giving effect to the acquisition  we will achieve profits comparable to or better than our historical experience 
we have made and may make additional fdic assisted acquisitions of failed banks  which could present additional risks to our business 
we have made two fdic assisted acquisitions  both with loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
as of december   total assets under loss sharing agreements  or covered assets  with the fdic was billion 
we may consider additional opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in fdic assisted transactions  which present the risks of acquisitions  generally  as well as some risk specific to these transactions 
although these fdic assisted transactions typically provide for fdic assistance to an acquiror to mitigate certain risks  which may include loss sharing agreements  where the fdic absorbs most losses on covered assets and provides some indemnity  we would be subject to many of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction  without fdic assistance  including risks associated with pricing such transactions  the risks of loss of deposits and maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the time frames we expect 
in addition  because these acquisitions provide for limited diligence and negotiation of terms  fdic assisted transactions may require additional resources and time  costs related to integration of personnel and operating systems  the establishment of processes and time required to service acquired assets including acquired problem loans  require us to raise additional capital  which may be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
loss sharing agreements with the fdic also involves additional reporting to and examination by the fdic of our performance under the loss sharing agreements 
loss sharing assets create volatility in earnings based on performance of assets covered by loss sharing agreements 
in general  the receivable from the fdic is reduced with an adverse effect on earnings as performance of covered assets improves versus expectations  which adversely affect our net income for the related periods 
if we are unable to manage these risks  fdic assisted acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face significant competition for loans and deposits 
we face significant competition for loans and deposits from other banks and financial institutions  both within and beyond our local marketplace 
within our region  we compete with commercial banks  savings banks  credit unions  and investment banks for deposits  and with the same financial institutions and others including mortgage brokers  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage houses for loans 
we also compete with companies that solicit loans and deposits over the internet 
many of our competitors including money center  national  and superregional banks have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we do  and may offer certain products and services that we do not offer 
because our profitability stems largely from our ability to attract deposits and originate loans  our continued ability to compete for depositors and borrowers is critical to our success 
our success as a competitor depends on a number of factors  including  but not limited to i our ability to develop  maintain  and build upon long term relationships with our customers by providing them with convenience  in the form of multiple branch locations and extended hours of service  ii access  in the form of alternative delivery channels  such as online banking  banking by phone  and atms  iii a broad and diverse selection of products and services  iv interest rates and service fees that compare favorably with those of our competitors  and v skilled and knowledgeable personnel to assist our customers with their financial needs 

table of contents external factors that may impact our ability to compete include changes in local economic conditions and real estate values  changes in interest rates and the consolidation of banks and thrifts within our marketplace 
we are subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity 
liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our operations and to fulfill our obligations  including commitments to originate loans  to repay our wholesale borrowings and other liabilities and to satisfy the withdrawal of deposits by our customers 
our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base  which is raised through our retail branch system 
core deposits comprised approximately of total deposits at december  additional available unused wholesale sources of liquidity include advances from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  issuances through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers  the internet and listing services 
liquidity is further provided by unencumbered  or unpledged  investment securities that totaled billion at december  an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale or pledging as collateral of loans and other assets could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
our access to liquidity sources could be reduced  among other things  in the event of a negative regulatory action against us  which could limit our use of brokered deposits or the rates we could pay on deposits 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole  as evidenced by recent turmoil in the domestic and worldwide credit markets 
basel iii proposals include liquidity requirements 
it is uncertain how or when these proposals may be implemented by our regulators and how such proposals will affect the corporation 
our liquidity on a parent only basis is affected by dividends available from our subsidiaries  primarily firstmerit bank 
at december   firstmerit bank could pay dividends of million without prior regulatory approval 
alternative sources of liquidity may be available to us in the markets from the sale of debt or equity  depending upon market conditions at the time 
the primary source of our income from which we pay dividends is the receipt of dividends from firstmerit bank  which is subject to regulatory restrictions on its payment of dividends 
the availability of dividends from firstmerit bank is limited by various statutes and regulations 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of firstmerit bank and other factors  that the occ could assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice 
in addition  the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiary s state of incorporation  and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries 
in the event that firstmerit bank was unable to pay dividends to us  we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our preferred and common shares 
our failure to pay dividends on our preferred shares and common shares could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 
additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in item business in the section captioned regulation and supervision dividends and transactions with affiliates 

table of contents we depend upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties  we may rely on information provided to us by customers and counterparties  including financial statements and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and  with respect to financial statements  on reports of independent auditors 
for example  in deciding whether to extend credit to a business  we may rely upon the customer s audited financial statements and their conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the customer 
the majority of our customers are comprised of consumers and small and medium sized businesses that may not have the same sophisticated internal controls and financial reporting systems as larger businesses 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with generally accepted accounting principles or that are materially misleading  or on other financial information that is inaccurate or incomplete 
derivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses 
we are party to a number of derivative transactions 
many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and non standardized  which can make exiting  transferring or settling the position difficult and potentially costly 
we carry borrowings which contain embedded derivatives 
these borrowing arrangements require that we deliver underlying securities to the counterparty as collateral 
if market interest rates were to decline  we may be required to deliver more securities to the counterparty 
we are dependent on the creditworthiness of the counterparties and are therefore susceptible to credit and operational risk in these situations 
derivative contracts and other transactions entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties on a timely basis 
while the transaction remains unconfirmed  we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and  in the event of a default  may find it more difficult to enforce the contract 
in addition  as new and more complex derivative products are created  covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments  disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise  which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs 
any regulatory effort to create an exchange or trading platform for credit derivatives and other over the counter derivative contracts  or a market shift toward standardized derivatives  could reduce the risk associated with such transactions  but under certain circumstances could also limit our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and ourselves and adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market being implemented under the dodd frank act may adversely affect our treatment of these transactions and increase our costs of engaging in derivative transactions 
we are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities 
in the normal course of business  we  as well as our subsidiaries  are routinely subject to examinations from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged 
recently  federal and state tax authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions 
these tax positions relate to various matters  such as tax compliance  sales and use  franchise  gross receipts  payroll  property and income tax issues  including tax base  apportionment and tax credit planning 
the challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income 
table of contents among tax jurisdictions 
if any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor  they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
loss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers 
our business is primarily relationship driven in that many of our key employees have extensive customer relationships 
loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor 
while we believe our relationship with our key producers is good  we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with our organization 
loss of such key personnel  should they enter into an employment relationship with one of our competitors  could result in the loss of some of our customers and potential adverse effects on our results of operations 
impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets could require charges to earnings  which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations 
under current accounting standards  goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indeterminate lives are not amortized but  instead  are assessed for impairment at least annually and when impairment indicators are present 
assessment of goodwill and such other intangible assets could result in circumstances where the applicable intangible asset is deemed to be impaired for accounting purposes 
under such circumstances  the intangible asset s impairment would be reflected as a charge to earnings in the period during which such impairment is identified 
we may be exposed to liability under nonsolicitation and noncompetition agreements to which one or more of our employees may be a party to with certain of our competitors 
from time to time  we may hire employees who may be parties to non solicitation or non competition agreements with one or more of our competitors 
although we expect that all such employees will comply with the terms of their non solicitation agreements  it is possible that if customers of our competitors choose to move their business to us  or employees of our competitor seek employment with us  even without any action on the part of any employee bound by any such agreement  that one or more of our competitors may choose to bring a claim against us and our employee 
such actions  at a minimum  will take time and involve costs to defend and resolve  and distract the employee from revenue producing work 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information  whether through a breach of our computer systems  including cyber attacks or otherwise  could severely harm our business 
as part of our business we collect  process  and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information 
despite the security measures we have in place  our facilities and systems  and those of our third party service providers  may be vulnerable to security breaches  cyber attacks  acts of vandalism  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors  or other similar events 
any security breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information  whether by us or by our vendors  could result in losses  severely damage our reputation  expose us to the risks of litigation and liability  disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
in addition  we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions  if any  or we may need to raise additional capital as a result of growth or losses 
our ability to raise additional capital will depend on our financial performance  conditions in the capital markets  economic conditions and a number of other factors  many of which are outside our control 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects consistent with changes in regulatory capital standard 
the federal reserve expects all bank holding companies contemplating significant expansion to operate with capital substantially above minimum capital levels 
basel iii and other regulatory actions are expected to require higher levels of capital 
under dodd frank and proposed bank rules  we will be required to perform periodic internal stress testing  which may result in increased capital needs depending on the risk indicated from the stress testing 
our organizational documents  state laws and regulated industry may discourage a third party from acquiring us by means of a tender offer  proxy contest or otherwise 
certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated code of regulations  certain laws of the state of ohio  and certain aspects of the bhca and other governing statutes and regulations  may have the effect of discouraging a tender offer or other takeover attempt not previously approved by our board of directors 
certain provisions in our charter documents and ohio law may prevent a change in management or a takeover attempt that you may consider to be in your best interest 
we are subject to chapter of the ohio revised code  which prohibits certain business combinations and transactions between an issuing public corporation and an ohio law interested shareholder for at least three years after the ohio law interested shareholder attains ownership  unless the board of directors of the issuing public corporation approves the transaction before the ohio law interest shareholder attains ownership 
we are also subject to section of the ohio revised code  which provides that certain notice and informational filings and special shareholder meeting and voting procedures must be followed prior to consummation of a proposed control share acquisition 
assuming compliance with the notice and information filings prescribed by the statute  a proposed control share acquisition may be made only if the acquisition is approved by a majority of the voting power of the issuer represented at the meeting and at least a majority of the voting power remaining after excluding the combined voting power of the interested shares 
certain provisions contained in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated code of regulations and ohio law could delay or prevent the removal of directors and other management and could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us that you may consider to be in your best interest more difficult 
for example  these provisions allow our board of directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval  limit who can call a special meeting of shareholders  and establish advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors 

table of contents these provisions  as well certain aspects of the bhca and other governing statutes and regulations  may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common shares at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common shares 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions  and increased nonbank competition could adversely affect us 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the transaction 
for example  consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  and increased competition for banking services could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 
we are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology 
communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business  as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships  our general ledger  our deposits  and our loans 
while we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures  interruptions  and security breaches  there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do 
in addition  any compromise of our security systems could deter customers from using our web site and our online banking service  both of which involve the transmission of confidential information 
although we rely on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data  these precautions may not protect our systems from all potential compromises or breaches of security 
in addition  we outsource certain of our data processing to certain third party providers 
if our third party providers encounter difficulties  or if we have difficulty in communicating with them  our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected  and our business operations could be adversely impacted 
threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel 
the occurrence of any systems failure  interruption  or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business  could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the provision of financial products and services has become increasingly technology driven 
our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively  and in a cost efficient manner  is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available 
many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology driven products and services 
the ability to keep pace with technological change is important  and the failure to do so on our part could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our business may be adversely impacted by acts of war or terrorism 
acts of war or terrorism could have a significant adverse impact on economic conditions and business activity generally  including inflation and therefore on our business 
such events could affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans  could impair the value and liquidity of the collateral securing our loans  and could cause significant property damage  thus increasing our expenses and or reducing our revenues 
in addition  such events could affect the ability of our depositors to maintain their deposits 
although we have established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business that  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our growth  financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to the citizens acquisition the success of our acquisition of citizens will depend on a number of uncertain factors 
consummation of our acquisition the acquisition  of citizens is subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals  including approvals of the federal reserve and the occ  and the satisfaction of other closing conditions 
the success of the acquisition will depend on a number of factors  including  without limitation the necessary regulatory approvals to consummate the acquisition not containing terms  conditions or restrictions that will be detrimental to  or have a material adverse effect on  the corporation or firstmerit bank  our ability to successfully integrate citizens into firstmerit current operations  including converting citizens products and systems to firstmerit products and services  our ability to retain citizens customers  and their loan  deposits and other businesses  the credit quality of loans and other assets acquired from citizens  our ability to retain appropriate citizens personnel in connection with the acquisition  our ability to attract new deposits and to generate new interest earning assets in citizens former markets without incurring unacceptable credit or interest rate risk  our ability to control noninterest expenses from citizens in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio  and our ability to earn acceptable levels of noninterest income  including fee income  from citizens former customers 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to integrate citizens successfully  that the acquisition will not expose us to unknown material liabilities  that the operation of citizens former business will not adversely affect our existing profitability  that we will be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business  that we will be able to compete effectively in new market areas  or that we will be able to manage growth resulting from the acquisition effectively 
the difficulties or costs we may encounter in the integration could materially and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

table of contents deposit and loan run off rates could be substantially different than what we have projected in connection with our planning for the acquisition and the integration of citizens 
deposit run off is expected to occur following the closing of the acquisition 
while we believe we assumed a reasonable deposit run off rate for purposes of valuing the transaction  actual run off could be higher 
similarly  we may lose loan relationships acquired in the acquisition 
we will need to convert citizens products and systems to our products and systems 
problems or errors in the customer account conversion process  and customer interface required to replace certain citizens products and services with comparable products and services of firstmerit bank  could adversely affect customer relationships  increase run off of deposit and loan customers and result in unexpected charges and costs 
similarly  run off could increase if we are not able to cost effectively service particular citizens loans  deposits or other products or services with special features 
an unanticipated increase in customer run off rates could increase the effective cost to us of the acquisition 
the credit quality of loans associated with the acquisition may be poorer than expected  which would require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and negatively affect our earnings 
on september   we and citizens entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement 
pursuant to the merger agreement  firstmerit bank will acquire citizens loans  which were approximately billion at september  as part of our due diligence on citizens  we reviewed samples of citizens loans and made estimated marks for credit and interest risks 
our examination of these loans was made using the same criteria  analysis and collateral evaluations that we have traditionally used in the ordinary course of our business 
however  no assurance can be given as to the future performance of citizens loans 
we face risks related to lending funds acquired in the acquisition 
our and firstmerit bank strategic plan focuses on the continued development and growth of a diversified loan portfolio  with emphasis on commercial loans made to borrowers within firstmerit bank market areas 
certain risks are inherent in the lending function  including a borrower inability to pay  insufficient collateral coverage and changes in interest rates 
repayment risk on commercial loans arises from changing economic conditions in particular geographic areas  businesses or industries that impair the operating performance of commercial borrowers 
risks associated with commercial real estate loans and general business loans also include changes in general economic conditions that affect underlying collateral values 
consumer loans also are subject to repayment risk and undercollateralization in the case of secured consumer loans caused by changing economic conditions 
termination of the merger agreement may negatively affect us 
if the merger agreement is terminated  we may suffer adverse consequences  including the adverse impact on our business due to the focus of management on the acquisition  without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the acquisition  as well as a decline in the market price for our securities including our subordinated notes  to the extent that the market price prior to termination reflects a market assumption that the acquisition will be completed 
the merger agreement also contains certain termination rights for both firstmerit and citizens  and further provides that  upon termination of the merger agreement under specified circumstances  a party would be required to pay to the other party a termination fee of million and the other party fees and expenses 
if the merger agreement is terminated  we will not purchase the citizens tarp preferred  and we will be required to redeem the subordinated notes we recently sold to finance the repurchase of the citizens tarp preferred 

table of contents we may fail to realize all the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
the success of the acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the our business and citizens and to combine our business and citizens in a manner that permits growth opportunities and cost savings to be realized without materially disrupting the existing customer relationships of citizens nor decreasing revenues due to loss of customers 
however  to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings  we must successfully combine our business and citizens business 
if we are not able to achieve these objectives  the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected 
we and citizens have operated and  until the completion of the acquisition  will continue to operate  independently 
it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees  the disruption of each company ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies  which could adversely affect the combined company ability to maintain relationships with clients  customers  depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
the anticipated cost savings from the acquisition are largely expected to derive from our absorption of many of citizens back office and other duplicative administrative functions 
it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees who may then receive severance benefits  the disruption of each company ongoing business that adversely affects our ability to maintain relationships with clients  customers  depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
integration efforts between the two companies will also require significant management attention and resources that will not be available for normal operations 
in addition  the acquisition and integration will result in us entering several markets where we do not currently have a meaningful presence and could result in deposit and other customer losses 
an expected benefit from the acquisition is an expected increase in the revenues of the combined company from anticipated sales of our wider variety of financial products and services  and from increased lending out of the combined company larger capital base and legal lending limits 
an inability to successfully market our products to citizens customer base could cause the earnings of the combined company to be less than anticipated 
integration matters and the transition to us could have an adverse effect on each of citizens and us during the pre acquisition transition period and on us for an undetermined period after consummation of the acquisition 
the acquisition is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us following the acquisition 
before the acquisition may be completed  various approvals or consents must be obtained from the federal reserve and the occ  which may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition or require changes to the terms of the acquisition 
such conditions or changes could delay completion of the acquisition or impose additional costs on us or limit our revenues following the acquisition and might have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations following the acquisition 
the occ approval of the acquisition is a condition to the acquisition 
we will be expanding our operations into new geographic areas 
portions of the market areas represented by citizens  including those in michigan and wisconsin  are areas in which we currently conduct limited or no banking activities 
in particular  citizens has significant operations in michigan  where we have a very limited presence 
we must effectively integrate these new markets to retain and expand the business currently conducted by citizens 
our ability to compete effectively in the new markets will be dependent on our ability to understand the local market and competitive dynamics and identify and retain employees from citizens who know their markets and customers better than we do 

table of contents risks related to the legal and regulatory environment our earnings are significantly affected by government fiscal and monetary policies 
banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings  and the interest received by a bank on its loans and securities holdings  constitutes the major portion of a bank earnings 
thus  the earnings and growth of the corporation and the bank are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally  both domestic and foreign  and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve 
the federal reserve regulates the supply of money through various means  including open market dealings in united states government securities  the discount rate at which banks may borrow from the federal reserve  and the reserve requirements on deposits 
in recent years  the federal reserve has taken extraordinary monetary actions 
the federal reserve has stated that it intends to keep the target federal funds rate at to and until unemployment and inflation reach targeted levels  and has engaged in major securities purchases and efforts to change the yield curve 
see item business fiscal and monetary policies 
the nature and timing of any changes in such policies and their effect on the corporation and the bank cannot be predicted 
new legislation  regulations and increased regulatory oversight may significantly affect our earnings and financial condition 
various legislative and regulatory proposals regarding substantial changes in banking  and the regulation of banks  thrifts and other financial institutions  and the regulation of financial markets and their participants and financial instruments  and the regulators of all of these  as well as the taxation of these entities  are being considered by the executive branch of the federal government  congress and various state governments  including states where we operate 
extensive rulemaking is required by the dodd frank act  which is only partially completed  and where continuing new rules and changes are expected 
certain of these proposals  if adopted  could significantly change the regulation or operations of banks and the financial services industry 
new regulations and statutes are regularly proposed that contain wide ranging proposals for altering the structures  regulations and competitive relationships of the nation financial institutions 
the dodd frank act may adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states 
there are a number of reform provisions that are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks and bank holding companies  including us and firstmerit bank  do business 
for example  the dodd frank act changes the assessment base for federal deposit insurance premiums by modifying the deposit insurance assessment base calculation to equal a depository institution consolidated assets less tangible capital and permanently increases the standard maximum amount of deposit insurance per customer to  the dodd frank act creates the consumer financial protection bureau as a new agency empowered to promulgate new and revise existing consumer protection regulations which may limit certain consumer fees or otherwise significantly change fee practices 
the dodd frank act also imposes more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies by  among other things  imposing leverage ratios on bank holding companies and prohibiting new trust preferred issuances from counting as tier i capital 
the dodd frank act also repeals the federal prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction 
table of contents and other accounts 
other significant changes from provisions of the dodd frank act include  but are not limited to i changes to rules relating to debit card interchange fees  ii new comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  iii reform related to the regulation of credit rating agencies  iv restrictions on the ability of banks to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds  and v the implementation of a number of new corporate governance provisions  including  but not limited to  requiring companies to claw back incentive compensation under certain circumstances  providing shareholders the opportunity to cast a non binding vote on executive compensation  new executive compensation disclosure requirements and considerations regarding the independence of compensation advisors 
many provisions of the dodd frank act have yet to be implemented and will require interpretation and rulemaking by federal regulators 
we are closely monitoring all relevant sections of the dodd frank act to ensure continued compliance with laws and regulations 
while the ultimate effect of the dodd frank act on us cannot currently be determined  the law and its implementing rules and regulations are likely to result in increased compliance costs and fees paid to regulators  along with possible restrictions on our operations  all of which may have a material adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition 
our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising in foreclosure practices  including delays in the foreclosure process  related to certain industry deficiencies  as well as potential losses in connection with actual or projected repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages sold into the secondary market 
deficiencies in foreclosure documentation by several large seller servicer financial institutions and related settlements and regulatory enforcement actions as well as state attorney generals regulatory agencies have raised various concerns relating to mortgage foreclosure practices in the united states 
the integrity of the foreclosure process is important to our business  as an originator and servicer of residential mortgages  in our primary markets in ohio  illinois and pennsylvania 
we service loans for fannie mae and freddie mac 
we have reviewed our foreclosure procedures and concluded they do not present the significant documentation deficiencies underlying other industry foreclosure problems 
nevertheless  we could face delays and challenges in the foreclosure process arising from claims relating to industry practices generally  which could adversely affect recoveries and our financial results  whether through increased expenses of litigation and property maintenance  deteriorating values of underlying mortgaged properties or unsuccessful litigation results generally 
as it relates to loans sold by our residential mortgage lending business  we may be required to repurchase some of those loans or indemnify the loan purchaser for damages caused by a breach of the loan sale agreement 
although we believe that our mortgage documentation and procedures have been appropriate  it is possible that we will receive repurchase requests from our mortgage purchasers  including fannie mae and freddie mac in the future and we may not be able to reach favorable settlements with respect to such requests 
it is therefore possible that we may increase our reserves or may sustain losses associated with such loan repurchases and indemnification payments 
as of december   the amount of our mortgage repurchase reserves was million 
environmental liability associated with commercial lending could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
in addition  we own and operate certain properties that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although we have policies and procedures requiring the performance of an environmental site assessment before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these assessments may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have been and will continue to be the subject of litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to our business and reputation 
from time to time  we may be subject to claims or legal action from customers  employees and or others 
financial institutions like firstmerit are facing a growing number of significant class actions  including claims based on the manner of calculation of interest on loans and the assessment of overdraft fees 
past  present and future litigation have included or could include claims for substantial compensatory and or punitive damages  disgorgement of previously earned  current or future profits  or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages 
we are also involved from time to time in other reviews  investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding our business 
these matters also could result in adverse judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  injunctions or other relief 
like other large financial institutions  we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct  including non compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations and or cause significant reputational harm to our business 
additional information regarding litigation is included in note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements and in item legal proceedings

non gaap financial measures the table below presents computations of earnings loss and certain other financial measures including tangible common equity  tier common equity  tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio  basel iii tier common ratio  fee income ratio and efficiency ratio  all of which are non gaap measures 
the table below also reconciles the us gaap performance measures to the corresponding non gaap measures 
management believes these non gaap financial measures enhance an investor understanding of the business by providing a meaningful base for period to period comparisons  assisting in operating results analysis  and predicting future performance on the same basis as applied by management and the board of directors 
management and the board of directors utilize these non gaap financial measures as follows preparation of operating budgets monthly financial performance reporting monthly  quarterly and year to date assessment of the corporation business monthly close out reporting of consolidated results management only presentations to investors of corporate performance 
table of contents tangible common equity ratios have been a focus of some investors in analyzing the capital position of the corporation absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock 
traditionally  the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company bhc capital adequacy based on tier capital  the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations 
in connection with the federal reserve comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process  these regulators are supplementing their assessment of the capital adequacy of a bank based on a variation of tier capital  known as tier common equity 
while not codified  analysts and banking regulators have assessed the corporation capital adequacy using the tangible common shareholders equity and or the tier common equity measure 
because tangible common equity and tier common equity are not formally defined by us gaap or codified in the federal banking regulations  these measures are considered to be non gaap financial measures and other entities may calculate them differently than the corporation disclosed calculations 
since analysts and banking regulators may assess the corporation capital adequacy using tangible common shareholders equity and tier common equity  management believes that it is useful to provide investors information enabling them to assess the corporation capital adequacy on these same bases 
tier common equity is often expressed as a percentage of risk weighted assets 
under the risk based capital framework  a bank balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk categories 
the aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weighting assigned to that category 
the resulting weighted values from each of the four categories are added together and this sum is the risk weighted assets total that  as adjusted  comprises the denominator of certain risk based capital ratios 
tier capital is then divided by this denominator risk weighted assets to determine the tier capital ratio 
adjustments are made to tier capital to arrive at tier common equity non gaap 
tier common equity is also divided by the risk weighted assets to determine the tier common equity ratio 
the amounts disclosed as risk weighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements 
the corporation currently calculates its risk based capital ratios under guidelines adopted by the federal reserve based on the capital accord basel i of the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee 
in december  the basel committee released its final framework for basel iii  which will strengthen international capital and liquidity regulation 
when implemented by us bank regulatory agencies and fully phased in  basel iii will change capital requirements and place greater emphasis on common equity 
the us bank regulatory agencies have not yet adopted final regulations governing the implementation of basel iii 
accordingly  the calculations provided below are estimates  based on the corporation current understanding of the framework  including the corporation reading of the requirements  and informal feedback received through the regulatory process 
the corporation understanding of the framework is evolving and will likely change as the regulations are finalized 
because the basel iii implementation regulations are not formally defined by us gaap and have not yet been finalized and codified  these measures are considered to be non gaap financial measures  and other entities may calculate them differently from the corporation disclosed calculations 
since analysts and banking regulators may assess the corporation capital adequacy using the basel iii framework  management believes that it is useful to provide investors information enabling them to assess the corporation capital adequacy on the same basis 
the efficiency ratio non gaap  which is a measure of productivity  is generally calculated as other expense divided by total revenue on a taxable equivalent basis 
the fee income ratio non gaap is generally calculated as other income divided by total revenue 
management uses these ratios to monitor performance and believes these measures provide meaningful information to investors 
other expense may be presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted other expense non gaap  which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio 
other income may be presented excluding adjustments to arrive at adjusted other income non gaap  which is the numerator for the fee income ratio 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis non 
table of contents gaap and other income are added together to arrive at total adjusted revenue non gaap 
adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue non gaap  which is the denominator for the fee income and efficiency ratios 
it is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur  however  management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations 
non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited 
although these non gaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under gaap 
these non gaap measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be represented by other companies

management reviews this measure along with other measures of capital as part of its internal financial analysis 
estimate based on june us notices of proposed rulemaking 
under basel iii  regulatory capital must be reduced by purchased credit card relationship intangible assets 
these assets are partially allowed in basel i capital 
these include adjustments to other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges  disallowed deferred tax assets  threshold deductions and other adjustments 
firstmerit continues to develop systems and internal controls to calculate risk weighted assets as required by basel iii 
the amount included above is a reasonable approximation  based on our understanding of the requirements

table of contents results of operations net interest income net interest income  the corporation principal source of earnings  is the difference between interest income generated by earning assets primarily loans and investment securities and interest paid on interest bearing funds namely customer deposits and wholesale borrowings 
net interest income is affected by market interest rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of earning assets being funded by interest bearing liabilities  noninterest bearing liabilities  the mix of funding between interest bearing liabilities  noninterest bearing liabilities and equity  and the growth in earning assets 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for year ended december  and million for the year ended december  for the purpose of this remaining discussion  net interest income is presented on a fte basis  to provide a comparison among all types of interest earning assets 
that is  interest on tax free securities and tax exempt loans has been restated as if such interest were taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of adjusted for the non deductible portion of interest expense incurred to acquire the tax free assets 
net interest income presented on a fte basis is a financial measure that is calculated and presented other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap and is widely used by financial services organizations 
therefore  management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons 
the fte adjustment for full year was million compared with million in and million in net interest income presented on an fte basis decreased million or to million in compared to million in and million in 
table of contents the impact of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and interest rates on net interest income is illustrated in the following table

the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income fte by average earning assets 
as with net interest income  the net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of earning assets  the proportion of earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate spread

investment securities at december   total investment securities were billion compared to billion at december  available for sale securities were billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
available for sale securities are held primarily for liquidity  interest rate risk management and long term yield enhancement 
accordingly  the corporation investment policy is to invest in securities with low credit risk  such as us treasury securities  us government agency obligations  state and political obligations  mortgage backed securities mbss and corporate bonds 
held to maturity securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  and consist principally of securities issued by state and political subdivisions 
available for sale securities decreased million year over year while held to maturity securities increased million 
this movement in the investment portfolio was in response to potential future changes in regulatory capital rules 
other investments consist primarily of fhlb and federal reserve bank frb stock and totaled million at december  and as part of an investment portfolio repositioning strategy implemented in the second half of  the lowest yielding securities in the portfolio were sold  with a portion of the proceeds being used to pay down high cost wholesale funding  and the remaining proceeds being invested into higher yielding securities 
net realized gains of million and million were recognized during the years ended december  and  respectively  from the sale of available for sale securities as a result of the aforementioned activities 
net unrealized gains on the investment securities portfolio were million at december   compared to million at december  
table of contents the corporation conducts a regular assessment of its investment securities to determine whether any securities are other than temporarily impaired 
only the credit portion of other than temporary impairment otti is recognized in current earnings for those securities where there is no intent to sell or it is more likely than not the corporation would not be required to sell the security prior to expected recovery 
the remaining portion of otti is to be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of income tax 
gross unrealized losses of million as of december   compared to million at december  were concentrated within trust preferred securities held in the investment portfolio 
the corporation holds eight  single issuer  trust preferred securities 
such investments are less than of the fair value of the entire investment portfolio 
none of the bank issuers have deferred paying dividends on their issued trust preferred shares in which the corporation is invested 
the fair values of these investments have been impacted by market conditions  which have caused risk premiums to increase resulting in the decline in the fair value of the corporation trust preferred securities 
further detail of the composition of the securities portfolio and discussion of the results of the most recent otti assessment are in note investment securities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
loans loans acquired under loss share agreements with the fdic include the amounts of expected reimbursements from the fdic and are presented as covered loans below 
loans not subject to loss share agreements are presented below as noncovered loans 
acquired loans are initially measured at fair value as of the acquisition date 
fair value measurements include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows 
credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loan are also a component of the initial fair value  therefore  an allowance for loan losses is not recorded at the acquisition date 
total noncovered loans outstanding at december  increased million or to billion compared to billion as of december  this increase was driven primarily by higher commercial loans which increased in due to the corporation expansion into the chicago  illinois area 
this growth was also attributable to increases in asset based lending as well as new business within the capital markets and healthcare lines of business 
while the corporation is adding new commercial loans in both its core ohio and newer chicago  illinois markets  low credit line utilization by existing customers is mitigating new loan production with respect to the overall portfolio balances 
residential mortgage loans are originated and then sold into the secondary market or held in portfolio 
low interest rates during contributed to an increase in mortgage loan originations  particularly refinancing activity 
total residential mortgage loan balances increased million or year over year as a larger amount of shorter maturity and adjustable rate mortgages were held in portfolio compared to the prior year 
outstanding home equity loans increased million or from installment loans increased million or from december total covered loans  including the loss share receivable  decreased from december  by million or 
the covered loan portfolio will continue to decline  through payoffs  charge offs  termination or expiration of loss share coverage  unless the corporation acquires additional loans subject to loss share agreements in the future 

table of contents the following table breaks down outstanding loans by category 
there is no predominant concentration of loans in any particular industry or group of industries 
at december  in thousands commercial residential mortgage installment home equity credit card leases total noncovered loans less allowance for noncovered loan losses net noncovered loans covered loans less allowance for covered loan losses net covered loans net loans the corporation has approximately billion of loans secured by real estate 
approximately of the property underlying these loans is located within the corporation primary market area of ohio  western pennsylvania  and chicago  illinois 
the corporation evaluates acquired loans for impairment in accordance with the provisions of asc  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality asc 
acquired loans are considered impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and if it is probable all contractually required payments will not be collected 
expected cash flows at the purchase date in excess of the fair value of acquired impaired loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable 
subsequent to the purchase date  increases in cash flows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively 
the present value of any decreases in expected cash flows after the purchase date is recognized as a provision for loans losses net of any expected reimbursement under any loss share agreements 
revolving loans  including lines of credit and credit cards loans  and leases are excluded from acquired impaired loan accounting 
a loss share receivable is recorded at the acquisition date which represents the estimated fair value of reimbursement the corporation expects to receive under any loss share agreements 
the fair value measurement reflects counterparty credit risk and other uncertainties 
the loss share receivable continues to be measured on the same basis as the related indemnified loans 
deterioration in the credit quality of the loans recorded as an adjustment to the allowance for covered loan losses would immediately increase the basis of the loss share receivable  with the offset recorded through the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income 
increases in the credit quality or cash flows of loans reflected as an adjustment to yield and accreted into income over the remaining life of the loans decrease the basis of the loss share receivable  with such decrease being accreted into income over the same period or the life of the loss share agreements  whichever is shorter 
loss assumptions used in the basis of the loss share receivable are consistent with the loss assumptions used to measure the related covered loans 

table of contents all loans acquired in the first bank acquisition were performing as of the date of acquisition and  therefore  the difference between the fair value and the outstanding balance of these loans is being accreted to interest income over the remaining term of the loans 
in  the bank acquired million and billion of loans in conjunction with the fdic assisted acquisitions of george washington and midwest  respectively 
all loans acquired in the george washington and midwest acquisitions were acquired with loss share agreements 
the corporation has elected to account for all loans acquired in the george washington and midwest acquisitions as impaired loans under asc acquired impaired loans except for million of acquired loans with revolving privileges  which are outside the scope of this guidance  and which are being accounted for in accordance with asc acquired non impaired loans 
interest income  through accretion of the difference between the carrying amount of the acquired impaired loans and the expected cash flows  is recognized on all acquired impaired loans 
the difference between the fair value of the acquired non impaired loans and their outstanding balances is being accreted to interest income over the remaining period the revolving lines are in effect

the corporation and the bank regularly analyze the adequacy of their allowance through ongoing review of trends in risk ratings  delinquencies  nonperforming assets  charge offs  economic conditions  and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
notes summary of significant accounting policies and loans and allowance for loan losses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements provide detailed information regarding the corporation credit policies and practices 
the corporation uses a vendor based loss migration model to forecast losses for commercial loans 
the model creates loss estimates using twelve month monthly rolling vintages and calculates cumulative three years loss rates within two different scenarios 
one scenario uses five year historical performance data while the other one uses two year historical data 
the calculated rate is the average cumulative expected loss of the two and five year data set 
as a result  this approach lends more weight to the more recent performance 
management also considers internal and external factors such as economic conditions  loan management practices  portfolio monitoring  and other risks  collectively known as qualitative factors or q factors  to 
table of contents estimate credit losses in the loan portfolio 
q factors are used to reflect changes in the portfolio collectability characteristics not captured by historical loss data 
acquired loans are recorded at acquisition date at their acquisition date fair values  and  therefore  are excluded from the calculation of loan loss reserves as of the acquisition date 
to the extent there is a decrease in the present value of cash flows from acquired impaired loans after the date of acquisition  the corporation records an allowance for loan losses  net of expected reimbursement under any loss share agreements 
these expected reimbursements are recorded as part of covered loans in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
during the year ended december   the corporation increased its allowance for covered loan losses to million to reserve for estimated additional losses on certain acquired impaired loans 
the increase in the allowance was recorded by a charge to the provision for covered loan losses of million and an increase of million in the loss share receivable for the portion of the losses recoverable under the loss share agreements 
for acquired loans that are not deemed impaired at acquisition  credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loan are a component of the initial fair value 
subsequent to the purchase date  the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for these loans is similar to originated loans  however  the corporation records a provision for loan losses only when the required allowance  net of any expected reimbursement under any loss share agreements  exceeds any remaining credit discounts 
the allowance for loan losses on acquired non impaired loans was million and million as of december  and  respectively  and is included in the allowance for noncovered loan losses on the consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the allowance for noncovered loan losses was million or of noncovered loans outstanding  compared to million or at december  the allowance equaled of nonperforming loans at december  compared to at december  the additional reserves related to qualitative risk factors totaled million at december  and million at december  nonperforming assets have decreased by million over primarily attributable to the improving economic conditions and extensive loan work out activities 
net charge offs on noncovered loans were million in compared to million in and million in as a percentage of average noncovered loans outstanding  net charge offs equaled in  in and in losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses as soon as they are identified 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at december  and was million and million  respectively 
binding unfunded lending commitments include items such as letters of credit  financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments 
the allowance for credit losses  which includes both the allowance for noncovered loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments  amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively

successful management of credit risk requires making good underwriting decisions  carefully administering the loan portfolio and diligently collecting delinquent accounts 
the corporation credit policy division manages credit risk by establishing common credit policies for its subsidiaries  participating in approval of their largest loans  conducting reviews of their loan portfolios  providing them with centralized consumer underwriting  collections and loan operations services  and overseeing their loan workouts 
the corporation objective is to minimize losses from its commercial lending activities and to maintain consumer losses at acceptable levels that are stable and consistent with growth and profitability objectives 
individual commercial loans are assigned credit risk grades based on an internal assessment of conditions that affect a borrower ability to meet its contractual obligation under the loan agreement 
the assessment process 
table of contents includes reviewing a borrower current financial information  historical payment experience  credit documentation  public information  and other information specific to each borrower 
commercial loans are reviewed on an annual  quarterly or rotational basis or as management becomes aware of information during a borrower ability to fulfill its obligation 
for consumer loans  management evaluates credit quality based on the aging status of the loan as well as by payment activity  which is presented in the above tables

noncovered loans past due days or more but still accruing interest are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest and are in the process of collection 
at december   accruing noncovered loans days or more past due totaled million compared to million at december  credit card loans on which payments are past due for days are placed on nonaccrual status 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest deemed uncollectible which had been accrued in prior years is charged against the allowance for loan losses and interest deemed uncollectible accrued in the current year is reversed against interest income 
interest on mortgage loans is accrued until management deems it uncollectible based upon the specific identification method 
payments subsequently received on nonaccrual loans are generally applied to principal 
a loan is returned to accrual status when principal and interest are no longer past due and collectability is probable 
this generally requires timely principal and interest payments for a minimum of six consecutive payment cycles 
loans are generally written off when deemed uncollectible or when they reach a predetermined number of days past due depending upon loan product  terms  and other factors

loan impairment for all loans is measured based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan effective interest rate  at the observable market price of the loan  or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
impaired loans include all nonaccrual commercial  agricultural  construction  and commercial real estate loans  and loans modified as troubled debt restructurings 
table of contents tdrs 
in certain circumstances  the corporation may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near term 
in most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate  extension of the maturity date or modification of the adjustable rate provisions of the loan that would otherwise not be considered 
concessionary modifications are classified as tdrs unless the modification is short term to days and considered to be an insignificant delay while awaiting additional information from the borrower 
all amounts due  including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate  are expected to be collected 
tdrs return to accrual status once the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles 
a sustained period of repayment performance would be a minimum of six consecutive payment cycles from the date of restructure

we restructure residential mortgages in a variety of ways to help our clients remain in their homes and to mitigate the potential for additional losses 
the primary restructuring methods being offered to our residential clients are reductions in interest rates and extensions in terms 
modifications of mortgages retained in portfolio are handled using proprietary modification guidelines  or the fdic modification program for residential first mortgages covered by loss share agreements 
the corporation participates in the us treasury home affordable modification program for originated mortgages sold to and serviced for fannie mae and freddie mac 
in addition  the corporation has also modified certain loans according to provisions in loss share agreements 
losses associated with modifications on these loans  including the economic impact of interest rate reductions  are generally eligible for reimbursement under the loss share agreements

capital adequacy capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance 
the corporation maintained a strong capital position with tangible common equity to assets of at december   compared with at december  financial institutions are subject to a strict uniform system of capital based regulations 
under this system  there are five different categories of capitalization  with prompt corrective actions and significant operational restrictions imposed on institutions that are capital deficient under the categories 
the five categories are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier capital ratio of at least  a leverage capital ratio of at least  and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level 
an adequately capitalized institution has a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least and a leverage capital ratio of at least 
institutions with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  depending on their actual capital levels 
the appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade an institution to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound practice 
institutions are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category 
the george washington and midwest fdic assisted acquisitions resulted in the recognition of loss share receivables from the fdic  which represents the fair value of estimated future payments by the fdic to the corporation for losses on covered assets

risk management market risk management market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices  including the correlation among these factors and their volatility 
when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors  the holder faces market risk 
the corporation is primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to its customers 
interest rate risk management changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the corporation financial instruments  cash flows  and net interest income 
the corporation seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates 
the asset and liability committee alco oversees market risk management  establishing risk measures  limits  and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital 
according to these policies  responsibility for measuring and the management of interest rate risk resides in the corporate treasury function 
interest rate risk on the corporation balance sheets consists of reprice  option  and basis risks 
reprice risk results from differences in the maturity  or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
option risk arises from embedded options present in the investment portfolio and in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options  and interest rate options 
these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change  which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the corporation 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship 
table of contents between market rates or indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of profit spread on an earning asset or liability 
basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities  such as interest bearing checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates 
the interest rate risk position is measured and monitored using risk management tools  including earnings simulation modeling and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis  which capture both near term and long term interest rate risk exposures 
combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of short term and long term interest rate risk in the corporation 
net interest income simulation analysis 
earnings simulation involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios including shocks  gradual ramps  curve flattening  curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rates scenarios 
presented below is the corporation interest rate risk profile as of december  and immediate change in rates and resulting percentage increase decrease in net interest income basis points basis points basis points basis points december  december  modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process 
to the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed  actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected 
the assumptions used in the models are management best estimate based on studies conducted by the alco department 
the alco department uses a data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various ad hoc reports to refine assumptions continuously 
assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities eg  savings  money market and interest bearing checking accounts  balance trends  and repricing relationships reflect management best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed regularly 
economic value of equity modeling 
the corporation also has longer term interest rate risk exposure  which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis 
alco uses economic value of equity eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital 
eve involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on balance sheet and off balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents the corporation economic value of equity 
the analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario  which will impact the discounted present value 
the amount of base case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet 

table of contents presented below is the corporation eve profile as of december  and immediate change in rates and resulting percentage increase decrease in eve basis points basis points basis points basis points december  december  management reviews and takes appropriate action if this analysis indicates that the corporation eve will change by more than in response to an immediate basis point increase in interest rates or eve will change by more than in response to an immediate basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the corporation is operating within these guidelines 
interest rate sensitivity analysis 
the corporation analyzes the historical sensitivity of its interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion that it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year 
the following analysis divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap between maturing assets and liabilities in each category 
the analysis shows that assets maturing within one year exceed liabilities maturing within the same period by billion 
focusing on estimated repricing activity within one year  the corporation was in an asset sensitive position at december  as illustrated in the following table 
days days days days days over year total in thousands interest earning assets loans and leases investment securities and federal funds sold total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand interest bearing savings and money market accounts certificate and other time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase wholesale borrowings total interest bearing liabilities total gap cumulative gap management of interest rate exposure 
management uses the results of its various simulation analysis to formulate strategies to achieve desired risk profile within the parameters of the corporation capital and liquidity guidelines 
specifically  management actively manages interest rate risk positions by using derivatives predominately in the form of interest rate swaps  which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 
for more information about how the corporation uses interest rate swaps to manage its balance sheet  see note summary of significant accounting policies and note derivatives and hedging activity in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the possibility of the corporation being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
liquidity is managed to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit  deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities 
the corporation considers core earnings  strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings  which allow the corporation cost effective access to market based liquidity 
the corporation relies on a large  stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk 
the treasury group is responsible for identifying  measuring and monitoring the corporation liquidity profile 
the position is evaluated daily  weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources  reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future month and identifying sources and uses of funds 
the overall management of the corporation liquidity position is also integrated into retail deposit pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base 
the corporation primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through its retail branch system 
core deposits comprised approximately of total deposits at december  the corporation also has available unused wholesale sources of liquidity  including advances from the fhlb of cincinnati  issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers 
liquidity is further provided by unencumbered  or unpledged  investment securities that totaled billion at december  the treasury group also prepares a contingency funding plan that details the potential erosion of funds in the event of a systemic financial market crisis or institutional specific stress 
an example of an institution specific event would be a downgrade in the corporation public credit rating by a rating agency due to factors such as deterioration in asset quality  a large charge to earnings  a decline in profitability or other financial measures  or a significant merger or acquisition 
examples of systemic events unrelated to the corporation that could have an effect on its access to liquidity would be terrorism or war  natural disasters  political events  or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation  mutual fund or hedge fund 
similarly  market speculation or rumors about the corporation or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 
the liquidity contingency plan therefore outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis 
the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions 
it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period 
parent company liquidity the corporation manages its liquidity principally through dividends from the bank 
the corporation has sufficient liquidity to service its debt  support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner and without adverse consequences  and pay dividends to shareholders 
during the year ended december   the bank paid million in dividends to the corporation 
as of december   the bank had an additional million available to pay dividends without regulatory approval 
any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors  subject to applicable limitations under federal and ohio law  and will be dependent upon our results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors

table of contents recent market and regulatory developments 
in response to the current national and international economic recession  and in efforts to stabilize and strengthen the financial markets and banking industries  the united states congress and governmental agencies have taken a number of significant actions over the past several years  including the passage of legislation and implementation of a number of programs 
the most recent of these actions was the passage into law  on july   of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act is the most comprehensive change to banking laws and the financial regulatory environment since the great depression of the s 
the dodd frank act affects almost every aspect of the nation financial services industry and mandates change in several key areas  including regulation and compliance both with respect to financial institutions and systemically important nonbank financial companies  securities regulation  executive compensation  regulation of derivatives  corporate governance  and consumer protection 
in this respect  it is noteworthy that preemptive rights heretofore granted to national banking associations by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ under the national bank act will diminish with respect to consumer financial laws and regulations 
thus  congress has authorized states to enact their own substantive protections and to allow state attorneys general to initiate civil actions to enforce federal consumer protections 
in this respect  the corporation will be subject to regulation by a new consumer protection bureau known as the bureau of consumer financial protection the bureau under the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve 
the bureau will consolidate enforcement currently undertaken by myriad financial regulatory agencies  and will have substantial power to define the rights of consumers and responsibilities of providers  including the corporation 
in addition  and among many other legislative changes as a result of the dodd frank act that the corporation will assess  the corporation experienced a new assessment model from the fdic based on assets  not deposits  will be subject to enhanced executive compensation and corporate governance requirements  and will be able  for the first time to offer interest on business transaction and other accounts 
the extent to which the dodd frank act and initiatives thereunder will succeed in addressing the credit markets or otherwise result in an improvement in the national economy is not yet known 
in addition  because most aspects of this legislation will be subject to intensive agency rulemaking and subsequent public comment prior to implementation  it is difficult to predict at this time the ultimate effect of the dodd frank act on the corporation 
it is likely  however  that the corporation expenses will increase as a result of new compliance requirements 
in december  the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation basel iii 
minimum global liquidity standards under basel iii are meant to ensure banks maintain adequate levels of liquidity on both a short and medium to longer horizon 
expected liquidity standard implementation dates are january  and january  when implemented by the federal banking agencies and fully phased in  basel iii will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital  with a greater emphasis on common equity 
when fully phased in on january   basel iii will require banking institutions to maintain heightened tier common equity  tier capital and total capital ratios  as well as maintaining a capital conservation buffer 
regulations by the federal banking agencies implementing basel iii are expected to be proposed in mid  with adoption of final regulations unknown 
notwithstanding its release of the basel iii framework as a final framework  the basel committee is considering further amendments to basel iii  including imposition of additional capital surcharges on globally systemically important financial institutions 
in addition to basel iii  the dodd frank act requires or permits federal banking 
table of contents agencies to adopt regulations affecting capital requirements in a number of respects  including potentially more stringent capital requirements for systemically important financial institutions 
accordingly  the regulations ultimately applicable to the corporation may differ substantially from the currently published final basel iii framework 
requirements of higher capital levels or higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the corporation net income and return on equity 
various legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry will likely continue to be introduced in congress  and such legislation may further change banking statutes and the operating environment of the corporation and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways  and could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance depending upon whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that it or any implementing regulations  would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries 
with the enactment of the dodd frank act  the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions remains very unpredictable 
to the extent that the previous information describes statutory and regulatory provisions applicable to the corporation or its subsidiaries  it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of those provisions 
also  such statutes  regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies and are subject to change at any time  particularly in the current economic and regulatory environment 
any such change in statutes  regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the corporation could have a material effect on the business of the corporation

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the corporation has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in its consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the corporation significant obligations at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  as referenced in the table payments due in financial statement note reference total one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years in thousands deposits without a stated maturity a consumer and brokered certificates of deposits a federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements long term debt operating leases b capital lease obligations c purchase obligations c reserves for uncertain tax positions d total a excludes interest 
b the corporation operating lease obligations represent commitments under noncancelable operating leases on branch facilities 
c there were no material purchase or capital lease obligations outstanding at december  d gross unrecognized income tax benefits 
commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the following table details the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments and off balance sheet arrangements as of december  additionally details of these commitments are provided in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  as referenced in the following table payments due in financial statement note reference total one year or less one to three years three to five years over five years in thousands commitments to extend credit e standby letters of credit loans sold with recourse postretirement benefits f total e commitments to extend credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
f the postretirement benefit payments represent actuarially determined future benefits to eligible plan participants 
accounting standards require that the liability be recorded at net present value while the future payments contained in this table have not been discounted 

table of contents critical accounting policies the corporation consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates 
all accounting policies are important  and all policies described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements provide a greater understanding of how the corporation financial performance is recorded and reported 
some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a significant effect on the corporation financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility 
the policies require management to exercise judgment and make certain assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
these assumptions and estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
management relies heavily on the use of judgment  assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions  including accounting for the allowance for loan losses  income taxes  derivative instruments and hedging activities  and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies 
a brief discussion of each of these areas follows 
acquired loans loans acquired are initially recorded at their acquisition date fair values 
the carryover of an allowance for loan losses is prohibited as any credit losses in the loans are included in the determination of the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date 
fair values for acquired loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  liquidity risk  default rates  loss severity  payment speeds  collateral values and discount rate 
acquired loans are evaluated for impairment and are considered impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and if it is probable that not all contractually required payments will be collected 
in the assessment of credit quality  numerous assumptions  interpretations and judgments must be made  based on internal and third party credit quality information and ultimately the determination as to the probability that all contractual cash flows will not be able to be collected 
this is a point in time assessment and inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment involved 
expected cash flows at the purchase date in excess of the fair value of acquired impaired loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable 
subsequent to the purchase date  increases in cash flows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively 
the present value of any decreases in expected cash flows after the purchase date is recognized as a provision for loans losses net of expected reimbursement under any loss share agreements 
revolving loans  including lines of credit and credit cards loans  and leases are excluded from acquired impaired loan accounting 
for acquired loans that are not deemed impaired at acquisition  credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loan are a component of the initial fair value 
subsequent to the purchase date  the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for these loans is similar to originated loans  however  the corporation records a provision for loan losses only when the required allowance  net of expected reimbursement under any loss share agreements exceeds any remaining credit discounts 

table of contents a loss share receivable is recorded at the acquisition date which represents the estimated fair value of reimbursement the corporation expects to receive from the fdic for incurred losses on certain covered loans 
the fair value measurement reflects counterparty credit risk and other uncertainties 
the loss share receivable continues to be measured on the same basis as the related indemnified loans 
deterioration in the credit quality of the loans recorded as an adjustment to the allowance for covered loan losses would immediately increase the basis of the loss share receivable  with the offset recorded through the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income 
increases in the credit quality or cash flows of loans reflected as an adjustment to yield and accreted into income over the remaining life of the loans decrease the basis of the loss share receivable  with such decrease being accreted into income over the same period or the life of the loss share agreements  whichever is shorter 
loss assumptions used in the basis of the loss share receivable are consistent with the loss assumptions used to measure the related covered loans 
due to the accounting requirements of acquired loans  certain trends and credit statistics may be impacted if such loans are included 
the corporation believes that excluding the acquired loans from the presentation of such statistics is more meaningful and representative of its ongoing operations and credit quality 
allowance for loan losses as explained in note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans and allowance for loan losses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the allowance for loan losses represents management estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management estimates credit losses based on individual loans determined to be impaired and on all other loans grouped based on similar risk characteristics 
this estimate is based on the current economy impact on the timing and expected amounts of future cash flows on impaired loans as well as historical loss experience associated with homogeneous pools of loans 
management also considers internal and external factors such as economic conditions  loan management practices  portfolio monitoring  and other risks  collectively known as qualitative factors or q factors  to estimate credit losses in the loan portfolio 
management estimate of the allowance for the commercial portfolio could be affected by risk rating upgrades or downgrades as a result of fluctuations in the general economy  developments within a particular industry  or changes in an individual credit due to factors particular to that credit such as competition  management or business performance 
a reasonably possible scenario would be an estimated migration of lower risk related pass credits to criticized status which could increase the inherent losses by million 
for the consumer portfolio  where individual products are reviewed on a group basis or in loan pools  losses can be affected by such things as collateral value  loss severity  the economy  and other uncontrollable factors 
the consumer portfolio is largely comprised of loans that are secured by primary residences and home equity lines and loans 
a basis point increase in the estimated loss rates on the residential mortgage and home equity line and loan portfolios would increase the inherent losses by million 
the remaining consumer portfolio inherent loss analysis includes reasonably possible scenarios with estimated loss rates increasing by basis points  which would change the related inherent losses by million 
additionally the estimate of the allowance for loan losses for the entire portfolio may change due to modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding and general economic conditions as evidenced by changes in interest rates  unemployment rates  bankruptcy filings  used car prices and real estate values 
while no one factor is dominant  each has the ability to result in actual loan losses which differ from originally estimated amounts 

table of contents the information presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of the allowance to key assumptions 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome 
income taxes management evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other information and maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these relative risks 
changes to the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations being conducted by taxing authorities and changes to statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative risks of tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  can affect deferred taxes and accrued taxes as well as the current period income tax expense and can be material to the corporation operating results for any particular reporting period 
note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the corporation income taxes 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in various aspects of its business  the corporation uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposures to changes in interest rates and market prices for other financial instruments 
derivative instruments are required to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in the fair value recorded directly in earnings 
to qualify for and maintain hedge accounting  the corporation must meet formal documentation and effectiveness evaluation requirements both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires strict adherence to documentation and effectiveness testing requirements  judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings  and measurement of changes in the fair value of hedged items 
if in the future derivative financial instruments used by the corporation no longer qualify for hedge accounting  the impact on the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings could be significant 
when hedge accounting is discontinued  the corporation would continue to carry the derivative on the balance sheet at its fair value  however  for a cash flow derivative  changes in its fair value would be recorded in earnings instead of through other comprehensive income  and for a fair value derivative  the changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability would no longer be recorded through earnings 
see also note summary of significant accounting policies and note derivatives and hedging activity in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation methodologies fair value measurement applies whenever accounting guidance requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
fair value is an estimate of the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction ie  not a forced transaction  such as a liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date and is based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability 
fair value measurement and disclosure guidance establishes a three level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
the classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and whether the inputs used for measurement are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market derived or market based information obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect management estimates about market data 
level valuations are based on quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level valuations are 
table of contents based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market 
level valuations are generated from model based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques include the use of option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques 
fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where limited or no observable market data exists are based primarily upon estimates which cannot be determined with precision and in many cases may not reflect amounts exchanged in a current sale of the financial instrument 
fair value measurement and disclosure guidance differentiates between those assets and liabilities required to be carried at fair value at every reporting period recurring and those assets and liabilities that are only required to be adjusted to fair value under certain circumstances nonrecurring 
as of december   level financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis included single issuer trust preferred securities that represented less than of the corporation available for sale portfolio 
see note fair value measurement in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the corporation use of fair value and the related measurement techniques 
goodwill goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
the corporation is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the corporation has elected to test for goodwill impairment as of november th of each year 
the valuation and testing methodologies used in the corporation analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the first step in testing for goodwill impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the corporation reporting units for purposes of this testing are its major lines of business  commercial  retail and wealth 
the corporation engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in the computation of the fair value estimates of each reporting unit as part of its annual impairment assessment 
fair values are estimated using comparable external market data market approach and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information income approach 
a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is also performed 
management believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable 
however  if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used  the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future 
the valuation utilized market and income approach methodologies and applied a weighted average to each in order to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
fair values of reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis derived from internal earnings forecasts 
the primary assumptions management uses in the implied fair value calculation include discount rates  asset and liability growth rates  and other income and expense estimates 
the corporation utilized the best information currently available to estimate future performance for each reporting unit  however  future adjustments to these projections may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions utilized in making these assumptions 
the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value  suggesting goodwill impairment 
in such a case  the corporation would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit fair value and then compare that 
table of contents hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit net assets excluding goodwill 
any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on the corporation analysis performed in the fourth quarter  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
mortgage servicing rights when the corporation sells mortgage loans in the secondary market  it may retain the right to service the loans sold in exchange for a servicing fee that is collected over the life of the loan as the payments are received from the borrower 
such amounts are initially capitalized as mortgage servicing rights on the consolidated balance sheets at current fair value 
mortgage servicing rights are remeasured at each subsequent reporting date using the amortization method 
under the amortization method  mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
amortization is recorded in loan sales and servicing income 
at each reporting period  mortgage servicing rights are assessed for impairment based on fair value of those rights 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights typically rises as market interest rates increase and declines as market interest rates decrease  however  the extent to which this occurs depends in part on the magnitude of changes in market interest rates  and the differential between the then current market interest rates for mortgage loans and the mortgage interest rates included in the mortgage servicing portfolio 
since sales of mortgage servicing rights tend to occur in private transactions and the precise terms and conditions of the sales are typically not readily available  there is a limited market to refer to in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights 
as such  like other participants in the mortgage banking business  the corporation determines the fair value by estimating the present value of the asset future cash flows utilizing market based prepayment rates  discount rates  and other assumptions 
the corporation utilizes a third party vendor to perform the modeling to estimate the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights 
the corporation reviews the estimated fair values and assumptions used by the third party in the model on a quarterly basis 
the corporation also compares the estimates of fair value and assumptions to recent market activity and against its own experience 
additional information pertaining to the accounting for mortgage servicing rights is included in note mortgage servicing rights and mortgage servicing activity in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits the corporation sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain of its employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates  as determined by the corporation  within certain guidelines 
the corporation considers market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the corporation pension administrative committee committee has developed a statement of investment policies and objectives statement to assist firstmerit and the investment managers of the pension plan in effectively supervising and managing the assets of the pension plan 
the investment philosophy contained in the statement sets the investment time horizon as long term and the risk tolerance level as slightly above average while requiring diversification among several asset classes and securities 
without sacrificing 
table of contents returns  or increasing risk  the statement recommends a limited number of investment manager relationships and permits both separate accounts and commingled investments vehicles 
based on the demographics  actuarial funding situation  business and financial characteristics and risk preference  the statement defines that the pension fund as a total return investor return and accordingly current income is not a key goal of the plan 
the pension asset allocation policy has set guidelines based on the plan objectives  characteristics of the pension liabilities  industry practices  the current market environment  and practical investment issues 
the committee has decided to investment in traditional ie  publicly traded securities and not alternative asset classes eg  private equity  hedge funds  real estate at this time 
assumed discount rates reflect the time value of money as of the measurement date in determining the present value of future cash outflows for pension and postretirement benefit payments 
the objective of setting a discount rate is to establish an obligation for postretirement benefits equivalent to an amount that  if invested in high quality fixed income securities  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the pension and postretirement benefits when due 
assumed discount rates are reevaluated at each measurement date 
if the general level of interest rates rises or declines  the assumed discount rates will change in a similar manner 
the method used to estimate the discount rate can be changed if facts and circumstances indicate that a different method would result in a better estimate of the discount rate 
as of december   cash flows specific to each plan along with the aon top quartile yield curve aon yield curve were used by the corporation as the basis for estimating the discount rate 
the aon yield curve provides the best estimate of cash flows from investment in high quality fixed income securities to be used to pay the corporation pension and postretirement benefits when due 
the primary assumptions used in determining the corporation pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses are presented in note benefit plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the actuarial assumptions used by the corporation may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while the corporation believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect the corporation financial position or results of operations 
forward looking statements safe harbor statement information in the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section within this annual report on form k  which is not historical or factual in nature  and which relates to expectations for future shifts in loan portfolio to consumer and commercial loans  increase in core deposits base  allowance for loan losses  demands for the corporation services and products  future services and products to be offered  increased numbers of customers  and like items  constitute forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties
