overview we design  manufacture  market and sell furnishings and accessories  textiles  fine leathers  and felt  for the workplace and home 
our commitment to innovation and modern design has yielded a comprehensive portfolio of products and a brand recognized for high quality and a sophisticated image 
our products are targeted at the middle to upper end of the market and are sold primarily in north 
table of contents america and europe through a direct sales force and a broad network of independent dealers and retailers 
we operate under a management philosophy that incorporates a collaborative culture  client driven processes and a lean  agile operating structure 
our employees are performance driven and motivated by a variable incentive compensation system and broad based equity ownership in the company 
we believe the strength of our brand and our products  combined with this operating philosophy  leads to superior financial performance for our stakeholders 
in  according to our industry trade association  the business and institutional furniture manufacturer association  or bifma  industry sales and orders contracted and  respectively  when compared with we believe the uncertainty in the economy  especially the uncertainty surrounding the fiscal issues being debated in congress and by local governments across the country  has caused many clients and potential clients to be more cautious in their furniture spending 
we believe this is one of the primary reasons the industry saw sales and orders decrease year over year in during  our sales decreased when compared with the prior year 
this decline in sales for can be mainly attributed to decreased purchases from the federal government and financial services clients  as our sales to commercial clients actually grew in the poor economic conditions in europe also negatively impacted our studio segment sales  which impacted our overall sales 
during  we generated operating profit of million  or of net sales  compared to operating profit of million  or of net sales  during during  operating profit included a million curtailment benefit primarily related to the modification of postretirement medical benefits 
during  we generated net income of million  or diluted earnings per share  compared to million  or diluted earnings per share  in during  we completed the acquisition of richard schultz design  inc  a designer and manufacturer of outdoor furniture for the residential  hospitality  and contract office furniture markets 
the schultz designs were originally part of knoll collection but were subsequently spun off in the early s 
we believe these iconic outdoor designs will benefit from our broader sales and distribution capability while simultaneously strengthening our designer and consumer offering in the outdoor furniture category 
we continued to aggressively manage our balance sheet during during the first quarter of  we negotiated a new million revolving credit facility that runs through february  we believe this new facility will give us the flexibility we need to meet our business needs for at least the next few years 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and our current report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission on february  for further information regarding our new credit facility 
as of december   our outstanding debt was million 
since the end of  we have reduced our outstanding debt by million and we remain comfortably in compliance with all of our bank covenants 
during  we used free cash to pay dividends to our shareholders totaling million 
this represents an increase of million when compared with during the third quarter of  we increased our quarterly dividend from per share to per share 
we also spent million on capital expenditures in capital expenditures were slightly higher when compared with mainly due to our continued implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system 
we expect sales demand to be flat going into as we continue to face historically high vacancy rates  economic uncertainty and depressed business confidence 
however  commercial construction data  the architecture billings index  and improvement in the job markets  suggest the foundation is building for a stronger and we recently announced an aggressive program of strategic investments and initiatives commencing in to grow our revenues to over billion annually while generating 
table of contents operating profit margins above 
the program consists of four key pieces to maximize our office segment profitability  target under penetrated and emerging categories and markets for growth  expand our reach into consumer and decorator channels around the world  and invest in the knoll brand 
in total to fund these investments we expect operating expenses as a percent of sales to increase in the next few years by approximately to basis points annually 
capital expenditures also could increase by as much as million in and then stabilize in the million range for the next few years 
while we expect these initiatives to negatively impact profits in the short term  we believe this program is in the best interest of all our stakeholders long term and will position us well for expansion and growth during and segment reporting our three reporting segments consist of office  which includes our systems  seating  storage  tables  desks and knollextra ergonomic accessories as well as the international sales of our north american office products  studio  which includes knollstudio  knoll europe where over half our sales consist of knollstudio products and richard schultz design  and coverings  which includes knolltextiles  edelman leather  and spinneybeck leather including filfelt 
we sometimes refer to our studio and coverings segments collectively as our specialty businesses 
these businesses generally provide our most profitable sales and we will continue our efforts to grow these segments

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table highlights certain key cash flows and capital information pertinent to the discussion that follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures  net cash used in investing activities purchase of common stock for treasury proceeds from revolving credit facilities repayment of revolving credit facilities payment of dividends proceeds from issuance of common stock cash used in financing activities historically  we have carried significant amounts of debt  and cash generated by operating activities has been used to fund working capital  capital expenditures  repurchase shares  pay quarterly dividends and make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness 
our capital expenditures are typically for new product tooling and manufacturing equipment 
these capital expenditures support new products and continuous improvements in our manufacturing processes 
in addition  we began growth initiative programs in our studio and coverings segments which increased our capital spending during as well as our continued expenditures related to our technology infrastructure upgrades with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system 
at december   cash held outside of the united states was million 
in february  we announced a three year plan of strategic investments and initiatives intended to enable us to achieve our revenue and operating profit margin goals of over billion in revenues and over operating margins 
this plan will require increased expenditures  primarily in  and we expect these increases to negatively impact short term profits 
however  we believe these are the right investments to achieve our long term goals 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities consisted of million from net income  plus various non cash charges which included million of stock compensation expense and a million write off of deferred financing fees  and million of unfavorable changes in assets and liabilities 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities consisted of million from net income  plus various non cash charges which included a million curtailment benefit primarily related to the modification of the company post retirement medical benefits and million of unfavorable changes in assets and liabilities 
for the year ended december   we used available cash  including million cash from operating activities to repay million of debt  fund million in capital expenditures  fund dividend payments to shareholders totaling million  and to fund working capital 
during the third quarter of we increased our quarterly dividend from per share to per share 
for the year ended december   we used available cash  including the million of cash from operating activities to repay million of debt  fund million in capital expenditures  fund dividend payments to shareholders totaling million  and to fund working capital 
we use our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course of business to fund our working capital needs and  at times  make significant borrowings and repayments under the facility depending on our cash needs and availability at such time 
as of december   there was approximately million outstanding under the facility  compared to million outstanding under the facility as of 
table of contents december  borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time  but no later than february see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further information regarding this amended facility 
our revolving credit facility requires that we comply with two financial covenants our consolidated leverage ratio  defined as the ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement for a period of four fiscal quarters  cannot exceed to  and our consolidated interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of our consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement for a period of four fiscal quarters to our consolidated interest expense  must be a minimum of to we are also required to comply with various other affirmative and negative covenants  including without limitation  covenants that prevent or restrict our ability to pay dividends  engage in certain mergers or acquisitions  make certain investments or loans  incur future indebtedness  engage in sale leaseback transactions  alter our capital structure or line of business  prepay subordinated indebtedness  engage in certain transactions with affiliates and sell stock or assets 
we are currently in compliance with all of the covenants and conditions under our credit facility 
we believe that existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows  together with borrowings available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund normal working capital needs  capital spending requirements  debt service requirements and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months 
however  because of the financial covenants mentioned above  our capacity under our revolving credit facility could be reduced if our trailing consolidated ebitda as defined by our credit agreement would decline due to deteriorating market conditions 
future debt payments may be paid out of cash flows from operations  from future refinancing of our debt or from equity issuances 
however  our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness  to satisfy our other debt obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years total long term debt operating leases purchase commitments pension plan contributions a postretirement benefit plan obligations a total a due to the uncertainty of future cash outflows  contributions to the pension and other post retirement benefit plans subsequent to have been excluded from the table above 
b due to the uncertainty of future cash outflows  uncertain tax positions have been excluded from the table above 
contractual obligations for long term debt include principal and interest payments 
interest has been included at the variable rate in effect as of december   as applicable 

table of contents environmental matters our past and present business operations and the past and present ownership and operation of manufacturing plants on real property are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to discharges to air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances 
as a result  we are involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters and could become subject to fines or penalties related thereto 
we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future  how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist 
compliance with more stringent laws or regulations  or stricter interpretation of existing laws  may require additional expenditures by us  some of which may be material 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla for remediation costs associated with waste disposal sites that we previously used 
the remediation costs and our allocated share at some of these cercla sites are unknown 
we may also be subject to claims for personal injury or contribution relating to cercla sites 
we reserve amounts for such matters when expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that follow are those policies that require the most judgment  estimation and assumption in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients and dealers to make required payments 
the allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
we evaluate the past due status of our trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale 
if the financial condition of our clients and dealers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine that recovery is unlikely 
losses have been consistent with our expectations 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we reserve inventory that  in our judgment  is impaired or obsolete 
obsolescence 
table of contents may be caused by the discontinuance of a product line  changes in product material specifications  replacement products in the marketplace and other competitive influences 
goodwill and other intangible assets we record the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill 
goodwill and indefinite lived trademarks are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that a possible impairment may have been incurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach which discounts future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects our cost of capital  otherwise known as the discounted cash flow method dcf 
these estimated fair values are based on financial projections and certain cash flow measures 
the indefinite lived trademarks are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair value based on current revenue projections of the related operations  under the relief from royalty method 
any excess carrying value over the amount of fair value is recognized as an impairment 
any impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified 
finite lived assets such as customer relationships  non compete agreements  and licenses are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we review the carrying values of these assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets 
deferred financing fees deferred financing costs that are incurred by the company in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the underlying indebtedness 
business combinations the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values  with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in our operating results from the dates of acquisition 
product warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and by material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
cost estimates are based on historical product failure rates and identified one time fixes for each specific product category 
warranty cost generally varies in direct relation to sales volume  as such costs tend to be a consistent percentage of revenue 
should actual costs differ from original estimates  the estimated warranty liability would be revised 
employee benefits we are partially self insured for our employee health benefits 
we accrue for employee health benefit obligations based on an actuarial valuation 
the actuarial valuation is based upon historical claims as well as a number of assumptions  including rates of inflation for medical costs  and benefit plan changes 
actual results could be materially different from the estimates used 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor two defined benefit pension plans and two other postretirement benefit plans 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates  as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
both the pension plans and the other postretirement benefit plans were modified during the year ended december  participants who had or greater points age plus years of service could elect to stay in the pension and accrue additional benefits or receive the company k match which was reinstated as of january  those with less than points were removed from the pension plan and will not accrue any additional benefits 
the company other postretirement benefit plans are in the process of being phased out 
as a result of this modification  the company recorded a million curtailment benefit during the year ended december  we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on aggregating the expected rates of return for each component of the plan asset mix 
we use historic plan asset returns combined with current market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption and generally does not change annually 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments as of our annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
likewise  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million or million  respectively 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recognized over the expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors  including experience and assumption changes with respect to the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized gains and losses are systematically recognized as a change in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance relating to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
key assumptions we use in determining the amount of the obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb  under the appropriate accounting guidance  include the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from our actuaries 
we assume that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting assumed increases in efficiency and cost containment initiatives in the health care system 
at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was and in determining the benefit obligation for and in determining the net periodic benefit cost in for medical and prescription drug  respectively 
the rate was then assumed to decrease to an ultimate rate of for for the medical plan and for the prescription drug plan and thereafter for the benefit obligation 
increasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percentage point in each year would increase the benefit obligation as of december  by million and increase the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for by a minimal amount 
decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would decrease the benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and decrease the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for by a minimal amount 

table of contents in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance  we recognize in our consolidated balance sheet the funded status ie the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
to record the unfunded status of our plans we recorded an additional liability and an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the actuarial assumptions we use in determining our pension and opeb retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
commitments and contingencies we establish reserves for the estimated cost of environmental and legal contingencies when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters 
we engage outside experts as deemed necessary or appropriate to assist in the evaluation of exposure 
from time to time  as information becomes available regarding changes in circumstances for ongoing issues as well as information regarding emerging issues  our potential liability is reassessed and reserve balances are adjusted as necessary 
revisions to our estimates of potential liability  and actual expenditures related to environmental and legal contingencies  could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance relating to income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
the appropriate accounting guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
at december   our deferred tax liabilities of million exceeded deferred tax assets of million by million 
at december   deferred tax liabilities of million exceeded deferred tax assets of million by million 
our deferred tax assets at december  and of million and million  respectively  are net of valuation allowances of million and million  respectively 
we have recorded the valuation allowance primarily for net operating loss carryforwards in foreign tax jurisdictions where we have incurred historical tax losses from operations or acquired tax losses through acquisition  and have determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate on an ongoing basis the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and our assessment of available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance relating to uncertainty in income taxes 
accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

table of contents derivative financial instruments we occasionally utilize derivative instruments to mitigate volatility related to interest rates and foreign currency exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of those instruments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income if they qualify for hedge accounting or in earnings if they do not qualify for hedge accounting 
derivatives qualify for hedge accounting if they are designated as hedge instruments and if the hedge is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the asset or liability hedged 
accordingly  gains and losses from changes in derivative fair value of effective hedges are deferred and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation according to applicable accounting guidance  which requires the company to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
this expense is recognized over the applicable vesting period 
stock options the fair value for stock options is estimated at the date of grant using an option pricing model  which requires management to make certain assumptions 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury spot rate with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the company stock price 
the model takes into consideration the historical dividends paid on common stock 
the weighted average expected life is based on the contractual term of the stock option and expected employee exercise dates  which is based on the historical exercise behavior of the company employees 
forfeitures are estimated at the date of grant based on historical experience 
restricted stock and restricted stock units the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units are based on the closing market price of the company common stock on the date of grant 
the company recognizes compensation expense relating to restricted stock and restricted stock units ratably over the vesting period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the normal course of business  we are routinely subjected to market risk associated with interest rate movements and foreign currency exchange rate movements 
interest rate risk arises from our debt obligations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk arises from our non us operations and purchases of inventory from foreign suppliers 
we also have risk in our exposure to certain materials and transportation costs 
steel  leather  wood products and plastics are all used in our products 
for the year ended december   we estimated that materials inflation was approximately million and transportation inflation was minimal 
during  we estimated materials inflation was approximately million and transportation inflation was approximately million 
we continue to work to offset price increases in raw materials and transportation through our global sourcing initiatives  cost improvements and price increases to our products 
interest rate risk we have variable rate debt obligations that are denominated in us dollars 
a change in interest rates impacts the interest incurred and cash paid on the variable rate debt 
in the past we have used interest rate swap agreements for other than trading purposes in order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
in may of  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements in order to manage our interest rate risk 
each agreement hedged a notional amount of million 
two of the agreements were effective from june  through june  and the other two were effective june  and expired june  fluctuations in libor affect both our net financial instrument position and the amount of cash to be paid or received by us  if any  under these agreements 
there were no interest rate hedge agreements outstanding as of december  or december  see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further information regarding the interest rate swap agreements

taking into account payments on the above noted interest rate swap agreements  the weighted average rate for the same period of was 
the following table summarizes our market risks associated with our debt obligations as of december  for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity 
variable interest rates presented for variable rate debt represent the weighted average interest rates on our credit facility borrowings as of december  thereafter total fair value in thousands rate sensitive liabilities long term debt variable rate variable interest rate an increase in our effective interest rate of would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
we will continue to review our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and evaluate whether we should manage such exposures through derivative transactions 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we manufacture our products in the united states  canada and italy  and sell our products primarily in those markets as well as in other european countries 
our foreign sales and certain expenses are transacted in foreign currencies 
our production costs  profit margins and competitive

the principal foreign currencies in which we conduct business are the canadian dollar and the euro 
approximately and of our revenues in and  respectively  and and of our cost of goods sold in and  respectively  were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a million translation loss in and a million translation gain in from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts for other than trading purposes in order to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rates associated with short term operating receivables of a canadian subsidiary that are payable by our us operations 
the terms of these contracts are generally less than a year 
changes in the fair value of such contracts are reported in earnings in the period the value of the contract changes 
the net gain or loss upon settlement and the change in fair value of outstanding contracts is recorded as a component of other income expense
