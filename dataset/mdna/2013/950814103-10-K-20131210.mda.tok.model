executive overview we are one of the world largest distributors and providers of comprehensive supply chain management services to the global aerospace industry on an annual sales basis 
our services range from traditional distribution to the management of supplier relationships  quality assurance  kitting  jit delivery and point of use inventory management 
we supply approximately  different skus  including hardware  bearings  tools and more recently  electronic components and machined parts 
we serve our customers under three types of arrangements jit contracts  which govern comprehensive outsourced supply chain management services  ltas  which set prices for specific parts  and ad hoc sales 
jit contracts and ltas  which together comprised approximately of our fiscal net sales  are multi year arrangements that provide us with significant visibility into our future sales 
founded in by the father of our current chief executive officer  wesco has grown to serve over  customers in the commercial  military and general aviation sectors  including the leading oems and their subcontractors  through which we support nearly all major western aircraft programs 
we have grown our net sales at a compounded annual growth rate over the past years to million in fiscal we have more than  employees and operate across locations in countries 
on september   of the outstanding stock of wesco aircraft hardware  wesco aircraft israel and the european entities of flintbrook ltd  wesco aircraft france and wesco aircraft germany were acquired by wesco aircraft holdings  inc the acquisition was completed in a leveraged transaction in which affiliates of carlyle  the prior owner and certain employees of wesco contributed the equity portion of the purchase price 
the prior owner and certain employees investment represented a contribution of ownership in the predecessor company to the newly formed holding company 
in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  business combinations  the acquired assets and liabilities have been recorded at fair value for the interests acquired by new investors and at carryover basis for the continuing investors 
on june   wesco aircraft hardware acquired of the outstanding stock of airtechnics  inc  or airtechnics  a distributor of electronic components for the aerospace industry  which we refer to as the airtechnics acquisition 
the acquisition was funded through a provision in the old credit facilities that provided for additional borrowing under existing credit terms 
operating cash was also used by us to pay a portion of the purchase price and cover transaction fees and expenses 
the assets and liabilities have been recorded at fair value for the interests we acquired 
on july   wesco aircraft  together with wesco aircraft europe  acquired substantially all of the assets of interfast for million  which we refer to as the interfast acquisition 
the interfast acquisition was funded with a combination of cash and borrowings under the company million 
table of contents revolving facility 
interfast is a toronto based value added distributor of specialty fasteners  fastening systems and production installation tooling for the aerospace  electronics and general industrial markets 
the acquisition of interfast provides us stronger relationships with strategic customers  a greater presence with commercial mro maintenance  repair and overhaul providers and an entry into the high end industrial fastener market 
industry trends affecting our business commercial aerospace market we rely on demand for new commercial aircraft for a significant portion of our sales 
commercial aircraft demand is driven by many factors  including airline passenger volumes  airline profitability  the introduction of new aircraft models  general economic conditions and the aging life cycle of current fleets 
during fiscal  and  our customers were impacted by the global recession and weak demand for air passenger travel  which resulted in significant losses for the global airline industry 
during fiscal and  as the global economy began to recover  airline passenger volumes began to increase 
increased passenger traffic volumes and the return to profitability of the global airline industry have renewed demand for commercial aircraft  particularly for more fuel efficient models  such as the boeing and airbus a although demand for commercial aircraft has increased in fiscal   and  these increases have not yet fully translated to increased purchasing patterns by our customers 
in addition  commercial mro providers are expected to benefit from similar growth trends to those impacting the commercial oem market  in particular  increased revenue passenger miles  which will in turn drive growth in the commercial fleet and greater utilization of existing aircraft 
growth in the commercial aerospace market is also expected to be aided by a recovery in business jet and regional jet deliveries 
military aerospace market a significant portion of our sales are also reliant on demand for new military aircraft  which is primarily driven by government spending  the timing of military aircraft orders and evolving us department of defense strategies and policies 
we believe the diversity of the military aircraft programs we service can help us mitigate the impact of program delays  changes or cancellations  through increased sales to other active programs that directly benefit from such delays  changes or cancellations 
for example  we believe the delay in production of the jsf has resulted in an increase in our sales to manufacturers of the f going forward  we believe that we will benefit from increases in the production of the jsf  a program on which we believe our business is well positioned 
we also believe that the compelling value proposition that our business model presents to our customers will be even more appealing in an environment of reduced military budgets in the united states 
we also support customers in the military aerospace mro market and believe that our presence in this market helps us mitigate the volatility of new military aircraft sales with sales to the aftermarket 
we expect demand in the military mro market to be driven by requirements to maintain aging military fleets  changes in the overall fleet size and the level of us military activity overseas 
other factors affecting our financial results fluctuations in revenue there are many factors  such as fluctuations in ad hoc sales  timing of aircraft deliveries  changes in selling prices  the amount of new customers consigned inventory and the volume or timing of customer orders that can cause fluctuations in our financial results from quarter to quarter 
to normalize for short term fluctuations  we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or 
table of contents years of activity rather than discrete short term periods 
as such  it can be difficult to determine longer term trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons 
we will continue our strategy of seeking to expand our relationships with existing customers by transitioning them to our comprehensive jit supply chain management services as well as expanding relationships with our existing jit customers to include additional customer sites and additional skus 
we believe this strategy serves to mitigate fluctuations in our net sales 
however  our sales to jit customers may fail to meet our expectations for a variety of reasons  in particular if industry build rates are lower than expected or  for newer jit customers  if their consigned inventory  which must be exhausted before corresponding products are purchased directly from us  is larger than we expected 
although our ad hoc sales as a percentage of net sales decreased from in fiscal to during fiscal and increased to during fiscal  we do not believe that this recent upward trend in ad hoc sales is inconsistent with our strategy of transitioning customers to jit contracts and ltas 
instead  we believe that an increase in ad hoc sales is typical during industry growth cycles  as both customer demand and supplier lead times increase  resulting in customers facing parts shortages that they attempt to mitigate by making ad hoc purchases 
accordingly  even though we believe that our ad hoc sales will continue at the current level into fiscal  we do not believe that this trend will impact our long term jit and lta strategy 
during  we were notified by boeing of its intent to perform certain supply chain management functions in house that we had been providing at two boeing facilities under jit contracts that were awarded to us when these particular facilities were under different ownership 
in fiscal  jit sales under these contracts accounted for approximately of our net sales and our total sales to these two boeing facilities accounted for approximately of our total sales during the same period 
if any of our customers are acquired by a company that elects not to utilize our services  or attempt to implement in sourcing initiatives  it could have a negative effect on our strategy to mitigate fluctuations in our net sales 
additionally  although we derive a significant portion of our net sales from the building of new commercial and military aircraft  we have not typically experienced extreme fluctuations in our net sales when sales for an individual aircraft program decrease  which we believe is attributable to our diverse base of customers and programs 
in addition  we believe our substantial sales under jit contracts and ltas help to mitigate fluctuations in our financial results  as jit and lta customers tend to have steadier purchasing patterns than ad hoc customers 
however  our sales to jit and lta customers may fail to meet our expectations for a variety of reasons  in particular if industry build rates are lower than expected or  for newer jit customers  if their consigned inventory  which must be exhausted before corresponding products are purchased directly from us  is larger than we expected or if estimated part by part usage rates are actually lower 
fluctuations in margins we entered the electronic components business in after the airtechnics acquisition 
as we continue to grow our electronics products group  or epg  business  we expect that epg sales as a percentage of our total net sales will increase 
gross profit margins on epg products are lower than the gross profit margins on many of our other products  which we believe will result in a reduction in our overall gross profit margins as our epg sales increase 
we believe that our strategy of growing our jit and lta sales and converting ad hoc customers into jit and lta customers will negatively affect our gross profit margins  as gross profit margins tend to be higher on ad hoc sales than they are in jit and lta related sales 
however  we believe any potential adverse impact on our gross profit margins is outweighed by the benefits of a more stable long term revenue stream attributable to jit contracts and ltas 
during fiscal  we saw increased competition in the ad hoc market  which has slightly reduced our typically higher ad hoc margins  and we expect the current margins to remain relatively consistent during fiscal however  we believe 
table of contents that as industry build rates and manufacturer lead times increase  margins on ad hoc sales will begin to increase 
our jit contracts and ltas generally provide for fixed prices  which can expose us to risks if prices we pay to our suppliers rise due to increased raw material or other costs 
however  we believe our expansive product offerings and inventories  our ad hoc sales and  where possible  our longer term agreements with suppliers have enabled us to mitigate this risk 
fluctuations in cash flow we believe our cash flows may be affected by fluctuations in our inventory that can occur over time 
when we are awarded new programs  we generally increase our inventory to account for expected sales related to the new program  which often take time to materialize 
as a result  if certain programs for which we have procured inventory are delayed or if newer jit customers consigned inventory is larger than we expected  we may experience a more sustained inventory increase 
for example  we increased our inventory in anticipation of deliveries of the boeing  which have been significantly delayed 
inventory fluctuations may also be attributable to general industry trends 
for example  as production in the global aerospace industry increases  we typically see an increase in demand from our customers and a delay in deliveries from our suppliers  which tends to result in a temporary inventory reduction and increased cash flow 
however  when production in the aerospace industry decreases  our suppliers are able to catch up on our outstanding orders  while demand from our customers decreases  which tends to result in an increase in inventory levels and decreased cash flow 
for example  in  as a result of the global economic recession  production in the aerospace industry decreased  freeing up our suppliers to ship previously ordered products to us faster than expected 
as a result  we experienced an inventory build of approximately million during fiscal although we have made  and continue to make  adjustments to our purchasing practices in order to mitigate the effect of inventory fluctuations on our cash flows  inventory fluctuations continue to occur and  as a result  will continue to impact our cash flows 
during fiscal  we experienced an inventory build of approximately million  which was primarily driven by purchases to support new contracts as well as strategic investments made in anticipation of the expected industry growth cycle 
we would expect inventory to continue to grow as net sales increase 
also  given that growth in our business typically requires us to procure additional inventory  which has a negative impact on our cash flows  we believe that cost of sales as a percentage of inventory is a useful additional metric to use when analyzing our inventory management relative to the growth of our business 
for example  our cost of sales as a percentage of inventory increased from during fiscal to during fiscal exclusive of any sales or inventory attributable to the interfast business and slightly decreased from during fiscal exclusive of any sales or inventory attributable to the interfast business to during fiscal first year inclusive of any sales or inventory attributable to the interfast business 
although we believe that our cost of sales as a percentage of inventory reflects a positive trend in inventory management  as disclosed above  our recent inventory build also related to strategic purchases made in anticipation of an expected industry growth cycle 
although we believe that during fiscal and the year ended september   the aerospace industry was in the early stages of a growth cycle  and accordingly made strategic inventory purchases  the typical increases in customer demand and supplier lead times that occur during growth cycles have not occurred within the expected time frame 
we believe that this lower than expected demand is the result of inventory purchases that remain in the supply chain from the last downturn and is taking longer for those parties to sell off 
accordingly  we believe that the strategic inventory purchases we made during fiscal and the year ended september   combined with this lower than expected demand  has had a modest negative impact on our cash flows  slightly offsetting 
table of contents the overall positive trend in inventory management  as reflected in the comparison of cost of sales as a percentage of inventory 
segment presentation we conduct our business through two reportable segments north america and rest of world 
we evaluate segment performance based on segment operating earnings or losses 
each segment reports its results of operations and makes requests for capital expenditures and acquisition funding to our chief operating decision maker  or codm 
our chief executive officer serves as our codm 
each operating segment has separate management teams and infrastructures dedicated to providing a full range of products and services to their respective customers 
key components of our results of operations the following is a discussion of the key line items included in our financial statements for the periods presented below under the heading results of operations 
these are the measures that management utilizes to assess our results of operations  anticipate future trends and evaluate risks in our business 
net sales our net sales include sales of c class aerospace parts  including hardware  bearings  electronic components  machined parts and installation tooling  and eliminate all intercompany sales 
we also provide certain services to our customers  including quality assurance  kitting and jit supply chain management 
however  these services are generally performed in connection with the sale of our products  and as such  the price of such services is included in the price of the products delivered to customers 
we do not account for these services as a separate element  as the services do not generally have stand alone value and typically cannot be separated from the product element of the arrangement 
there are no significant post delivery obligations associated with these services 
we sell products and services to our customers using three types of contractual arrangements jit supply chain management contracts  ltas and individual ad hoc sales 
under jit contracts  customers commit to purchase specified parts from us at a fixed price  on an if and when needed basis  and we are responsible for maintaining high levels of stock availability of those parts 
ltas are essentially negotiated price lists for customers or individual customer sites that cover a range of pre determined parts  purchased on an as needed basis 
ad hoc customers purchase parts from us on an as needed basis and are generally supplied out of our existing inventory 
in addition  jit and lta customers often purchase parts that are not captured under their contract on an ad hoc basis 
in fiscal and  we experienced a decrease in ad hoc sales due to a weakening aerospace market that resulted in customers reducing their on hand inventory and our strategy of transitioning ad hoc sales to jit contracts or ltas in an effort to achieve a more predictable revenue stream 
jit contracts and ltas typically run for three to five years 
however  in fiscal  and we experienced an increase in both ad hoc and lta sales 
cost of sales the principal component of our cost of sales is product cost  which was approximately of our total cost of sales for fiscal the remaining components are freight and expediting fees  import duties  tooling repair charges  packaging supplies and physical inventory adjustment charges  which collectively were approximately of our total cost of sales for fiscal product cost is determined by the current weighted average cost of each inventory item and inventory excess and obsolescence write down 
the current weighted average cost is a function of many factors  including fluctuations in the price of raw materials  the effect of inflation  the terms of 
table of contents long term agreements we negotiate with certain of our suppliers  the timing of bulk purchases that allow us to take advantage of price breaks from suppliers and general market trends that can result in increases or decreases in our suppliers available production capacity 
although we cannot specifically quantify trends relating to the costs of our products in inventory  during fiscal and  as a result of the economic downturn and its effect on the global aerospace industry  our suppliers collective production capacity increased  which generally resulted in a decrease in per part prices and therefore a decrease in our product costs 
we expect as conditions within the aerospace industry improve per part prices will increase as our suppliers capacity becomes more limited 
however  we believe the long term agreements we have with certain of our suppliers and our ability to make opportunistic  large scale product purchases will allow us to mitigate the impact of future per part price increases 
in addition  we believe we will be able to further mitigate the impact of any such future price increases on our results of operations by passing along the price increases to customers who are not a party to contracts with pre negotiated price lists 
inventory write down is calculated to estimate the amount of excess and obsolete inventory we currently have on hand 
we review inventory for excess and obsolescence write down quarterly and adjust the expense and future forecasted sell through rates as necessary 
for a description of our excess and obsolescence reserve policy  see critical accounting policies and estimates inventories 
as of september   and  we had recorded an aggregate of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to our excess and obsolescence reserve 
of these amounts  approximately million  million and million was recorded during fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe that these amounts are consistent with our historical experience and appropriately reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory inherent in our business 
for a more detailed description of the excess and obsolescence reserves we recorded during the periods covered by this report  including disclosure relating to our inventory that was comprised of units for which there have been no sales in the prior months  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
selling  general and administrative expenses the principal components of our selling  general and administrative expenses are salaries  wages  benefits and bonuses paid to our employees  stock based compensation  commissions paid to outside sales representatives  travel and other business expenses  training and recruitment costs  marketing  advertising and promotional event costs  rent  bad debt expense  professional services fees including legal  audit and tax  and ordinary day to day business expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense is also included in selling  general and administrative expenses  and consists primarily of scheduled depreciation for leasehold improvements  machinery and equipment  vehicles  computers  software and furniture and fixtures 
depreciation and amortization also includes intangible amortization expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  have continued to decline as we have leveraged the fixed cost and labor component of our infrastructure while consolidated net sales have grown 
however  for the year ended september   we experienced an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in part as a result of one time costs associated with our initial public offering and for the year ended september   we experienced an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in part as a result of the recent interfast acquisition and initial non recurring public company costs 
we continue to expect that selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percent of net sales  will decline over time as we continue to leverage our current infrastructure 

table of contents other expenses interest expense  net 
interest expense  net consists of the interest we pay on our long term debt  fees on our revolver and our line of credit  deferred financing costs and the costs of hedging agreements  net of interest income 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net is primarily comprised of unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss associated with transactions denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency of the reporting subsidiary 
critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate  and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they significantly affect our financial statements  and they require our most significant estimates and complex judgments 
inventories our inventory is comprised solely of finished goods 
inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market and in bound freight related costs are included as part of the cost of inventory held for resale 
we record provisions  as appropriate  to write down excess and obsolete inventory to estimated net realizable value 
the process for evaluating excess and obsolete inventory often requires us to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventories will be able to be sold in the normal course of business  which is described in greater detail below under excess and obsolescence reserve policy 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the write down required for excess and obsolete inventories 
in the future  if our inventories are determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventories are determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time such products are sold 
excess and obsolescence reserve policy we perform a monthly inventory analysis and record excess and obsolescence expense after weighing a number of factors  including historical sell through rates  current selling and buying patterns  forecasted future sales  program delays or cancellations  inventory quantities and aging  rights we have with certain manufacturers to exchange unsold products for new products and open customer orders 
the excess and obsolescence reserve includes both excess and slow moving inventory which typically includes inventory held by us after strategic purchases are made to take advantage of favorable pricing terms  speculative purchases based on current market trends or purchases timed to take supplier lead times into account  which may result in us maintaining excess and slow moving quantities of inventories 

table of contents the following contains a summary of the factors we consider when conducting our monthly reserve analysis for both excess and slow moving inventory in conducting our monthly reserve analysis with respect to slow moving inventory  we consider a variety of factors  including historical sell through rates  current selling and buying patterns  inventory quantities and aging  rights we have with certain manufacturers to exchange unsold products for new products and open customer orders 
furthermore  although our customers are not required to purchase a specific quantity of inventory from us  we are able to forecast future sales with a fair degree of precision by monitoring and tracking our customers production cycles  which forecasting is taken into account when conducting our reserve analysis 
we further note that we are required to make commitments to purchase inventory based on manufacturer lead times  which  historically could be up to two years 
in addition  we may be entitled to obtain price breaks or discounts based on the quantity of inventory we commit to purchase 
given the length of our manufacturers lead times  our desire to obtain advantageous inventory pricing  the impact of macro and micro economic conditions and variability within specific customer programs  our inventory reserve may increase at a rate higher than we originally anticipated  which can impact the amount of slow moving inventory we hold 
based on our historical experience  we have limited exposure related to our non excess and non slow moving inventory  as a majority of the products we sell can be sold across multiple aircraft platforms and the lifespan of the products we sell along with the design of the aircrafts that utilize these products is typically not subject to a high degree of obsolescence 
however  we do take program delays and cancelations into account when conducting our reserve analysis 
in addition  we weigh positive and negative factors that are substantially similar to the factors we consider when conducting our monthly reserve analysis 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
in accordance with the provisions of asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets acquired in a business combination are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
such events or circumstances may be a significant change in business climate  economic and industry trends  legal factors  negative operating performance indicators  significant competition  changes in strategy  or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level on july of each year 
step allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
such qualitative factors may include the following macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  and other relevant entity specific events 
if the entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not  the entity is then required to perform the existing two step quantitative impairment test which is used to identify potential goodwill impairments and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment losses to be recognized  if any  otherwise no further analysis is required 
an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and  instead  proceed directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
the first step identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
for all periods presented  our reporting units are consistent with our operating segments 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis and market earnings multiples 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires 
table of contents us to make various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
these assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the forecast and long term business plans of each operating segment 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units 
if the fair value exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step of the test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value  the second step measures the impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we test the indefinite lived intangible asset  consisting of a trademark  for impairment in the fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that their carrying values exceed their fair values 
fair value is estimated as the discounted value of future revenues using a royalty rate that a third party would pay for use of the asset 
variation in the royalty rates could impact the estimate of fair value 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we reviewed the carrying value of our reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets by comparing such amount to its fair value and determined that the carrying amount did not exceed its respective fair value 
during the years ended september   and  the fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of the reporting units carrying values 
additionally  the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
accordingly  management believes there are no impairments as of september  related to either goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible asset 
revenue recognition we recognize product and service revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii title transfers to the customer  iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on the terms of the sales contract 
in connection with the sale of our products  we often provide certain supply chain services 
these services are provided exclusively in connection with the sale of products  and as such  the price of such services is generally included in the price of the products delivered to the customer 
we do not account for these services as a separate element  as the services do not have stand alone value and cannot be separated from the product element of the arrangement 
there are no significant post delivery obligations associated with these services 
we also enter into sales rebates and profit sharing arrangements 
such customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales and recorded based upon estimates at the time products are sold 
these estimates are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products 
we review such rebates and profit sharing arrangements on an ongoing basis and accruals are adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 

table of contents management provides allowances for credits and returns  based on historic experience and adjusts such allowances as considered necessary 
to date  such provisions have been within the range of management expectations and the allowance established 
sales tax collected from customers is excluded from net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
asc  which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the company foreign subsidiaries are taxed in local jurisdictions at local statutory rates 
stock based compensation we account for all stock based compensation awards to employees and members of our board of directors based upon their fair values as of the date of grant using a fair value method and recognize the fair value of each award as an expense over the requisite service period using the graded vesting method 
for purposes of calculating stock based compensation  we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes merton valuation model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions including expected term  volatility  expected dividend  risk free interest rate  and the fair value of our common stock 
these assumptions generally require significant judgment 
we estimate the expected term of employee options using the average of the time to vesting and the contractual term 
we derive our expected volatility from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within our industry because we have little information on the volatility of the price of our common stock since we have limited trading history 
when making the selections of our industry peer companies to be used in the volatility calculation  we also consider the size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies 
these historical volatilities are weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor 
our expected dividend rate is zero  as we have never paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate any dividends in the foreseeable future 
we base the risk free interest rate on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon us treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to each grant expected term 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the following table 
table of contents summarizes the amount of non cash stock based compensation expense recognized in our statements of operations year ended september  dollars in thousands non cash stock based compensation for the years ending september  and  we expect to incur stock based compensation expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation expense and the actual factors that become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs for future grants 
these changes  if any  may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made 
we expect to continue to grant stock options in the future  and to the extent that we do  our actual stock based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase

ad hoc  jit  and lta net sales increased by million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in ad hoc net sales is primarily due to general growth across numerous customers and the interfast acquisition 
the increase in jit net sales was primarily due to the maturity of our existing contracts  as well as the additions of new locations for some of our major customers and general growth across the customer base partially offset by a non recurring contract sale with a customer that took place during the three months ended december  the increase in lta net sales was also attributable to general growth across numerous customers as no new material lta contracts were added during the period

the increase in the inventory balance was partially offset by the change in accounts payable of million 
another driver of the decrease was a million increase in the change in accounts receivable for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in the accounts receivable balance was driven by higher sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal and an increase in the days sales outstanding from days to days for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in days sales outstanding is due to the timing of sales at year end and a increase in our rest of world sales which typically have longer terms for the year ended september  as compared to september  our accounts receivable balance as a percentage of net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations are primarily driven by changes  from quarter to quarter  in i the timing of sales and ii the current average days sales outstanding 
the completion of customer contracts with accelerated payment terms can also contribute to these quarter to quarter fluctuations 
our allowance for doubtful accounts may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations are primarily driven by changes in our accounts receivable balance  and can also be impacted by the repayment of amounts owed to us that had previously been categorized as bad debt

during fiscal year  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of interfast for cdn million  which translated to million us dollars 
the remaining million increase in fiscal and the amounts for the years ended september  and september  were used for investments in various capital expenditures and to purchase property and equipment 
our purchases of property and equipment may vary from period to period due to the timing of the expansion of our business and the investment requirements to provide us with technology that allows us to better serve our customers

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  changes in interest rates and fluctuations in fuel prices 
foreign currency exposure currency translation during the years ended september  and september   approximately and  respectively  of our net sales were made by our foreign subsidiaries  and our total non us net sales represented approximately and  respectively  of our total net sales 
as a result of these international operating activities  we are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates  principally exchange rates between the us dollar  british pound  canadian dollar and the euro 
the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate for each relevant period 
this translation has no impact on our cash flow 
however  as foreign exchange rates change  there are changes to the us dollar equivalent of sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
any adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income on our statements of changes in stockholders equity 
we do not consider the risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations to be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
a hypothetical increase in the value of the british pound  the euro and the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in our net income of approximately million  less than million and million  respectively  during fiscal  and million  less than million and million  respectively  during fiscal a corresponding decrease would have resulted in a decrease in our net income of approximately million  less than million and million  respectively  during fiscal and million  less than million and million  respectively  during fiscal currency transactions currency transaction exposure arises where actual sales and purchases are made by a company in a currency other than its own functional currency 
during the year ended september   our subsidiary in the united kingdom had sales in us dollars and euros of approximately million and million  respectively  and had purchases in us dollars and euros of approximately million and million  respectively 
during the year ended september   our subsidiary in canada which we acquired in connection with the interfast acquisition  had sales in us dollars of approximately million and had purchases in us dollars of approximately million 
during the year ended september   our subsidiary in the united kingdom had sales in us dollars and euros of approximately million and million  respectively  and had purchases in us dollars and euros of approximately million and million  respectively 
during the year ended september   our subsidiary in canada  which we acquired in connection with the interfast acquisition  had sales in us dollars of approximately million and had purchases in us dollars of approximately million 
to the extent possible  we structure arrangements where the purchase transactions are denominated in us dollars in order to minimize near term exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
from september  to september   the pound strengthened slightly against the dollar by from to 
from september  to september   the u 
s dollar strengthened slightly against the pound by from to 
from september  to september   the u 
s dollar strengthened slightly against the pound by from to 
a weakening of the us dollar means we realize a greater amount of us dollar revenue on 
table of contents sales that were denominated in british pounds 
as a result of the slight movement of the us dollar during fiscal  and  currency transactions did not have a material impact on our financial results during those periods 
a hypothetical increase in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar would have resulted in an increase in our net income of approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively  attributable to our foreign currency transactions 
a corresponding decrease would have resulted in a decrease in our net income of approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
we have historically entered into currency forward and option contracts to limit exposure to currency rate changes and will continue to monitor our transaction exposure to currency rate changes 
gains and losses on these contracts are deferred until the transaction being hedged is finalized 
as of september   we had no outstanding currency forward and option contracts 
we do not hold or enter into currency forward and option contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our principal interest rate exposure relates to the senior secured credit facilities  which bear interest at a variable rate 
see part ii  item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources credit facilities senior secured credit facilities 
if there is a rise in interest rates  our debt service obligations on the borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  which would affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
at our debt level and borrowing rates as of september   annual cash interest expense  including fees under our revolving facility  would have been approximately million 
if variable interest rates were to change by  our interest expense would fluctuate approximately million per year  without taking into account the effect of any hedging instruments or the minimum libor requirement 
at our debt level and borrowing rates as of september   annual cash interest expense  including fees under our revolving facility  would have been approximately million 
if variable interest rates would have changed by during fiscal  our interest expense would have fluctuated approximately million per year  without taking into account the effect of any hedging instruments or the minimum libor requirement 
we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk on our borrowing activities 
upon the maturity of our previous interest rate swap agreements  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements one that expired in february and one that expired in june which we refer to collectively as the swaps 
each swap converted the interest rate on approximately million notional amount of our outstanding indebtedness from variable rates to a fixed interest rate 
during fiscal and  we recorded a gain in the amount of approximately million and million  respectively  as a result of changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments 
these gains are recorded as a component of interest expense 
the company is not currently a party to any swap agreements 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
fuel price risk our principal direct exposure to increases in fuel prices is as a result of potential increased freight costs caused by fuel surcharges or other fuel cost driven price increases implemented by the third party package delivery companies on which we rely 
we estimate that our annual freight costs are approximately million  and million during fiscal and  respectively  and  as a result  we do not believe the impact of these potential fuel surcharges or fuel cost driven price increases would have a material impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  increases in fuel prices may have an indirect material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as such increases may contribute to decreased airline profitability and  as a result  decreased demand for new commercial aircraft that utilize the products we sell 
see part i  item a 
risk factors we may be materially adversely affected by high fuel prices 
we do not use derivatives to manage our exposure to fuel prices
