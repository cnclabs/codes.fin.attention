additional information on our revenues and operations can found above in business general overview and operating strategy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our reporting segments and certain concentrated revenue streams 
results of operations our core business is promoting  marketing and sponsoring motorsports events and activities 
we derive a substantial portion of our total revenues from admissions  event related and nascar broadcasting revenue 
our revenues and expenses are classified in the following categories because they are important to  and used by  management in assessing operations admissions includes ticket sales for all of our events event related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship and naming rights fees sr naming rights agreement expired in  luxury suite rentals  event souvenir merchandise sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  advertising and other promotional revenues  radio programming  hospitality revenues  track rentals  driving school and karting revenues  camping and other non admission access revenues  broadcasting rights other than nascar broadcasting revenue  and other event and speedway related revenues nascar broadcasting revenue includes rights fees obtained for domestic television broadcasts of nascar sanctioned events held at our speedways other operating revenue includes certain merchandising revenues of smi properties and subsidiaries  car and part sales of us legend cars  restaurant  catering and membership income from the speedway clubs at cms and tms  revenues of oil chem  which produces an environmentally friendly micro lubricant  tms oil and gas mineral rights lease revenues  and industrial park and office rentals our revenue items produce different operating margins 
broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals produce higher margins than non event merchandise sales  as well as sales of us legend cars  oil chem  smi properties and subsidiaries or other operating revenues 
we classify our expenses  among other categories  as follows direct expense of events principally includes cost of souvenir sales  non nascar race purses and sanctioning fees  property and event insurance  compensation of event related employees  advertising  sales and admission taxes  cost of driving school and karting revenues  event settlement payments to non nascar sanctioning bodies and outside event support services nascar purse and sanction fees includes payments to  and portions of broadcasting revenues retained by  nascar for associated events held at our speedways other direct operating expense includes the cost of certain smi properties and subsidiaries merchandising  us legend cars  speedway clubs  oil chem and industrial park and office tower rental revenues along with our principal operations of motorsports racing and related events  our ancillary businesses are further described and categorized as non event motorsports related merchandise revenue  non motorsports merchandise revenue  and other revenue below 
the following table shows the composition of selected revenues for the three years ended december  in thousands admissions nascar broadcasting sponsorships other event related souvenir and other merchandise other total revenue speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents admissions our admissions revenues include ticket sales for our events at a wide range of prices  generally established based on spectator demand  economic conditions and  at times  cost of living increases 
although we sell many tickets in advance  we promote outdoor motorsports events and weather conditions surrounding these events can significantly affect sales of tickets  particularly because we promote a limited number of premier events 
nascar broadcasting we negotiate annual contracts with nascar for domestic television station and network broadcast coverage of all of our nascar sanctioned events 
nascar broadcasting revenue consists of rights fees obtained for domestic television broadcasts of nascar sanctioned events held at our speedways 
sponsorships our revenue from corporate sponsorships is received in accordance with negotiated contracts 
sponsors and the terms of sponsorships change from time to time 
sponsorships generally consist of event  official and facility naming rights agreements sr naming rights agreement expired in 
we have sponsorship contracts with many major manufacturing and consumer products companies and brands  and many include official sponsorship designations at our speedways and exclusive advertising and promotional rights in various sponsor product categories 
none of our individual sponsorship or naming rights contracts exceeded of total revenues in our marketing agreements sometimes include multiple specified elements such as sponsorships  tickets  hospitality  suites or on site advertising in varying combinations for one or more events or contract periods  although there is typically a predominant element 
our marketing agreements can be event  speedway or period specific  or pertain to multiple events  speedways or years 
other event related we derive other event related revenue from various marketing agreements for on site advertising  hospitality and other promotion related activities  and commissioned food and beverage sales during racing and non racing events  speedway catered hospitality receptions and private parties 
food and beverages are also sold to individual  group  corporate and other customers primarily in concession areas located on or near speedway concourses  other areas surrounding our speedway facilities  and in luxury suites  club style seating and food court areas located within the speedway facilities 
we also derive revenue from luxury suite rentals  parking and other event and speedway related activities 
our speedways and related facilities are frequently leased to others for use in driving schools  testing  research and development of race cars and racing products  concerts  settings for commercials and motion pictures  and other outdoor events 
we derive event related revenue from the sale of commercial time and other radio broadcast programming on prn 
we also receive revenue for ancillary broadcasts associated with nascar 
com  nascar radio  international and other media amounts received in were not significant 
none of our individual other event related contracts exceeded of total revenues in souvenir and other merchandise we derive event related revenue from sales of owned motorsports related souvenir merchandise and commissioned souvenir merchandise sales during racing and non racing events and in our speedway gift shops throughout the year 
souvenir merchandise is sold in concession areas located on or near speedway concourses and other areas surrounding our speedway facilities to individual  group  corporate and other customers 
fees and sales based commissions are paid to us by third party vendors to allow on site selling of merchandise and promotional items during our events and activities 
such revenues are generated primarily from smi properties and smi trackside event souvenir merchandising for our speedways and third party speedways motorsports event merchandise 
we derive other operating revenue from certain smi properties and subsidiaries  and legend cars operations non event  motorsports related merchandise 
we also derive other operating revenue from oil chem non motorsports merchandise 
other we derive other operating revenue from the speedway club at cms and the speedway club at tms together the speedway clubs dining and entertainment facilities  which serve individual  group  corporate and other clientele 
we also derive other operating revenue from leasing of sr s industrial park to individuals  corporate and other customers  including race teams and driving schools  from leasing of office towers located at several of our speedways to motorsports and non motorsports associated corporate and other customers  tms oil and gas mineral rights lease revenues  and from the sanctioning of us legend cars circuit races 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recognized approximately million of revenue in related to the two year tms oil and gas mineral rights lease 
the lease is scheduled to expire december and  at this time  we are uncertain if or when it may be extended

table of contents near term operating factors there are many factors that affect our growth potential  future operations and financial results  including the following operating factors that are discussed below or elsewhere as indicated 
significant items discussed elsewhere in indicated sections of this report first quarter issuance of additional senior notes and credit facility amendment  and planned second quarter redemption of senior notes and possible earnings charge discussed below in liquidity and note to the consolidated financial statements reduced interest costs anticipated from financing transactions and sizable long term debt repayments in and discussed below in liquidity estimated capital expenditures of to million compared to million in  representing sizable reductions compared to million in and many previous years discussed below in capital expenditures our long term  multi year contracted revenues are significant discussed above in business general overview new expanded multi year  multi platform nascar broadcasting rights agreement  and existing nascar broadcasting rights agreements discussed above in business industry overview ongoing improvements in our sport discussed above in business industry overview remaining interest in discontinued operation dissolved in first quarter discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements quarterly cash dividends on common stock discussed below in liquidity and capital resources dividends general factors and current operating trends our results for the race season reflect decreases in admissions  ancillary broadcasting rights  naming rights and other event related revenue categories 
management believes many of our revenue categories continue to be negatively impacted by declines in consumer and corporate spending from the recession  including high unemployment  high fuel  food and health care costs  difficult housing markets and other economic factors 
the strength and duration of recovery in the us economy currently remains uncertain 
possible changes in governmental taxing  regulatory  spending and other policy could significantly impact consumer spending  economic recovery and our future results 
government responses and actions may or may not successfully restore long term stability to the consumer and credit markets and improve economic conditions 
record state and federal budgetary deficits could result in government responses such as higher consumer and corporate income or other tax rates 
governmental spending deficits could lead to higher interest rates and continued difficult borrowing conditions for consumers and corporate customers 
whether or when these difficult conditions might further improve cannot be determined at this time 
see our risk factors for additional information on ongoing recessionary conditions  financial market disruptions and geopolitical risks 
most of our nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series event sponsorships for the racing season  and many for years beyond  are already sold 
many of our other sponsorships and corporate marketing contracts are for multiple years beyond for our events  similar to and  management has maintained many reduced ticket prices  and continues to offer extended payment terms to many ticket buyers although generally not beyond when events are held to help foster fan support and offset the ongoing impact of these adverse economic and market conditions 
many of our fans are purchasing tickets closer to event dates 
we have increased promotional campaigns to incentivize earlier ticket purchasing and season ticket package renewal 
smi s seasonal and event based business model results in relatively long revenue cycles because many tickets and event related revenues are sold in advance 
as such  it may take relatively longer for smi s results to again reflect sales growth as economic conditions improve 
while lower ticket prices and extended payment terms can affect operating margins and lengthen cash flow cycles as compared to historical levels  management believes these are prudent measures in the current operating environment 
much of the success of the sport of nascar racing has long been attributed to the enduring and unsurpassed loyalty of our fans and customer base 
while those long time fans are more important to us than ever  we recognize the importance of capturing the next generation of race fans as the average age of the general population and our traditional fan base increases 
we believe that a portion of the decline in attendance over the past few years can be attributed to that changing demographic 
we are  therefore  increasingly investing in new marketing approaches and leading edge technology to foster attendance by families  particularly those with younger children and teenagers 
we are investing in social media advertising  web based applications and interactive speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents digital systems to enhance pre race and during the race entertainment experiences that appeal to our younger demographic markets 
we are offering and expanding our family friendly and first time fan programs to help educate and engage patrons who are new to the sport 
we believe our initiatives  along with other factors discussed elsewhere  will encourage increased attendance  but are unable to quantify the timing or amount  if any  of that future impact 
new and existing nascar broadcasting rights agreements as further described above in business general overview and industry overview  much of our future revenues are already contracted under television broadcasting rights and other long term contracts 
we participate in the combined eight year nascar agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed channel for the domestic television broadcast rights to all nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events for through this eight year nascar broadcasting rights arrangement provides us with increases in annual contracted revenues through averaging per year 
our total contracted nascar broadcasting revenues are expected to approximate million for nascar recently announced it has reached an eight year  multi platform agreement with fox sports media group for the broadcasting and digital rights to nascar sprint cup series races and the entire camping world truck series along with practice and qualifying beginning in through we believe this new stronger contract bodes well for nascar s ongoing negotiations for the remaining portion of our sport s season  and reflects the increasing value of our premium media content 
as further described in our risk factors  a lack of competitiveness in sprint cup series races  the closeness of the championship points race  race car driver popularity  and the success of nascar racing in general  in any particular racing season  can also significantly impact our operating results 
these and similar factors can affect attendance at nascar sprint cup and nationwide racing events  as well as corporate marketing interest  that can significantly impact our operating results 
all of the aforementioned factors  among others  can have a material adverse impact on our future operating results  cash flows and growth 
however  management believes our strong operating cash flow will continue  and that ticket demand and corporate marketing and promotional spending will increase as the economy improves 
see business  industry overview for additional information on ongoing improvements in our sport 
the demand and appeal for motorsports entertainment in our markets has remained relatively strong even in challenging circumstances 
our corporate and other customers are increasingly involved in diversified non motorsports industries  demonstrating the high marketing value of financial involvement and sponsorship in nascar and other motorsports racing 
we believe expanding marketing demographics  the intensifying media coverage  as well as the industry s ongoing focus on enhancing nascar racing competition  provide us and nascar with many long term marketing and future growth opportunities 
earnings guidance in connection with our fourth quarter and full year earnings release  management provided full year guidance of per diluted share from continuing operations 
the range of earnings guidance reflects the continuing negative impact of difficult and uncertain economic conditions  including high unemployment and consumer costs 
higher fuel  health care and food costs and unemployment  among other items  could significantly impact our future results

as further described above in near term operating factors  management believes admissions  many event related revenue categories and other operating revenues continue to be negatively impacted by ongoing weak economic conditions 
we believe our financial performance has not been materially affected by inflation

we recognize revenues and operating expenses for all events in the calendar quarter in which conducted 
concentration of racing events in any particular future quarter  including speedway acquisitions  with attendant increases in overhead expenses  may tend to minimize operating income in respective future quarters 
for example  kys s annual nascar sprint cup race date was moved to the second quarter from the third quarter  one annual nascar sprint cup race at nhms was moved to the third quarter from the second quarter  and one annual nascar sprint cup race was realigned from a first quarter event at ams to a third quarter event at kys in these realignments significantly increase or decrease quarterly operating income  corresponding with the move of race dates between quarters 
racing schedules may change from time to time  which can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarters of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of our motorsports business 
we promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things 
although we sell a substantial number of tickets in advance of our larger events  poor weather conditions can have a negative effect on our operating results 
poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success or experience of past events 
for example  management believes admissions were negatively impacted by poor weather surrounding nascar racing events held at ams in  which included rescheduling of its nascar sprint cup race from sunday to tuesday 
for additional information  see risk factor bad weather adversely affects the profitability of our motorsports events and postponement or cancellation of major motorsports events could adversely affect us

contracted fees include anticipated cash payments to nascar and of broadcasting revenues to be retained by nascar as currently negotiated for both cash payments to  and amounts retained by  nascar as reflected above correspond with the reporting of nascar broadcasting revenues and nascar purse and sanction fees 
fees for years after have not yet been negotiated  could increase or decrease  and could change substantially should future race schedules change

at december   net deferred tax liabilities totaled million 
while primarily representing the tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities  the likely future reversal and payment of net deferred income tax liabilities could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
we anticipate that cash from operations and funds available through our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating needs through at least the next twelve months  including estimated planned capital expenditures  income tax liabilities  and repurchases of common stock or payment of future declared dividends  if any

most of our nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series event sponsorships for the racing season  and many for years beyond  are already sold

we also have significant contracted revenues under long term operating leases for various office  warehouse and industrial park space  track rentals and driving school activities with entities largely involved in motorsports 
we believe the substantial revenue generated under such long term contracts helps significantly solidify our financial strength  earnings and cash flows and stabilize our financial resilience and profitability during difficult economic conditions 
while these long term television broadcasting rights agreements existing and upcoming will likely result in annual revenue increases over the contract periods  associated annual increases in purse and sanction fees paid to nascar may continue 
we reduced total long term debt by million in and million in through principal repayment  facilitated in part by various financing transactions 
in the first quarter  we issued million of additional senior notes and amended our credit facility as further described below  and plan to redeem all outstanding million of senior notes in the second quarter proceeds from the additional offering were used to repay million of credit facility borrowings  and we plan to use borrowings under the credit facility  including term loan borrowings  to fund the planned redemption 
the terms and conditions of our debt agreements are further described below and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
although our and financing transactions did not substantially change our overall outstanding debt levels  interest costs under our credit facility have been  and will likely continue to be  substantially lower than under our senior notes  particularly the senior notes 
also  our amended credit facility contains lower adjustable interest rate tiers and less restrictive financial ratio covenants  and the structured repayment of term loan borrowings over five years is expected to reduce our indebtedness levels  leverage and future interest costs earlier than under our previous debt structure 
additional senior notes issued in at december   we had senior notes aggregating million in outstanding principal issued in may  that mature in february  and with interest payments due semi annually on february and august in january  we completed a million aggregate principal private placement add on offering to the existing senior notes 
these additional notes were issued at of par  and net proceeds after commissions and fees approximated million 
the proceeds were used to repay million of credit facility borrowings  representing all facility borrowings then outstanding  and the remainder used for general corporate purposes 
we plan to offer to exchange these notes for substantially identical notes registered under the securities act in the second quarter the add on notes are identical to the existing senior notes with the same interest rate  maturity  covenants  limitations  dividend  stock repurchases and redemption provisions and other terms and conditions  and are governed by the same indenture hereafter both issuances are referred to as the senior notes

we may also redeem some or all of the senior notes before february  at par plus a make whole premium 
in the event of a change of control  we must offer to repurchase the senior notes at of par value 
amendment of bank credit facility in in february  we amended our credit facility the credit facility which  among other things i provides for a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility  ii provides for a five year million senior secured term loan the term loan with a six month delayed draw period  iii matures in february  and iv allows us to increase revolving commitments or establish a term loan or a combination of the two up to an aggregate additional million with certain lender commitment conditions 
the credit facility also allows for motor speedway acquisitions and related businesses  allows for annual aggregate payments of dividends and common stock repurchases and other investments  limits annual capital expenditures  and includes negative covenant restrictions  indebtedness guarantees and security pledges generally the same as before amendment 
revolving loans may be borrowed and repaid from time to time subject to meeting certain conditions on the date borrowed 
interest is based  at our option  upon libor plus to or the bank of america s base rate plus to 
the credit facility also contains a commitment fee ranging from to of unused amounts available for borrowing  with lenders receiving at least a fee for six months on any delayed term loan borrowings until initially funded 
the interest rate margins on borrowings and the commitment fee are adjustable periodically based upon certain consolidated total leverage ratios 
the term loan requires minimum quarterly principal payments of at least of the initial amount drawn on an annualized basis or million in a twelve month period assuming an initial draw of million 
early redemption of senior notes planned in we plan to redeem all outstanding senior notes in aggregate principal of million in the second quarter the senior notes are scheduled to mature in june  and we can redeem the notes at a redemption premium of of par beginning june  and annually declining to par after june  we plan to use borrowings under the credit facility  including term loan borrowings  to fund the planned redemption 
also  cash on hand could be used to fund part of the planned redemption  including redemption premium or other transaction costs 
assuming all senior notes are redeemed as of june   we anticipate reflecting a material charge to earnings in the second quarter for associated redemption premium of million  unamortized net deferred loan costs of million  unamortized issuance discount of million  and settlement payment and transaction costs which presently are undeterminable

table of contents other general debt agreement terms and conditions our amended credit facility contains a number of affirmative and negative financial covenants  including requirements that we maintain certain ratios of funded debt to ebitda and ebit to interest expense 
our credit facility  and the indentures governing the senior notes and the senior notes  among other things  contain certain requirements and restrictive financial covenants and limitations on capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends  repurchase or issuance of smi securities  restricted payments  incurring other indebtedness  liens or pledging assets to third parties  mergers  transactions with affiliates  guarantees  investments  redemptions  disposition of property and entering into new lines of business 
our credit facility agreement  senior notes indenture and senior notes indenture contain cross default provisions 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  management believes the most restrictive financial covenant is the amended credit facility requirement for maintaining minimum financial ratios of earnings before interest and taxes ebit to interest expense  as defined 
the minimum required ratio is no less than to for the four fiscal quarters ending september   to for the four fiscal quarters ending september   and to for each fiscal quarter thereafter 
management actively monitors compliance with this and all other financial covenants 
if future operating results or events result in ratios below the required minimum  management is prepared to take certain actions to remain compliant 
such actions could include  for example  loan repayments or refinancing  reducing capital expenditures or operating expenses where practical  or obtaining loan compliance waivers 
however  we can provide no assurance that further deteriorations in our profitability or cash flows  or other unforeseen negative operating factors or conditions  would not result in non compliance with this or any other debt covenant 
any such non compliance could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition  operating results or cash flows  and our ability to maintain compliance can be affected by events beyond our control 
as further described in our risk factors  possible material adverse effects from non compliance could include  among others  cross default under any or all of our debt agreements and acceleration of all amounts outstanding 
stock repurchase program as previously described above  our stock repurchase program authorizes smi to repurchase up to an aggregate of million shares of our outstanding common stock  depending on market conditions  share price  applicable limitations under our various debt agreements  and other factors the board of directors or their designees  in their sole discretion  may consider relevant 
the stock repurchase program is presently funded using available cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we could repurchase up to an additional  shares under the current authorization 
capital expenditures we continually evaluate new opportunities that we believe will increase stockholder value 
at december   we had various construction projects underway 
similar to prior years  we plan to modernize and expand luxury suites and hospitality areas along certain speedway pit roads and grandstands  and install new billboards and other fan amenities at our speedway facilities 
we also plan to continue investing in social media and web application technology to attract and enhance the entertainment experience of our race fans 
as of december   contractual obligations for capital expenditures were not significant 
in  we completed construction of new luxury suites and premium pavilion  hospitality and fan zone entertainment areas along and close to cms s pit road and grandstands 
we ground a portion of bms s racing surface  and purchased land  constructed a pedestrian tunnel  expanded on site roads and available parking  and reconfigured traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow at kys 
we continued modernizing and expanding various concessions  luxury suites  camping and hospitality areas  restrooms and other fan amenities at our speedway facilities 
we also continued to invest in social media and web application technology to attract and enhance the entertainment experience of race fans 
in  capital expenditures amounted to million  representing a sizable reduction compared to million in and million in at this time  aggregate payments for capital expenditures in are estimated to approximate to million 
management plans to fund these capital expenditures with available cash and cash investments  working capital or borrowings under our credit facility as needed 
dividends any decision concerning the payment of quarterly or annual common stock dividends depends upon our results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans  applicable limitations under our various debt agreements  and other factors the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant

critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  including amounts that are susceptible to change 
we continually review our accounting policies and accounting estimates  and the application and effect on our financial statements and disclosures  for conformity with gaap  including relevance  accuracy  completeness and non omission of material information 
our critical accounting policies include accounting methods and estimates underlying such financial statement preparation  as well as judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies 
in applying critical accounting policies and making estimates  materially different amounts or results could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with risk factors  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the consolidated financial statements  including the associated notes  appearing elsewhere in this report 
as indicated below  certain accounting policies that are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements are not repeated in this section

table of contents described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we follow applicable authoritative guidance which specifies  among other things  nonamortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires testing for possible impairment at least annually 
when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred  we evaluate long lived assets  including tangible assets and intangible assets subject to amortization  for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows attributable to such assets using applicable authoritative guidance 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other assets and liabilities when assessing impairment 
when improvement projects produce a higher economic yield and require demolition of a component of a speedway facility  capitalization of demolition  construction and historical component costs are limited to the revised estimated value of the project 
nascar has announced it would consider potential track realignment of sprint cup series racing events to desirable  potentially more profitable market venues of speedway operators 
our annual impairment assessment did not consider the possibility that management may realign one or more other nascar sprint cup series racing events among its speedway facilities  which could result in net higher or improved future projected cash flows 
while relocation of any sprint cup event among our speedways we now or may own in the future could result in a net increase in our future operating profitability  long lived assets of a speedway from where a sprint cup racing event may move could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge that adversely affects our future financial condition or results of operations 
various business and other factors associated with recoverability and impairment considerations are also described in our risk factors above 
we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment annually in the second quarter  or when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred 
the methods and factors used in our annual impairment assessment are further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and are not repeated here 
management s latest annual assessment in the second quarter indicated the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and each indefinite lived intangible asset substantially exceeded its associated carrying value except for two reporting units 
as such  no goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges were found necessary at this time 
however  management s assessment found the estimated fair values for reporting units kys and nhms exceeded their carrying values by a relatively nominal amount with associated risk of failing step one of impairment testing 
the aggregate carrying value of goodwill for these two units  both acquired in  is approximately million 
estimated fair values for those units exceeded aggregate goodwill carrying values by at least based on projected discounted operating cash flows and profitability 
should these reporting units or their indefinite lived intangible assets not achieve projected cash flows or profitability  or should actual capital expenditures exceed current plans  estimated fair values could be reduced to below carrying values resulting in material non cash impairment charges 
among other factors  our assessment assumes economic and industry condition improvements  and projected cash flow and profitability recovery  to pre recession levels through modest annual growth rates for periods of approximately eight years depending on the associated projected revenue stream  and strategic amounts of planned capital expenditures 
we also assumed increases in contracted nascar television broadcasting rights revenues after that approximate those reflected in the recently negotiated eight year contract beginning in  as further described in business general overview and industry overview 
management s annual impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets  based predominately on management s best estimate of future discounted operating cash flows and profitability for all reporting units  considered the approved realignment of an annual nascar sprint cup racing event from ams to kys beginning in the third quarter realignment of the race date from ams to kys resulted in no impairment of intangible or other long lived assets 
however  the assessment indicated the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and each indefinite lived intangible asset exceeded its associated carrying value except for one reporting unit  nhms 
as such  a non cash impairment charge of million with no income tax benefit was reflected in to reduce goodwill related to nhms to estimated fair value 
we previously reported our annual evaluation had found the estimated fair value for this reporting unit exceeded carrying values 
the annual evaluation reflected lowered estimated future cash flows principally because of the severity and length of the recession extending beyond our previous forecast  reducing visibility on profitability recovery 
the impairment did not pertain to or affect the underlying value of our race date intangibles 
the profitability or success of our future capital projects is subject to numerous factors  conditions and assumptions  some of which are beyond our control  and if significantly negative or unfavorable  could become impaired and materially adversely affect our future financial condition or results of operations 
management believes our operational and cash flow forecasts support its conclusions 
management believes there have since been no events or circumstances which indicate possible impairment  and speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents that no unrecognized impairment of property and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets exists through or as of december  the evaluations are subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
different economic or industry conditions or assumptions  changes in projected cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the impairment evaluation and our future financial condition or results of operations 
depreciable and amortizable lives for property and equipment and intangible assets depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
we have net property and equipment of  million and insignificant net amortizable intangible assets as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our property and equipment  other intangible assets and estimated useful lives 
as of december   we have nonamortizable intangible assets of million and goodwill of million for race event sanctioning and renewal agreements that are considered to have indefinite useful lives because their renewal and cash flow generation are expected to continue indefinitely 
useful lives are estimated based on outside cost segregation and valuation studies conducted on purchased or constructed speedway property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  historical experience  intended use  condition  available information for comparable assets  and other factors and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
management periodically reviews the estimated useful lives used to record depreciation and amortization expense  and believes such estimated useful lives are appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
management also periodically reviews whether non amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets remains appropriate  and believes such non amortization is appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
however  because we have a material investment in depreciable property and equipment and intangible assets  changes in depreciable and amortizable lives  should they occur  could have a significant impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
realization of receivables and inventories management assesses realization of accounts and notes receivable and inventories  including any need for allowances for doubtful accounts or inventories 
management considers such factors as  among other things  customer creditworthiness  historical collection and sales experience for receivables  and current inventory levels  current and future market demand  and trends and conditions for inventories 
the assessment is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  which are subject to changes in market and economic conditions  including changes or deterioration in customer financial condition or merchandising distribution and other factors  that might adversely impact realization 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities assuming they will be realized and settled at amounts reported in the financial statements 
income taxes are provided using the liability method whereby deferred income tax estimates  and significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities  reflect management s assessment of future taxes likely to be paid  including timing  probability of realization and other relevant factors 
management s accounting for income taxes reflects its assessment of future tax liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing  likelihood of realization  and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation 
we have no undistributed foreign earnings or cash or cash equivalents held outside of the us 
at december   net current deferred tax assets totaled  and net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities totaled million  after reduction for noncurrent deferred tax assets of million 
these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
as of december   valuation allowances of million are provided against deferred tax assets 
management has assessed deferred tax assets  after reduction for valuation allowances  and believes realization is more likely than not 
however  changes in tax laws  assumptions or estimates used in the accounting for income taxes  or changes or adjustments resulting from review by taxing authorities  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  our lower tax rate reflects favorable recoveries and settlements with certain taxing authorities  and lower effective state income tax rates 
our substantially higher tax rate is due primarily to reflecting the goodwill impairment charge with no tax benefit  which was partially offset by the positive impact of net decreases in uncertain tax speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k

excluding the non deductible goodwill impairment charge  the effective income tax rate would have been 
our effective income tax rates in future years may or may not be impacted by similar or other tax matters  which could result in relative increases or decreases in future income tax expense 
legal proceedings and contingencies as discussed above in legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal matters and intend to continue to defend existing legal actions in fiscal we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedways  other properties and motorsports events  and other business risks 
see our risk factors for additional information on our liability insurance program and self insurance retention 
the likelihood of an adverse outcome and estimation of amounts are assessed using legal counsel on litigation matters  outside insurance administrators and consultants for insured and self insured claims  along with historical trends  assumptions and other information available at the time of assessment 
we accrue a liability for contingencies if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
legal and other costs associated with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
management believes amounts requiring accrual are properly reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
management does not believe the outcome of the lawsuits  incidents or other legal or business risk matters will have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  new or changes in pending or threatened legal action or claims against us  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of these matters and our future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
