executive overview our operations are organized  managed and classified into six reportable business segments grain  ethanol  plant nutrient  rail  turf specialty and retail 
each of these segments is based on the nature of products and services offered 
the agricultural commodity based business is one in which changes in selling prices generally move in relationship to changes in purchase prices 
therefore  increases or decreases in prices of the agricultural commodities that the business deals in will have a relatively equal impact on sales and cost of sales and a much less significant impact on gross profit 
as a result  changes in sales for the period may not necessarily be indicative of the overall performance of the business and more focus should be placed on changes to merchandising revenues and service income 
grain group our grain group operates grain elevators in various states in the us corn belt 
in addition to storage  merchandising and grain trading  grain performs marketing  risk management  and corn origination services to its customers and affiliated ethanol production facilities 
grain is a significant investor in lansing trade group  llc ltg  an established commodity trading  grain handling and merchandising business with operations throughout the country and with global trading merchandising offices 
this year has been significant for the grain group in terms of growth 
on december  our grain group completed the purchase of a majority of the grain and agronomy locations of green plains grain company  a subsidiary of green plains renewable energy  inc the purchase includes seven facilities in iowa and five in tennessee  with a combined grain storage capacity of about million bushels 
included in the acquisition was also  tons of fertilizer storage in iowa 
during  grain increased its storage capacity by approximately through construction of a grain shuttle loader facility in anselmo  nebraska and a business acquisition 
the total storage capacity is approximately million bushels as of december  compared to million bushels at december  in addition  it is reasonably possible that within the next months  the company may make additional investments in the agriculture industry 
grain inventories on hand at december  were million bushels  of which million bushels were stored for others 
this compares to million bushels on hand at december   of which million bushels were stored for others 
with early planting and the anticipation of a record corn crop  started out with high expectations for us growers 
however  the drought conditions encountered during the growing season resulted in significantly decreased corn yields 
for this reason  the drought had an unfavorable impact on space income for the grain business for the fourth quarter of and will likely impact space income into the first half of as well 
looking ahead  planted corn acreage is anticipated to be as high as million acres which should benefit our grain and other agricultural businesses 

table of contents ethanol group our ethanol business holds investments in four ethanol production facilities organized as separate limited liability companies  three of which are accounted for under the equity method the unconsolidated ethanol llcs and one that is consolidated the andersons denison ethanol llc or tade 
the business purchases and sells ethanol  offers facility operations  risk management  and ethanol  corn oil and distillers dried grains ddg marketing to the ethanol plants in which it invests in and operates  as well as third parties

the company holds a majority interest of 
previously owned by amaizing energy denison llc and amaizing energy holding company  llc  the operations consist of a million gallon capacity ethanol facility with an adjacent million bushel grain terminal  with direct access to two class railroads in iowa 
ethanol volumes shipped for the year ended december  and were as follows in thousdands twelve months ended december  ethanol gallons shipped e gallons shipped corn oil pounds shipped ddg tons shipped the ethanol llcs incurred operating losses for the year as a result of poor margins resulting from weak gasoline demand  an oversupply of ethanol and high corn costs caused by the drought 
looking ahead  we anticipate the first three quarters of being tough for the ethanol group due to regional corn shortages 
although the market is not indicating positive margins until the latter half of  there has been a recent improvement in margins 
in addition  a record corn planting in the spring should have positive benefits for our ethanol group in the last three to four months of the year 
of course  this is dependent on numerous external factors  such as favorable weather during the growing season

the company continues to identify opportunities to strategically grow the plant nutrient business 
on january   the company purchased of the stock of new eezy gro  inc neg for a purchase price of million

storage capacity at our wholesale nutrient and farm center facilities was approximately  tons for dry nutrients and approximately  tons for liquid nutrients at december  fertilizer tons shipped including sales and service tons for the years ended december  and were million tons and million tons  respectively 
the group had a strong fourth quarter due to the dry and warm fall weather which was ideal for fall nutrient application 
although margins were not as strong as in the prior year  volume was higher 
looking ahead  the reductions in crop volume and quality may cause continued rises in grain prices into and corn acres planted in are anticipated to be up to million acres  which should support good nutrient demand moving into the next crop cycle

ethanol inventories were significantly higher due to the acquisition of tade in the second quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in inventories of the plant nutrient businesses caused by lower levels of inventory and a decrease in the average cost 
restricted cash decreased as a result of reimbursement of spending related to an industrial development revenue bond 
see the discussion below on sources and uses of cash for an understanding of the change in cash from prior year 
commodity derivatives have also increased due to a rise in grain prices 
other current assets have increased primarily due to an increase in railcars available for sale and higher prepaid income tax 
current liabilities increased primarily as a result of an increase in grain and other accounts payable 
the increase in grain payables is partly attributed to higher hold pay for corn grain we have purchased but not yet paid for  but this account also tends to fluctuate with the timing of grain receipts along with variations in the prices of grain 
the increase in other accounts payable is consistent with the increase in cost of sales and merchandising revenues 
customer prepayments and deferred revenues 
table of contents increased primarily as a result of the movement of a liability to cargill for the marketing agreement due to be settled in commodity derivative liabilities also increased due to rising commodity prices 
these increases were partially offset by lower borrowings on our short term line of credit and a decrease in current maturities of long term debt see note for more information

investing activities investing activities used million compared to million used in there have been significant additions to property  plant and equipment in primarily related to business acquisitions  construction of a grain storage and load out facility and the phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning system 
in the third quarter  our grain group completed construction of a grain load out facility in anselmo  nebraska 
correspondingly  restrictions related to a substantial majority of cash received related to industrial revenue bonds for the project were released 
in total  we spent million on business acquisitions net of cash acquired in another large portion of the spending relates to purchases of railcars in the amount of million 
purchases of railcars were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of railcars in the amount of million 
capital spending for on property  plant and equipment includes grain million  ethanol million  plant nutrient million  rail million  turf specialty million  retail million and million in corporate enterprise resource planning project purchases 
we expect to spend approximately million in on conventional property  plant and equipment which includes estimated capital spending for the project to replace current technology with an enterprise resource planning system 
an additional million is estimated to be spent on the purchase and capitalized modifications of railcars with related sales or financings of million 
financing arrangements net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million cash used in financing activities in the increase was primarily driven by higher proceeds from issuance of long term debt offset partially by payments of long term debt during the year

table of contents certain of our long term borrowings include covenants that  among other things  impose minimum levels of equity and limitations on additional debt 
we are in compliance with all such covenants as of december  in addition  certain of our long term borrowings are collateralized by first mortgages on various facilities or are collateralized by railcar assets 
because the company is a significant consumer of short term debt in peak seasons and the majority of this is variable rate debt  increases in interest rates could have a significant impact on the profitability of the company 
in addition  periods of high grain prices and or unfavorable market conditions could require the company to make additional margin deposits on its exchange traded futures contracts

see the narrative description of businesses for the grain and ethanol groups in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
e other long term liabilities include estimated obligations under our retiree healthcare programs and the estimated contribution to our defined benefit pension plan 
obligations under the retiree healthcare programs are not fixed commitments and will vary depending on various factors  including the level of participant utilization and inflation 
our estimates of postretirement payments through have considered recent payment trends and actuarial assumptions 
we have not estimated pension contributions beyond due to the significant impact that return on plan assets and changes in discount rates might have on such amounts 
the company had standby letters of credit outstanding of million at december  as well as million that was outstanding on a non recourse basis 
off balance sheet transactions the company rail group utilizes leasing arrangements that provide off balance sheet financing for its activities 
the company leases railcars from financial intermediaries through sale leaseback transactions  the majority of which involve operating leasebacks 
railcars owned by the company  or leased by the company from a financial intermediary  are generally leased to a customer under an operating lease 
the company also arranges non recourse lease transactions under which it sells railcars or locomotives to a financial intermediary  and assigns the related operating lease to the financial intermediary on a non recourse basis 
in such arrangements  the company generally provides ongoing railcar maintenance and management 
table of contents services for the financial intermediary  and receives a fee for such services 
on most of the railcars and locomotives  the company holds an option to purchase these assets at the end of the lease

remaining lease terms vary with none exceeding fifteen years 
the company utilizes non recourse arrangements where possible in order to minimize its credit risk 
refer to note to the company consolidated financial statements in item for more information on the company leasing activities 
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and management knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may change from estimates 
certain of our accounting estimates are considered critical  as they are important to the depiction of the company financial statements and or require significant or complex judgment by management 
there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  however  they are not deemed critical as defined above 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item describes our significant accounting policies which should be read in conjunction with our critical accounting estimates 
management believes that accounting for fair value adjustment for counterparty risk  grain inventories and commodity derivative contracts  lower of cost or market inventory adjustments and impairment of long lived assets and equity method investments involve significant estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
grain inventories and commodity derivative contracts the company marks to market all grain inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts for grain and ethanol  over the counter grain and ethanol contracts  and exchange traded futures and options contracts 
the overall market for grain inventories is very liquid and active  market value is determined by reference to prices for identical commodities on the cme adjusted primarily for transportation costs  and the company grain inventories may be sold without significant additional processing 
the company uses forward purchase and sale contracts and both exchange traded and over the counter contracts such as derivatives generally used by the international swap dealers association 
management estimates fair value based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets  as well as counter party non performance risk in the case of forward and over the counter contracts 
the amount of risk  and therefore the impact to the fair value of the contracts  varies by type of contract and type of counter party 
with the exception of specific customers thought to be at higher risk  the company looks at the contracts in total  segregated by contract type  in its quarterly assessment of non performance risk 
for 
table of contents those customers that are thought to be at higher risk  the company makes assumptions as to performance based on past history and facts about the current situation 
changes in fair value are recorded as a component of sales and merchandising revenues in the statement of income 
lower of cost or market inventory adjustments the company records its non grain inventory at the lower of cost or market 
whenever changing conditions warrant  the company evaluates the carrying value of its inventory compared to the current market 
market price is determined using both external data  such as current selling prices by third parties and quoted trading prices for the same or similar products  and internal data  such as the company current ask price and expectations on normal margins 
if the evaluation indicates that the company inventory is being carried at values higher than the current market can support  the company will write down its inventory to its best estimate of net realizable value 
impairment of long lived assets and equity method investments the company business segments are each highly capital intensive and require significant investment in facilities and or railcars 
fixed assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
this is done by evaluating the recoverability based on undiscounted projected cash flows  excluding interest 
if an asset group is considered impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset group carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
we also annually review the balance of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter 
historically  these reviews for impairment have taken into account our quantitative estimates of future cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease terms  operating costs  life of the assets  potential disposition proceeds  budgets and long range plans 
the majority of our goodwill is in the grain and plant nutrient businesses 
based on the strength of performance in both of these groups  a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment was performed in the current year versus the traditional quantitative assessment 
key factors considered in the qualitative assessment included  but were not limited to industry and market specific factors  the competitive environment  comparison of the prior year actual results relative to budgeted performance  current financial performance  and managements forecast for future financial performance 
these factors are discussed in more detail in note  goodwill and intangible assets 
in addition  the company holds investments in limited liability companies that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the company reviews its investments to determine whether there has been a decline in the estimated fair value of the investment that is below the company carrying value which is other than temporary 
other than consideration of past and current performance  these reviews take into account forecasted earnings which are based on management estimates of future performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity prices the company daily net commodity position consists of inventories  related purchase and sale contracts and exchange traded futures and over the counter contracts 
the fair value of the position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures market prices 
the company has established controls to manage risk exposure  which consists of daily review of position limits and effects of potential market prices moves on those positions 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company exposure to market risk of its commodity position 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted market prices 
the result of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  is as follows december  in thousands net commodity position market risk 
table of contents interest rates the fair value of the company long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company current incremental borrowing rates and credit ratings for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
market risk  which is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one half percent decrease in interest rates  is summarized below december  in thousands fair value of long term debt fair value in excess of carrying value market risk actual results may differ 
the estimated fair value and market risk will vary from year to year depending on the total amount of long term debt and the mix of variable and fixed rate debt
