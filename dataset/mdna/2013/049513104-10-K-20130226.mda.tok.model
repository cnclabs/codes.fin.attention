we currently own and operate one wafer manufacturing facility in colorado springs  colorado  consistent with our strategic determination made several years ago to maintain lower fixed costs and capital investment requirements 
net revenue was lower in the year ended december   compared to net revenue in the year ended december   as we were adversely affected by a slowdown in the global economy and excess inventories held by our distributors  particularly in asia 
lower sales resulted in lower utilization rates for our colorado springs wafer facility  which increased our wafer costs and  as a consequence  adversely affected our gross margin 
in response to lower sales  we implemented cost reduction programs throughout our operations in the second half of  including labor cost reduction programs 
we expect to continue to monitor our cost structure to ensure that it is properly aligned with global economic conditions 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of our common stock in the open market and subsequently retired those shares under our existing stock repurchase program 
as of december   million remained available for repurchasing common stock under this program

employees may also participate in an employee stock purchase program that offers the ability to purchase stock through payroll withholdings at a discount to market price 
stock based compensation cost for stock options is based on the fair value of the award at the measurement date grant date 
the compensation amount for those options is calculated using a black scholes option valuation model 
for restricted stock unit awards  the compensation amount is determined based upon the market price of our common stock on the grant date 
stock based compensation for restricted stock units  other than performance based units described below  is recognized as an expense over the applicable vesting term for each employee receiving restricted stock units 
the recognition as expense of the fair value of performance related stock based awards is determined based upon management s estimate of the probability and timing for achieving the associated performance criteria  utilizing the fair value of the common stock on the grant date 
stock based compensation for performance related awards is recognized over the estimated performance period  which may vary from period to period based upon management s estimates of achievement and the timing to achieve the related performance goals

these vested performance based restricted stock units had a weighted average grant date fair value of per share on the vesting date 
we recorded total stock based compensation expense related to performance based restricted stock units of million and million under the plan in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the plan performance metrics include revenue growth rankings for us relative to a semiconductor peer group or a microcontroller peer group  as determined by the compensation committee 
in addition  in order for a participant to receive credit for a performance period  we must achieve a minimum operating margin during such performance period  measured on a pro forma basis as defined in the plan  subject to adjustment by the compensation committee 
we evaluate  on a quarterly basis  the likelihood of meeting our performance metrics in determining stock based compensation expense for performance share plans 
to the extent that aspects of a performance based compensation plan such as ours are adjusted in the discretion of a compensation committee  the exercise of that discretion  notwithstanding that it is expressly permitted by the terms of a plan  may result in plan compensation awarded to named executive officers not being deductible 
our compensation committee has retained the discretion to implement our plan  notwithstanding any potential loss of deductibility  in the manner that it believes most effectively achieves the objectives of our compensation philosophies 
until restricted stock units are vested  they do not have the voting rights of common stock and the shares underlying the awards are not considered issued and outstanding

asset impairment charges we assess the recoverability of long lived assets with finite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset carrying amount 
we measure the amount of impairment of such long lived assets by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair market value of the asset  which is generally determined based on projected discounted future cash flows or appraised values 
we classify long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale as held and used until they are disposed  including assets not available for immediate sale in their present condition 
we report assets and liabilities to be disposed of by sale as held for sale and recognize those assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated 
for the year ended december  we determined that certain assets should instead remain with us 
as a result  we reclassified property and equipment to held and used in the quarter ended june  in connection with this reclassification  we assessed the fair value of these assets to be retained and concluded that the fair value of the assets was lower than their carrying value less depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used 
as a result  we recorded additional asset impairment charges of million in the second quarter of see note for further discussion

loss from european foundry arrangements in december  a subsidiary entered into a take or pay agreement to purchase wafers from a european foundry that had acquired one of our former european manufacturing operations 
in connection with the anticipated expiration of this agreement  we notified customers  in the fourth quarter of  of our end of life process and requested that customers provide to us last time buy orders 
to the extent that we believe we have excess wafers that remain after satisfying anticipated customer demand  we estimated a probable loss for those excess wafers  which was approximately million 
we  therefore  recorded a charge in that amount to our cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  in june  in connection with the sale of one of our former european manufacturing operations  one of our subsidiaries leased facilities to the acquirer of those operations and have charged that acquirer for rent and other occupancy costs 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a loss of million on receivables from that tenant based on financial and other circumstances affecting the collectibility of those receivables  which is reflected under the caption impairment of receivables from foundry supplier in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  credit from reserved grant income in march  the greek government executed a ministerial decision related to an outstanding state grant previously made to a greek subsidiary 
consequently  we recognized a benefit of million in our results for the three months ended march  resulting from the reversal of a reserve previously established for that grant 
interest and other expense income  net years ended december  december  december  in thousands interest and other expense income interest expense foreign exchange transaction gains total interest and other expense  net  for the year ended december  resulted in an expense of million when compared to the same period in  primarily related to a write off from a private company investment of million and an other than temporary impairment charge of million related to an equity investments 
the decrease in foreign exchange transaction gains for the year ended december  was primarily due to changes to our foreign exchange exposures from intercompany balances between our subsidiaries compared to the year ended december  we continue to have balance sheet exposures in foreign currencies subject to exchange rate fluctuations and may incur further gains or losses in the future as a result of such foreign exchange exposures 
provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for benefit from income taxes of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  the significant components of the tax provision were from operations in jurisdictions with operating profits 
our effective tax rate for the years ended december  and was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of  primarily due to income recognized in lower tax rate jurisdictions and the recognition of foreign r d credits 
for the year ended december   the significant components of the tax benefit were the favorable settlement of the irs tax audit  the release of valuation allowances attributable to deferred tax assets  and the recognition of certain us foreign tax credits and foreign r d credits 
similar to our position during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  except certain assets related to state net operating losses and state tax credits  including r d credit carry forwards 
as a result  we continue to provide a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets relating to those items for year ended december  
table of contents the tax attribute carryforwards as of december  consist of the following tax attribute december  nature of expiration in thousands foreign net operating loss carry forwards beginning of state net operating loss carry forwards federal r d credits  net of those related to stock option deductions beginning of federal r d credits related to stock option deductions beginning of state r d credits indefinite foreign tax credits beginning of state investment tax credits beginning of foreign r d credits refundable we believe we may not be able to utilize portions of net operating loss carry forwards in non us jurisdictions before they expire  starting in included in the unrealized tax benefits utbs at december   and  are million  million and million  respectively  of tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
also included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at december   and  are million  million and million  respectively  of tax benefits that  if recognized  would result in adjustments to other tax accounts  primarily deferred tax assets 
currently  we have tax audits in progress in various other foreign jurisdictions 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different from the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
we believe that before december   it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or the statutes of limitations relating to certain income tax examination periods will expire  or both 
as such  after we reach settlement with the tax authorities  we expect to record a corresponding adjustment to our unrecognized tax benefits 
given the uncertainty as to settlement terms  the timing of payments and the impact of such settlements on other uncertain tax positions  the range of estimated potential decreases in underlying uncertain tax positions is between and million in the next months 
the calculation of unrecognized tax benefits involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we regularly assess our tax positions in light of legislative  bilateral tax treaty  regulatory and judicial developments in the countries in which we do business 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  our current asset to liability ratio  calculated as total current assets divided by total current liabilities  was at december  compared to at december  working capital  calculated as total current assets less total current liabilities  decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  and capital expenditures totaled million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  with the decrease resulting primarily from a reduction in the purchase of testing equipment in as of december   of the million aggregate cash and cash equivalents and short term investments held by us  the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was million 
if the funds held by our foreign subsidiaries were needed for our operations in the united states  the repatriation of some of these funds to the united states could require payment of additional us taxes 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was determined primarily by adjusting net income of million for certain non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation charges of million

in addition  operating cash flows were reduced by inventory build during the year of million as a result of higher build rates to support increased revenue  due to our transition to foundry suppliers with minimum delivery requirements and a decline in shipments in the second half of 
table of contents accounts receivable decreased by or million to million at december   from million at december  the average number of days of accounts receivable outstanding decreased to days for year ended december  from days for the year ended december  inventories decreased to million at december  from million at december  inventories consist of raw wafers  purchased foundry wafers  work in process and finished units 
our number of days of inventory decreased to days for the three months ended december  from days for the three months ended december  as a result of the sale of our serial flash product lines in september  inventories were reduced by million  of which million was transferred to the buyer at the time of sale 
we also granted the buyer an exclusive option to purchase our remaining million of serial flash inventory 
as of december   million of that inventory had not yet been purchased 
we expect the remaining million to be purchased in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we paid million for acquisitions of fixed assets as compared to million in the year ended december  resulting principally from reduced purchases of testing equipment 
for the year ended december   we paid million for acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired  as compared to million for the year ended december  we also received million in cash from the sale of our serial flash product lines during the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we paid million for acquisitions of fixed assets  million for intangible assets and million  net of cash acquired  for an acquisition we completed  offset in part by net proceeds of million from the sale of our former corporate headquarters 
we anticipate expenditures for capital purchases in to be relatively consistent with  and to be used principally to maintain existing manufacturing operations and to expand manufacturing capacity for our xsense product 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively

we believe our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  available equipment lease financing  and other short term and medium term bank borrowings that we believe would be available to us  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements over the next twelve months 
since a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through our foreign subsidiaries  our cash flow  ability to service debt  and payments to vendors are partially dependent upon the liquidity and earnings of our subsidiaries as well as the distribution of those earnings  or repayment of loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries  to us 
our foreign subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and may be subject to local legal or tax requirements  or other restrictions that may limit their ability to transfer funds to other group entities including the us parent entity  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
during the next twelve months  we expect our operations to continue to generate positive cash flow 
however  a portion of cash balances may be used to make capital expenditures  repurchase common stock  or make acquisitions 
during and in future years  our ability to make necessary capital investments or strategic acquisitions will depend on our ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to obtain adequate financing if necessary 
we believe we have sufficient working capital to fund our future operations with million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  together with expected future cash flows from operations

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income asc topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the amendments from this update will result in more converged guidance on how comprehensive income is presented under us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
with this update to asc  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
the amendments in this update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income  nor does it affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
previously  us gaap allows reporting entities three alternatives for presenting other comprehensive income and its components in financial statements 
one of those presentation options was to present the components 
table of contents of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this update eliminated that option 
the amended guidance also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the amendments in this asu should be applied retrospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  on october  the fasb decided to propose a deferral of the requirement to present reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement and on february   the fasb finalized this requirement for public entities beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement asc topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
the amendments in this asu result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements under us gaap and ifrs 
consequently  the amendments describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements as well as improving consistency in application across jurisdictions to ensure that us gaap and ifrs fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are described in the same way 
the asu also provides for certain changes in current gaap disclosure requirements  for example with respect to the measurement of level assets and for measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity shareholders equity 
the amendments in this asu are to be applied prospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems and distributors and recognize revenue when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
allowances for sales returns and other credits are recorded at the time of sale 
contracts and customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer payment history 
sales terms do not include post shipment obligations except for product warranty  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for sales to certain distributors primarily based in the us and europe with agreements allowing for price protection and product returns  historically we have not had the ability to estimate future claims at the point of shipment  and given that price is not fixed or determinable at that time  revenue is not recognized until the distributor sells the product to its end customer 
for sales to independent distributors in asia  excluding japan  we invoice these distributors at full list price upon shipment and issue a rebate  or credit  once product has been sold to the end customer and the distributor has met certain reporting requirements 
after reviewing the more limited pricing  rebate and quotation related terms  we concluded that we could reliably estimate future credits or rebates  therefore  we recognize revenue at the point of shipment for our asian distributors  assuming all of the other revenue recognition criteria are met  utilizing amounts invoiced  less estimated future credits or rebates 
our revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving accurate and timely data from our distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data  we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors reported inventories to their activities 
actual results could vary from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we must make estimates of potential future product returns and revenue adjustments related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends in the semiconductor industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
if management made 
table of contents different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenue may result 
we provide for sales returns based on our customer experience and our expectations for revenue adjustments based on economic conditions within the semiconductor industry 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimate of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing specific customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts and current economic trends 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million  respectively 
income taxes in calculating our income tax expense  it is necessary to make certain estimates and judgments for financial statement purposes that affect the recognition of tax assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would decrease income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we evaluate both positive and negative evidence that may exist and consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
our income tax calculations are based on application of the respective us federal  state or foreign tax law 
our tax filings  however  are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities 
accordingly  we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different from the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
valuation of inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
cost includes labor  including stock based compensation costs  materials  depreciation and other overhead costs  as well as factors for estimated production yields and scrap 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods 
we primarily utilize selling prices in our period ending backlog for measuring any potential declines in market value below cost 
any adjustment for market value provision is charged to cost of revenue at the point of market value decline 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted sales levels by product and other factors  including  but not limited to  competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product lifecycles 
actual demand may be lower  or market conditions less favorable  than those projected by us 
this difference could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin should inventory write downs beyond those initially recorded become necessary 
alternatively  should actual demand and market conditions be more favorable than those estimated by us  gross margin could be favorably impacted 
we adjust the cost basis for inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
obsolescence is determined based on several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles 
increases to the provision for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenue 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower cost inventory is subsequently sold  it will result in lower costs and higher gross margin for those products 
fixed assets we review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or disposition 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant negative industry or 
table of contents economic trends  ii exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  iii current  historical or projected losses that demonstrated continuing losses associated with an asset  iv significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net book value  v recent changes in our manufacturing model  and vi management assessment of future manufacturing capacity requirements 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions  which require our judgment  including  but not limited to  future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets  future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes 
in addition  we must use our judgment in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 
our business requires investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly underutilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 
we estimate the useful life of our manufacturing equipment  which is the largest component of our fixed assets  to be five years 
we base our estimate on our experience with acquiring  using and disposing of equipment over time 
depreciation expense is a major element of our manufacturing cost structure 
we begin depreciation on new equipment when it is ready for its intended use 
the aggregate amount of fixed assets under construction for which depreciation was not being recorded was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in  we early adopted asu intangibles goodwill and other and performed an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less that their carrying value 
based on the carrying amount of our reporting units and our assessment of certain qualitative factors including current macroeconomic  industry and market conditions  we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying amount 
purchased intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset carrying amount 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on an income approach  whereby we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  which are formed by evaluating operating plans 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments 
the assumptions used in the fair value calculation change from year to year and include revenue growth rates  operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
stock based compensation we determine the fair value of options on the measurement date utilizing an option pricing model  which is affected by our common stock price as well as a change in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  as well as the projected employee option exercise behaviors during the expected period between the stock option vesting date and the stock option exercise date 
for performance based restricted stock units  we are required to assess the probability of achieving certain financial objectives at the end of each reporting period 
based on the assessment of this probability  which requires subjective judgment  we record stock based compensation expense before the performance criteria are actually fully achieved  which may then be reversed in future periods if we determine that it is no longer probable that the objectives will be achieved 
the expected cost of each award is reflected over the performance period and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the fair value of a restricted stock unit is equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the measurement date 
restructuring charges our restructuring accruals include primarily payments to employees for severance  termination fees associated with leases  other contracts and other costs related to the closure of facilities 
accruals are recorded when management has approved a plan to restructure operations and a liability has been incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded 
these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded 
litigation we accrue for losses related to litigation  including intellectual property  commercial and other litigation  if a loss is probable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether accruals for litigation should be made 
if we were to determine that such a liability was probable and could be reasonably estimated  the adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities whose values are dependent upon short term interest rates 
we generally classify these securities as available for sale  and consequently record them on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being recorded as a separate part of stockholders equity 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
given our current profile of interest rate exposures and the maturities of our investment holdings  we believe that an unfavorable change in interest rates would not have a significant negative impact on our investment portfolio or statements of operations through december  foreign currency risk when we take an order denominated in a foreign currency we will receive fewer dollars  and lower revenue  than we initially anticipated if that local currency weakens against the dollar before we ship our product 
conversely  revenue will be positively impacted if the local currency strengthens against the dollar before we ship our product 
costs may also be affected by foreign currency fluctuation 
for example  in europe  where we have costs denominated in european currencies  costs will decrease if the local currency weakens 
conversely  all costs will increase if the local currency strengthens against the dollar 
this impact is determined assuming that all foreign currency denominated transactions that occurred for the year ended december  were recorded using the average foreign currency exchange rates in the year ended december  we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency risk 
changes in foreign exchange rates have historically had an effect on our net revenue and operating costs 
net revenue denominated in foreign currencies was  and of our total net revenue for the years ended december   and costs denominated in foreign currencies were  and of our total costs for the years ended december   and  respectively 
average exchange rates utilized to translate foreign currency revenue and expenses in euros were approximately  and euros to the dollar for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable overall effect on our operating results 
our net revenue for the year ended december  would have been approximately million higher had the average exchange rate in the current year remained the same as the average rate in effect for the year ended december  our income from operations would have been approximately million higher had the average exchange rate in the year ended december  remained the same as the average exchange rate in the ended december  for the year ended december   changes in foreign exchange rates had a favorable overall effect on our operating results 
our net revenue for the year ended december  would have been approximately million lower had the average exchange rate in the current year remained the same as the average rate in effect for the year ended december  our income from operations would have been approximately million lower had the average exchange rate in the year ended december  remained the same as the average exchange rate in the ended december  we also face the risk that our accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies will be devalued if such foreign currencies weaken quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts receivable were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
similarly  we face the risk that our accounts payable and debt obligations denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately and of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currencies at both december  and all of our debt obligations were denominated in foreign currencies at both december  and we have not historically sought to hedge our foreign currency exposure  although we may determine to do so in the future 
there remains ongoing uncertainty regarding the future of the euro as a common currency and the eurozone 
while we continue to monitor the situation  the elimination of the euro as a common currency  the withdrawal of member states from the eurozone or other events affecting the liquidity  volatility or use of the euro could have a significant effect on our revenue and operations 
liquidity and valuation risk approximately million and million of our investment portfolio is invested in auction rate securities at december  and december   respectively
