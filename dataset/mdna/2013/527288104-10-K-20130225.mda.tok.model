medical product development business description at december   the company owned approximately of sangart  a development stage biopharmaceutical company principally engaged in developing medicines designed to enhance the oxygenation of oxygen deprived tissues through targeted oxygen delivery 
the company has invested an aggregate of  in sangart  principally to help fund sangart s ongoing product development activities and overhead costs 
sangart became a consolidated subsidiary in  the net book value of the company s investment in sangart was  at december  in  sangart commenced human clinical trials of mpox  a solution of cell free hemoglobin administered intravenously to provide rapid oxygen delivery to ischemic oxygen deprived tissues 
the basis for sangart s technology is the result of more than years of research in the understanding of how hemoglobin the oxygen carrier in red blood cells functions outside of red blood cells in a cell free environment and how it can be used in conjunction with normal red blood cells to enhance oxygen delivery to organ tissue 
mp products are made from purified human hemoglobin that is extracted from fully screened and tested outdated human blood obtained from accredited blood centers  which is then bound to polyethylene glycol molecules using sangart s proprietary processes 
sangart owns or exclusively licenses nineteen us patents and has more than thirty applications pending worldwide covering product composition  manufacturing or methods of use 
patents applicable to the mp technology do not begin to expire until sangart recently completed a phase clinical trial of mpox in trauma patients 
the study was conducted at more than hospitals in countries 
the primary efficacy goal of the study was not met  as the mpox treated group did not show a statistically significant improvement in the number of patients discharged and alive after days as compared to the control group that received normal standard of care treatment 
but clinically significant improvements were observed in some other measures of efficacy and no significant safety concerns were identified 
sangart is now evaluating plans for its next clinical trial of mpox in trauma patients 
sangart also recently completed a phase b clinical trial of its mpco product in sickle cell disease patients not currently in crisis 
study results are considered to be successful and capable of supporting sangart s plans to conduct a phase clinical study involving sickle cell disease patients in crisis 
if this phase study was to be successful  sangart would then have to conduct a phase clinical study in sickle cell patients 
completing these studies will take several years at substantial cost and until they are successfully completed  if ever  sangart will not be able to request marketing approval and generate revenues from sales in either the trauma or the sickle cell disease markets 
in addition to obtaining requisite regulatory approvals for the manufacture and sale of mp products  including approval of a manufacturing facility which has yet to be built  sangart would have to create sales  marketing and distribution capabilities prior to any commercial launch  either directly or in partnership with a service provider 
in recent years  substantially all of the funding needed for mp development has come from the company 
significant additional funding will be needed prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch  the company is not committed to provide such funding and sangart is currently exploring potential external sources of funding and support 
any successful commercialization of mp products will depend on an adequate supply of raw materials  principally human red blood cells and polyethylene glycol  at an acceptable quality  quantity and price 
sangart has contracted for a supply of human red blood cells that is expected to be sufficient to produce mp at volumes needed for a commercial launch  however  if the product is successful additional sources of red blood cells will be needed to support sales growth 
commitments for quantities of polyethylene glycol to support a commercial launch have not yet been secured 
government regulation as a product intended for medical use  clinical trials  marketing approval  manufacturing and distribution of mp is highly regulated 
an application for marketing approval may only be made after the safety and effectiveness of the product has been demonstrated  including through human clinical trial data 
in the us  the fda regulates medical products  including the category known as biologics  which includes mp products 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act govern the testing  manufacture  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of mp products 
in europe  each country has its own agency that regulates clinical trials 
however  the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp  which is administered by the european medicines agency  is an eu wide regulatory body

energy projects during the past few years  the company has been incurring costs to investigate and evaluate the development of a number of large scale domestic energy projects 
these projects plan to use gasification technology to convert different types of low grade fossil fuels into clean energy products 
the company has also invested in certain energy projects that do not plan to use gasification technologies 
the company has expensed costs to investigate  evaluate and obtain various permits and approvals for its various energy projects of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
although there are a number of large scale projects the company is currently investigating  the company is not obligated to develop any of the projects  and no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in fully developing any of these projects 
any project that the company might develop would likely require a significant equity investment  which the company presently does not intend to fund by itself  the acquisition of substantial non recourse borrowings to build the projects total development costs for these types of projects range from billion to billion  the procurement of purchase commitments for long term supplies of feedstock  long term commitments from purchasers of the output  various permits and regulatory approvals and significant technological and engineering expertise to implement 
the investigation  evaluation and financing of these large scale projects will take years to complete 
the company is currently evaluating the development of a gasification project which would be built in louisiana by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  lake charles clean energy  llc lcce  for an estimated total cost of between  and  lcce has been awarded  in tax exempt bonds to support the development of the project  which would be issued by the lake charles harbor and terminal district of lake charles  louisiana   of investment tax credits and received a  federal government grant for carbon capture and sequestration 
receipt of these awards and grants are contingent upon satisfaction of numerous regulatory and other conditions 
the company is not obligated to make equity contributions to lcce until it completes its investigation  the project is approved by the company s board of directors and significant financing has been obtained from third parties  which has not yet been arranged 
the lake charles project is a new chemical manufacturing facility that plans to use proven quench gasification technology to produce various products from petroleum coke  a low grade solid fuel source 
the primary products to be produced by the lake charles project include methanol and hydrogen 
lcce has entered into offtake agreements for the majority of its production  and has also entered into a year contract for the sale of its entire carbon dioxide by product stream which would be used for enhanced oil recovery 
in july  two of the company s other prospective gasification projects  one in indiana and the other in mississippi  were selected by the us department of energy doe to proceed to detailed due diligence and negotiations of terms and conditions necessary for the doe to issue conditional commitments for loan guarantees aggregating up to  while these commitments represent important milestones in the selection process  the guarantees are subject to detailed and extensive due diligence by the doe and no assurance can be given that a loan guaranty for either project will ultimately be given 
a subsidiary of the company acquired a leasehold interest and certain permits to construct and operate an onshore liquefied natural gas lng terminal and associated facilities in warrenton  oregon 
the project would include construction of an offshore dock and berth and onshore facilities to store up to  cubic meters of lng 
the current plan includes construction of an approximate mile long natural gas pipeline to connect to the us natural gas transmission grid 
due to the recent increases in us natural gas production  lng receiving and storage facilities now only play a role in niche markets  where insufficient pipeline infrastructure can create short term shortages  therefore  the company has altered its strategy to focus on lng exports rather than lng imports 
a pre filing request for an lng export terminal was submitted to the federal energy regulatory commission in the company has also applied for and received from the doe a license to export natural gas to free trade agreement countries 
numerous regulatory permits and approvals and acquisitions of rights of way for the terminal and the pipeline will be required before project construction can commence  construction of the terminal and associated facilities could potentially begin in completion of the project is also subject to obtaining significant financing from third parties  which has not been arranged

our business is subject to a number of risks 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors  together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report  before you decide whether to purchase our common stock 
the risks set out below are not the only risks we face 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
future acquisitions and dispositions of our operations and investments are possible  changing the components of our assets and liabilities  and if unsuccessful could reduce the value of our common shares 
any future acquisitions or dispositions may result in significant changes in the composition of our assets and liabilities 
consequently  our financial condition  results of operations and the trading price of our common shares may be affected by factors different from those affecting our financial condition  results of operations and trading price at the present time 
the change of principal executive officers of leucadia that will occur if the jefferies merger is consummated may cause leucadia s investment results to be less successful than in the past 
the company has been dependent upon the services of its current principal executive officers  ian m 
cumming and joseph s 
steinberg  for more than years 
as a result of the jefferies merger  richard b 
handler will become chief executive officer and brian p 
friedman will become president of the company  while continuing their current positions as the principal executive officers of jefferies after the jefferies merger is consummated 
leucadia s financial condition  results of operations and trading price of its shares may be adversely affected if future investments under the new leadership are not successful 
for a discussion of additional risk factors related to the company following completion of the jefferies merger  see exhibit filed herewith and incorporated herein 
we operate in a variety of industries and market sectors  all of which are very competitive and susceptible to economic downturns and have been adversely affected by recent economic conditions 
the company operates in industries that sell commodity products and services  including beef processing and manufacturing  which are very competitive with product pricing often being the most significant factor to customers 
certain industries have seen a consolidation of the customer base  which tends to increase competition and pricing pressure 
in addition  starting in  the recession and general economic conditions have adversely affected operating results in the manufacturing  gaming entertainment and domestic real estate segments  which is likely to continue until the economy fully recovers 
the performance of these business units during this period has resulted in a lower valuation for these businesses  and a worsening of general economic or market conditions could result in a further deterioration in the values of our businesses or investments 
the prices and availability of key raw materials affects the profitability of our beef processing and manufacturing operations  and also impacts sangart s ability to conduct its clinical trials 
the supply and market price of cattle purchased by national beef are dependent upon a variety of factors over which national beef has no control  including fluctuations in the size of herds maintained by producers  the relative cost of feed and energy  weather and livestock diseases 
sangart has access to sufficient raw materials to conduct its clinical trials  however  it has not secured commitments for sufficient raw materials for a commercial launch  which would also require additional investments in manufacturing capacity 
the cost of polypropylene  the principal raw material used by conwed plastics  has increased by approximately over the last three years  a continuing trend that started in the price of polypropylene has historically fluctuated with the price of oil and natural gas but growing economies in china and india have resulted in increased demand and impacted prices 
although the company s operating subsidiaries are not currently experiencing any shortage of raw materials  if the subsidiaries experience shortages  revenues and profitability could decline 
outbreaks of disease affecting livestock can adversely affect the supply of cattle and the demand for national beef s products 
national beef is subject to risks relating to animal health and disease control 
an outbreak of disease affecting livestock such as foot and mouth disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse  commonly referred to as mad cow disease could result in restrictions on sales of products  restrictions on purchases of livestock from suppliers or widespread destruction of cattle 
the discovery of bse in the past caused certain countries to restrict or prohibit the importation of beef products 
outbreaks of diseases  or the perception by the public that an outbreak has occurred  or other concerns regarding diseases  can lead to inadequate supply  cancellation of orders by customers and create adverse publicity  any of which can have a significant negative impact on consumer demand and  as a result  on the company s consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
if national beef s products or products made by others using its products become contaminated or are alleged to be contaminated  national beef may be subject to product liability claims that could adversely affect its business 
national beef may be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance policy limits if its products or products made by others using its products causes injury  illness or death 
in addition  national beef could recall or be required to recall products that are  or are alleged to be  contaminated  spoiled or inappropriately labeled 
organisms producing food borne illnesses such as e 
coli could be present in national beef s products and result in illness or death if they are not eliminated through further processing or cooking 
contamination of national beef s or its competitors products may create adverse publicity or cause consumers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of beef products 
allegations of product contamination may also be harmful even if they are untrue or result from third party tampering 
any of these events may increase costs or decrease demand for beef products  any of which could have a significant adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
national beef generally does not enter into long term contracts with customers  as a result the volumes and prices at which beef products are sold are subject to market forces 
national beef s customers generally place orders for products on an as needed basis and  as a result  their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future 
the loss of one or more significant customers  a significant decline in the volume of orders from customers or a significant decrease in beef product prices for a sustained period of time could negatively impact cash flows and results of operations 
national beef s international operations expose it to political and economic risks in foreign countries  as well as to risks related to currency fluctuations 
approximately of national beef s annual sales are export sales  primarily to mexico  japan  south korea  canada  china for hides  hong kong  egypt  and taiwan  and on average these sales have a higher margin than domestic sales of similar products 
a reduction in international sales could adversely affect revenues and margins 
risks associated with international activities include inflation or deflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates  including changes in currency exchange rates of other countries that may export beef products in competition with national beef  the closing of borders by foreign countries to product imports due to disease or other perceived health or food safety issues  exchange controls  changes in tariffs  changes in political or economic conditions  trade restrictions and changes in regulatory requirements 
the occurrence of any of these events could increase costs  lower demand for products or limit operations  which could have a significant adverse effect on cash flows  results of operations and future prospects 
national beef incurs substantial costs to comply with environmental regulations and could incur additional costs as a result of new regulations or compliance failures that result in civil or criminal penalties  liability for damages and negative publicity 
national beef s operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental regulations administered by the epa and state  local and other authorities with regards to water usage  wastewater and storm water discharge  air emissions and odor  and waste management and disposal 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have serious consequences  including criminal  civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity 
in addition  national beef incurs and will continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with existing and new or more stringent regulations and requirements 
all of national beef s processing facilities procure wastewater treatment services from municipal or other regional governmental agencies that are in turn subject to environmental laws and permit limits regarding their water discharges 
as permit limits are becoming more stringent  upgrades and capital improvements to these municipal treatment facilities are likely 
in locations where national beef is a significant volume discharger  it could be asked to contribute toward the costs of such upgrades or to pay significantly increased water or sewer charges to recoup such upgrade costs 
national beef may also be required to undertake upgrades and make capital improvements to its own wastewater pretreatment facilities  the cost of which could be significant 
compliance with environmental regulations has had and will continue to have a significant impact on national beef s cash flows  margins and profitability 
in addition  under most environmental laws  most notably the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and analogous state laws  national beef could be held liable for the cost to investigate or remediate any contamination at properties it owns or operates  or as to which it arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances  as such liability is imposed without regard to fault 
failure to replace walmart s case ready business would have a significant adverse effect on national beef s sales and profitability 
sales to walmart represented approximately of national beef s total net sales during its last fiscal year 
national beef has been notified by walmart that it intends to discontinue using national beef as a provider of its case ready products in total case ready revenues were approximately of national beef consolidated revenues during  but as a value added product  case ready products have historically constituted a higher percentage of national beef s gross margin 
since  case ready products have represented from to of national beef s total gross margin  and were at the higher end of that range in due  in part  to reduced gross margin from other national beef products 
national beef is currently pursuing replacement business for its case ready facilities  however  it may not be able to fully replace the operating cash flow generated by these facilities in the near future  if at all 
national beef is subject to extensive governmental regulation and noncompliance with or changes in applicable requirements could adversely affect its business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
national beef s operations are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by the usda  including its fsis and gipsa agencies  the fda  and other federal  state  local and foreign authorities regarding the processing  packaging  storage  safety  distribution  advertising and labeling of its products 
recently  food safety practices and procedures in the meat processing industry have been subject to more intense scrutiny and oversight by the usda 
national beef is also subject to a variety of immigration  labor and worker safety laws and regulations  including those relating to the hiring and retention of employees 
failure to comply with existing or new laws and regulations could result in administrative penalties and injunctive relief  civil remedies  fines  interruption of operations  recalls of products or seizures of properties  potential criminal sanctions and personal injury or other damage claims 
these remedies  changes in the applicable laws and regulations or discovery of currently unknown conditions could increase costs  limit business operations and reduce profitability 
national beef s performance depends on favorable labor relations with its employees  in particular employees represented by collective bargaining agreements 
a substantial number of national beef s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
a labor related work stoppage by unionized employees  or employees who become unionized in the future  could limit national beef s ability to process and ship products or could increase costs 
any significant increase in labor costs  deterioration of employee relations  slowdowns or work stoppages at any of national beef s locations  whether due to union activities  employee turnover or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
declines in the us housing market have reduced revenues and profitability of our manufacturing businesses and may continue to do so 
our manufacturing operations  in particular idaho timber  have generated significant revenues when the us housing market was strong 
the weak us housing market during the last few years has resulted in fewer new housing starts  which has adversely impacted revenues and profitability at idaho timber and conwed plastics 
idaho timber does not expect to return to prior levels of profitability until the us housing market recovers 
the hard rock biloxi is dependent upon patronage of persons living in the gulf coast region 
the hard rock biloxi primarily seeks to attract patrons from its local geographic area 
downturns in local and regional economic conditions  an increase in competition in the surrounding area and interruptions caused by hurricanes could negatively impact operating results 
we may not be able to insure certain risks economically 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to insure all risks that we desire to insure economically or that all of our insurers or reinsurers will be financially viable if we make a claim 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits should occur  or if the company is required to pay a deductible for an insured loss  results of operations could be adversely affected 
premier has been severely damaged by hurricanes in the past  and it is possible that storms could cause significant damage in the future 
damages from storms could result in premier closing its facility to make repairs  resulting in lost business and adversely affecting results of operations 
increases in mortgage interest rate levels  the lack of available consumer credit and the depressed real estate market have reduced and may continue to reduce consumer demand for certain of our real estate development projects and result in impairment charges 
due to current depressed economic conditions in the national real estate market  most of the company s real estate development projects are not being marketed for sale 
if the company begins to market its development projects in the future  the ability to successfully attract customers will be highly dependent upon consumers ability to finance real estate purchases with affordable loans 
if the company is unable to realize its projected cash flows for its development projects  impairment charges are likely 
sangart is subject to extensive government regulation  cannot generate any revenue without regulatory approval of its products and is also subject to all of the risks inherent in establishing a new business 
although funds invested in sangart are generally expensed by sangart when spent  the company cannot be assured that it will ever receive a return on its investment due to the risky nature of sangart s development activities 
clinical trials of sangart s product candidates are not complete  the products have not been approved for sale by regulatory authorities and there is a risk that its products may never prove effective or be approved 
sangart s success depends on its ability to obtain  maintain  renew and defend patent protection for its products and technologies  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 
the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies  such as sangart  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
if sangart s intellectual property positions are challenged  invalidated  circumvented or expire  or if sangart fails to maintain or renew its third party intellectual property licenses in good standing  its ability to successfully bring mp products to market would be adversely affected  it could incur monetary liabilities or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute 
sangart will require significant additional funding for product development and clinical trial activities prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch  the source of such funding has not been identified 
in recent years  substantially all of the funding needed for sangart s development has come from the company 
significant additional funding will be needed prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch  the company is not committed to provide such funding and sangart is currently exploring potential external sources of funding and support 
sangart has had discussions with third party investors  however  no agreements have been reached and if such agreements are entered into it would likely result in significant dilution or outright sale of the company s interest 
if sangart is not provided with additional funds from either the company or other sources when needed  it is unlikely that the company will ever realize any significant return of its invested capital 
the company has incurred costs to investigate and evaluate the development of a number of large scale energy projects  however  development of these projects is subject to obtaining significant third party debt and equity financing  regulatory approvals  the procurement of purchase commitments for long term supplies of feedstock and securing long term commitments from purchasers of the output 
although the company has spent significant amounts investigating large scale energy projects  it will not be able to develop these projects without financing from other sources  various regulatory approvals and commitments from third parties 
the timing of the commencement of construction of any project is also dependent upon the receipt of financing and regulatory approvals 
if the company is unable to obtain such financing  approvals or commitments  or alternatively is unable to monetize a partly or fully permitted project  it will not be able to recover its investment 
if berkadia does not maintain certain specified ratings from the credit rating agencies it could lose its mortgage servicing rights 
berkadia is required to maintain specified servicer ratings from the credit rating agencies  and failure to do so would give its customers the right to terminate their mortgage servicing agreements 
if mortgage servicing agreements were terminated as a result of a servicer ratings downgrade  the company could lose its entire equity investment 
when berkadia originates loans for fannie mae  it is often required to share in the losses on such loans  which could be in excess of reserved amounts 
berkadia carries a reserve on its balance sheet for contingent losses on loans originated for fannie mae that have loss sharing requirements 
if actual losses exceed amounts reserved  berkadia s profitability and cash flows will be reduced 
the loss of or changes in berkadia s relationships with us government sponsored enterprises and federal agencies would have an adverse effect on berkadia s business 
berkadia s failure to comply with the applicable us government sponsored enterprise or agency may result in its termination as an approved seller servicer  mortgagee or issuer 
the loss of any such status could have a significant adverse impact on berkadia s results of operations  could result in a loss of similar approvals from other us government sponsored enterprises or federal agencies and could have other adverse consequences to the business 
fannie mae and freddie mac retain broad discretion to terminate berkadia as a seller servicer without cause upon notice 
changes in existing government sponsored and federal mortgage programs could negatively affect berkadia s business 
berkadia s ability to generate income through mortgage sales to institutional investors depends in part on programs sponsored by fannie mae  freddie mac and the fha  which purchase such loans from berkadia and or facilitate the issuance of mortgage backed securities in the secondary market 
the federal government has announced that the continuation of these programs is under review  and that any or all of the government agency programs could be substantially modified or eliminated in the future 
any discontinuation of  or significant reduction or change in  the operation of those programs would have an adverse effect on berkadia s loan origination and servicing business and results of operations 
berkadia s special servicing and fee for service businesses may be terminated on short notice 
special servicing for each cmbs transaction is usually controlled by the subordinated bond holder class of the securitization 
the owners of the subordinated bonds may change from time to time  and subordinated bond holders may replace berkadia with a different special servicer 
fee for service customers are permitted to terminate berkadia on short notice  usually days 
if berkadia loses special servicing rights or is terminated by fee for service customers  it would negatively impact berkadia s results of operations and cash flows 
cmbs loan and bridge loan programs will expose berkadia to credit and interest rate risk that it is not subject to with its government agency lending programs 
unlike its government agency lending programs  berkadia cannot be assured it will be able to sell cmbs and bridge loans at par value to a third party without any exposure to credit or interest rate risk 
if for any reason berkadia is unable to sell a cmbs loan into the securitization market or if a borrower is unable to refinance a bridge loan  berkadia will retain all risks associated with such loan for as long as it owns the loan 
berkadia may be forced to foreclose on defaulted loans and suffer a loss  or to sell loans to a third party at a discount  either of which would reduce berkadia s profitability and cash flows 
if berkadia suffered significant losses and was unable to repay its commercial paper borrowings  the company would be exposed to loss pursuant to a reimbursement obligation to berkshire hathaway 
berkadia obtains funds generated by commercial paper sales of an affiliate of berkadia 
all of the proceeds from the commercial paper sales are used by berkadia to fund new mortgage loans  servicer advances  investments and other working capital requirements

as of december   the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding was  berkadia s business is significantly affected by general economic conditions  particularly in the commercial real estate industry  and could be harmed in the event of a continued economic slowdown  prolonged recession or other market downturn or disruption 
berkadia s business and earnings are sensitive to changes in government policies and regulations  changes in interest rates  inflation  deflation  oversupply of real estate properties  fluctuations in the real estate and debt capital markets and developments in national and local economies 
unfavorable economic conditions could have an adverse effect on berkadia s business  including decreasing the demand for new loans and the servicing of loans originated by third parties 
the company has a substantial investment in jefferies  an investment banking and securities firm whose operating results are greatly affected by the economy and financial markets 
turmoil in the equity and credit markets had an adverse effect on the volume and size of transactions jefferies executes for its customers  resulting in reduced revenues and profitability in its investment banking  asset management and trading activities  as well as losses in its principal trading activities 
future declines in jefferies operating results caused by these or other conditions could adversely affect the value of the company s investment 
new financial legislation could affect the value of the company s investment in jefferies 
recently adopted legislation in the us will result in more comprehensive regulation of the financial services industry 
such regulation could have an adverse impact on the market value of the company s investment in jefferies 
jefferies is also subject to certain specific risks which could impact the value of the company s investment  these risks are disclosed in jefferies filings with the sec 
the company has a substantial investment in inmet  which is engaged in the mining of base metals principally copper  the prices of which have been volatile and can reduce the value of the company s investment 
the value of the company s investment in inmet rises and falls with the changes in the underlying base metal prices 
in addition  mining operations are often subject to delay and regulatory scrutiny  which can increase costs or delay bringing mines into full production 
pricing changes and mining delays have a direct impact on the value of the company s investment in inmet  and could adversely impact results of operations and equity 
garcadia s business is dependent  in part  upon revenue from new and used car sales at its dealerships  and declines in revenues due to industry or other factors could result in reduced profitability  reduced cash flows and or impairment charges 
garcadia has recorded impairment charges in the past  principally for goodwill and other intangible assets  and if the automobile industry experiences a downturn in the future additional impairment charges are likely 
in addition  reduced revenues would result in reduced profitability and cash flows for the company 
from time to time the company may invest in illiquid securities that are subject to standstill agreements or are otherwise restricted 
from time to time the company may invest in securities that are subject to restrictions which prohibit the company from selling the subject securities for a period of time 
although the company is not a party to any such agreement currently  except for its investment in jefferies  should the company enter into these agreements in the future and need to generate liquidity quickly  such agreements would limit the company s ability to dispose of the underlying investment while the agreement is effective 
the company has significant investments in publicly traded securities and changes in the market prices of these securities  particularly during times of increased volatility in security prices  can have a significant impact on the company s investment portfolio  equity and  for certain investments  on results of operations 
the company has significant investments in publicly traded securities  principally jefferies and inmet  and in jhyh  an operating business that typically owns publicly traded securities 
changes in the market values of publicly traded available for sale securities  such as inmet  are reflected in other comprehensive income loss and equity but not in the consolidated statements of operations 
however  changes in the market value of jefferies  for which the company has elected the fair value option  declines in the fair values of equity securities that the company deems to be other than temporary  and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and equity 
the company s investment in jhyh is accounted for on the equity method of accounting for which the company records its share of jhyh s profits or losses in its consolidated statements of operations 
to the extent that jhyh owns public securities  with changes in market values reflected in its earnings  this increases the company s exposure to volatility in the public securities markets 
global securities markets have been highly volatile  and continued volatility may have a significant negative impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
changes in government tax policies in foreign or domestic jurisdictions where the company has investments could have an adverse impact on the value of those investments 
the company has significant investments in both domestic and foreign businesses  where local and national government tax policies in the jurisdictions where those businesses operate could have an adverse impact on the value of those investments 
government budget deficits may result in legislation to increase or add new taxes on businesses  in particular the domestic financial services and foreign mining sectors 
the company has equity investments and or loans to businesses operating in those sectors  and the announcement of unfavorable taxation policy or regulation for those businesses has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on the values of those investments  and reduce cash flows to the company 
recent economic conditions have adversely affected most of the company s operations and investments 
a worsening of current economic conditions could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by certain of the company s operations and investments  potentially resulting in impairment charges for long lived assets 
certain of the company s operating businesses and investments have significant investments in long lived assets  in particular beef processing  manufacturing and gaming entertainment 
recent economic conditions have resulted in declining revenues for certain of these operations and their property and equipment is not being fully utilized 
as required  the company has reviewed certain of these assets and investments for potential impairment  and except as otherwise disclosed has not concluded that the book values of these long lived assets are not recoverable 
if the operating revenues of these businesses deteriorate in the future  and or the company lowers its estimates of future cash flows  impairment charges might have to be recorded 
we could experience significant increases in operating costs and reduced profitability due to competition for skilled management and staff employees in our operating businesses 
the company competes with many other entities for skilled management and staff employees  including entities that operate in different market sectors than the company 
costs to recruit and retain adequate personnel could adversely affect results of operations 
extreme weather  loss of electrical power or other forces beyond our control could negatively impact our business 
natural disasters  fire  terrorism  pandemic or extreme weather  including droughts  floods  excessive cold or heat  hurricanes or other storms  could interfere with our operating businesses due to power outages  fuel shortages  water shortages  damage to facilities or disruption of transportation channels  among other things 
any of these factors  as well as disruptions to information systems  could have an adverse effect on financial results 
we rely on the security of our information technology systems and those of our third party providers to protect our proprietary information and information of our customers 
some of our businesses involve the storage and transmission of customers personal information  consumer preferences and credit card information 
while we believe that we have implemented protective measures to effectively secure information and prevent security breaches  our information technology systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer hacking  computer viruses or other unauthorized attempts by third parties to access the proprietary information of our customers 
information technology breaches and failures could disrupt our ability to function in the normal course of business resulting in lost revenue  the disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and the incurrence of remediation costs  resulting in legal and financial exposure 
moreover  loss of confidential customer identification information could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under laws that protect confidential personal data  resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues 
from time to time we are subject to litigation  for which we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure and which if adversely determined  may have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the company and its subsidiaries are or may become parties to legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary  routine litigation incidental to their business or not significant to the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity 
although the company s current assessment is that  other than as disclosed in this report  there is no pending litigation that could have a significant adverse impact  if the company s assessment proves to be in error  then the outcome of litigation could have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our deferred tax asset  which would also have to be reduced if us federal income tax rates are lowered 
at december   we have recognized a net deferred tax asset of  if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  we will not be able to fully realize the recorded amount of the net deferred tax asset 
if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of our nols  the nols would expire unused 
the company s projections of future taxable income required to fully realize the recorded amount of the net deferred tax asset reflect numerous assumptions about our operating businesses and investments  and are subject to change as conditions change specific to our business units  investments or general economic conditions 
changes that are adverse to the company could result in the need to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in a charge to results of operations and a decrease to total stockholders equity 
in addition  if us federal income tax rates are lowered  the company would be required to reduce its net deferred tax asset with a corresponding reduction to earnings during the period

the actions also allege that jefferies and leucadia aided and abetted the jefferies directors breach of fiduciary duties

the same day  counsel for the genesee county and gelfand plaintiffs filed a letter with the court withdrawing their motion for expedited discovery 
on february   the court granted provisionally the defendants motion to stay the consolidated delaware action through the expiration of certain proceedings in the new york action 
the defendants intend to vigorously defend both the new york and delaware actions 
as previously reported  the company and certain of its subsidiaries and officers are named as defendants in a consumer class action captioned sykes v 
mel harris associates  llc  et al  civ 
dc  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the sykes action 
the named defendants include the mel harris law firm  certain individuals and members associated with the law firm  and a process server  samserv  inc and certain of its employees 
the action arises out of the law firm s obtaining default judgments against approximately  individuals in new york city civil court with respect to consumer debt purchased by subsidiaries of the company 
the company asserts that it was an investor with respect to the subject purchased consumer debt and was regularly informed of the amounts received from debt collections  but otherwise had no involvement in any alleged illegal debt collection activities 
as also previously reported  the complaint alleges that the defendants fraudulently obtained the default judgments in violation of the fair debt collection practices act  the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act  the new york general business law and the new york judiciary law alleged only as to the law firm and seeks injunctive relief  declaratory relief and damages on behalf of the named plaintiffs and others similarly situated 
defendants motions to dismiss were denied in part including as to the claims made against the company and its subsidiaries and granted in part including as to certain of the claims made against the company s officers the dismissal decision 
in september  the court granted plaintiffs motion to certify the following classes i a class under federal rule of civil procedure b with respect to injunctive and declaratory relief comprised of all persons who have been or will be sued by the mel harris law firm in actions commenced in new york civil court where a default judgment has been or will be sought in connection with this debt collection activity and ii a class under federal rule of civil procedure b with respect to liability comprised of all persons against whom a default judgment has been entered in new york civil court in connection with this debt collection activity the certification decision 
neither the dismissal decision nor the certification decision addresses the ultimate merits of the case 
at a november status conference  the parties advised the court of their intention to attempt to resolve the dispute through mediation 
those efforts have not been successful to date and the parties have so advised the court 
the company intends to seek an appeal of the certification decision to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
because an appeal of the certification decision at this time short of a full judgment on the merits is discretionary  there can be no assurance that the second circuit will agree to hear this appeal 
if the second circuit rejects this appeal  the company will continue to defend the case vigorously on the merits 
determinations of both the probability and the estimated amount of loss or potential loss are judgments made in the context of developments in the litigation 
the company reviews these developments regularly with its outside counsel 
because the company has determined that it would be willing to resolve this matter with plaintiffs for  it has accrued a litigation reserve for this contingency in that amount 
in arriving at this reserve amount  the company considered a number of factors  including that i while the damages sought are indeterminate  payment of this reserved amount would not resolve the case at this time  ii there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending proceedings including motions and appeals respecting class certification  iii there are significant factual issues to be determined or resolved  iv relevant law is unsettled and untested legal theories are presented  v the company has numerous defenses to the plaintiffs claims  vi there are no adverse rulings by the court on the merits of plaintiffs claims and vii several important litigation milestones  such as the completion of discovery and the filing of summary judgment motions  have not yet occurred 
the company also notes that the plaintiffs in the action the class members certified under federal rule of civil procedure b have alleged certain categories of damages under each of the statutes underlying their claims 
these damages include i statutory damages  which are capped under the fair debt collection practices act at  for the class  and ii actual damages 
while not fully described in the complaint  it appears that plaintiffs claim for actual damages includes not only incidental costs incurred in connection with the default judgments including  for example  subway fares to the courthouse and bank fees  costs relating to emotional distress and costs related to reputational damage allegedly arising as a result of the long term effects of the default judgments  but also the full amount of the debt that class members paid whether owed or not following entry of the default judgments 
the amount of debt collected to date totals approximately  if the plaintiffs are successful in proving their claims and in proving actual damages  plaintiffs damages may be subject to prejudgment interest and trebling under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
the company and its subsidiaries are parties to other legal proceedings that are considered to be either ordinary  routine litigation incidental to their business or not significant to the company s consolidated financial position 
the company does not believe that any of these actions will have a significant adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity  but any amounts paid could be significant to results of operations for the period

liquidity and capital resources general the company s investment portfolio  equity and results of operations can be significantly impacted by the changes in market values of certain securities  particularly during times of increased volatility in security prices 
changes in the market values of publicly traded available for sale securities are reflected in other comprehensive income loss and equity 
however  changes in the market prices of investments for which the company has elected the fair value option  declines in the fair values of equity securities that the company deems to be other than temporary  and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and equity 
jhyh also owns public securities with changes in market values reflected in its earnings 
since the company accounts for jhyh on the equity method of accounting  it records its share of jhyh s earnings in the consolidated statement of operations which increases the company s exposure to volatility in the public securities markets 
the company s largest publicly traded available for sale equity security with changes in market values reflected in other comprehensive income loss is inmet

securities classified as current and non current investments are not as liquid as cash and cash equivalents  but they are generally easily convertible into cash within a relatively short period of time 
as of december   the sum of these amounts aggregated  however  since  of this amount is pledged as collateral pursuant to various agreements  is subject to trading restrictions  represents investments in non public securities or is held by subsidiaries that are party to agreements that restrict the company s ability to use the funds for other purposes  the company does not consider those amounts to be available to meet its liquidity needs

the merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting 
the aggregate purchase price will be equal to the sum of the fair value of the company s common shares issued at closing  the fair value of employee stock based awards attributable to periods prior to closing  the fair value of the jefferies common stock owned by the company and the redemption value of the new series of preferred shares issued by the company at closing  which represents its fair value 
the fair values of the jefferies common stock owned by the company and the common shares and employee stock based awards issued by the company will be determined by using market prices at closing 
based on current market prices the aggregate purchase price would be approximately  including the company s investment in jhyh  the aggregate investment in jefferies would be approximately the completion of the merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions  including approval by the company s shareholders by the vote of a majority of the shares cast  assuming a majority of shares outstanding are voted  approval by the jefferies stockholders by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares and the receipt of opinions that the merger will qualify for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the completion of the merger is not conditioned on receipt of financing by the company 
the transaction is expected to close promptly after shareholder approval is received from both companies  shareholder meetings are scheduled to occur on february  jefferies will be the company s largest investment  and will continue to operate as a full service global investment banking firm in its current form 
jefferies will retain a credit rating that is separate from the company s credit rating 
jefferies existing long term debt will remain outstanding and jefferies intends to remain an sec reporting company  regularly filing annual  quarterly  and periodic financial reports 
jefferies has historically reported its balance sheet on an unclassified basis while the company has historically reported a classified balance sheet  with assets and liabilities separated between current and non current 
however  after giving consideration to the nature of jefferies business and the impact the inclusion of its balance sheet will have on the company s consolidated balance sheet  upon completion of the merger the company will report its consolidated balance sheet on an unclassified basis  and the company s consolidated balance sheet captions will be generally based on jefferies captions 
upon consummation of the jefferies merger  jefferies current chief executive officer and current executive committee chairman will become the company s new chief executive officer and new president  respectively 
in connection with presentations made to credit rating agencies with respect to the jefferies merger  jefferies senior management advised the agencies that  after the jefferies merger  the company s management would target specific concentration  leverage and liquidity principles in the future  expressed in the form of certain ratios and percentages  although there is no legal requirement to do so 
these targets and calculations of the company s actual ratios and percentages are detailed below at december  dollars in thousands total equity less  investment in jefferies less  investment in jhyh equity excluding jefferies less  the company s two largest investments national beef inmet  net of tax equity in a stressed scenario balance sheet amounts available liquidity  per above parent company debt see note of notes to consolidated financial statements maximum ratio of parent company debt to stressed equity target

the company will distribute the common shares of crimson to its shareholders on february  the distribution was a condition to the jefferies merger 
as a result  during the first quarter of  the company will record a dividend of approximately  consolidated statements of cash flows as discussed above  the company has historically relied on its available liquidity to meet its short term and long term needs  and to make acquisitions of new businesses and investments 
except as otherwise disclosed herein  the company s operating businesses do not generally require significant funds to support their operating activities  and the company does not depend on positive cash flow from its operating segments to meet its liquidity needs 
the components of the company s operating businesses and investments change frequently as a result of acquisitions or divestitures  the timing of which is impossible to predict but which often have a significant impact on the company s consolidated statements of cash flows in any one period 
further  the timing and amounts of distributions from investments in associated companies may be outside the control of the company 
as a result  reported cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities do not generally follow any particular pattern or trend  and reported results in the most recent period should not be expected to recur in any subsequent period

the securities purchased are generally adjustable rate certificates  secured by seasoned pools of securitized  highly rated residential mortgages  and the certificates acquired generally represent all of the certificates issued by the securitization 
the company s senior note indentures contain covenants that restrict its ability to incur more indebtedness or issue preferred stock of subsidiaries unless  at the time of such incurrence or issuance  the company meets a specified ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth  limit the ability of the company and material subsidiaries to incur  in certain circumstances  liens  limit the ability of material subsidiaries to incur funded debt in certain circumstances  and contain other terms and restrictions all as defined in the senior note indentures 
the company has the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions 
if the company is unable to meet the specified ratio  the company would not be able to issue additional indebtedness or preferred stock  but the company s inability to meet the applicable ratio would not result in a default under its senior note indentures 
the senior note indentures do not restrict the payment of dividends 
certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the company require that collateral be provided to the lender  principally as a result of such requirements  the assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on transfer of funds to the company were  at december  as shown below  at december   the company s contractual cash obligations totaled  payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years indebtedness  including current maturities  and repurchase agreements estimated interest expense on debt cattle commitments planned funding of pension obligations operating leases  net of sublease income asset purchase obligations other total contractual cash obligations the estimated interest expense on debt includes interest related to variable rate debt which the company determined using rates in effect at december  amounts related to the company s pension liability  are included in the table in the less than year period  and the remainder in the years period  however  the exact timing of those cash payments is uncertain 
the above amounts do not include liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of payments  if any  is uncertain 
such amounts aggregated  at december   for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
when the company sold its former telecommunications subsidiary  wiltel communications group  llc wiltel in  wiltel s defined benefit pension plan was not transferred in connection with the sale 
at december   the company had recorded a liability of  on its consolidated balance sheet for wiltel s unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligation 
this amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to former employees of wiltel referred to as the projected benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts 
since the benefits in this plan have been frozen  future changes to the unfunded benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments  changes in the market value of plan assets  differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates 
the company expects to make substantial contributions to the segregated trust account for the wiltel defined benefit pension plan in the future to reduce its plan liabilities although the timing after is uncertain 
the company expects to contribute  to wiltel s defined benefit pension plan in the tax deductibility of contributions is not a primary consideration  principally due to the availability of the company s nols to otherwise reduce taxable income 
as of december   certain amounts for the wiltel plan are as follows dollars in thousands projected benefit obligation funded status balance sheet liability at december  deferred losses included in other comprehensive income loss discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management 
these assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis  including assumptions about discount rates  interest credit rates and expected long term rates of return on plan assets 
the timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market 
this discount rate will be used to determine pension expense in holding all other assumptions constant  a change in this discount rate would affect pension expense by  and the benefit obligation by  the deferred losses included in other comprehensive income loss primarily result from differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions  including changes in discount rates and changes in interest credit rates 
deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year  such amount aggregated  at december  a portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during based on an amortization period of twelve years 
the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the plan  which are more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit 
pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the company sold cds holding corporation cds to homefed in  the company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the san elijo hills project 
these bonds  which are for the benefit of the city of san marcos  california and other government agencies  are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project 
cds is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds 
should the city or others draw on the bonds for any reason  cds and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the company for the amount drawn 
at december   the amount of outstanding bonds was  almost all of which expires in subsidiaries of the company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating  at december   principally to secure various obligations 
the majority of these letters of credit expire during and the remainder expire no later than during  a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway provided berkadia with a five year  billion secured credit facility  which was used to fund outstanding mortgage loans and servicer advances  purchase mortgage servicing rights and for working capital needs 
in  berkadia fully repaid the amount outstanding under its secured credit facility with funds generated by commercial paper sales of an affiliate of berkadia 
effective as of december   the secured credit facility was terminated 
all of the proceeds from the commercial paper sales are used by berkadia to fund new mortgage loans  servicer advances  investments and other working capital requirements 
repayment of the commercial paper is supported by a  surety policy issued by a berkshire hathaway insurance subsidiary and corporate guaranty  and the company has agreed to reimburse berkshire hathaway for one half of any losses incurred 
as of december   the aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding was  critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions 
the following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a significant impact on the company financial statements  and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect  at a specific point in time  events whose ultimate outcome won t be known until a later date 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax asset to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if in the future the company determines that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize its net deferred tax asset in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax asset would increase income in such period 
if in the future the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its recorded net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in such period 
the company is required to consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  and to weight the evidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required and the amount of such valuation allowance 
generally  greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this assessment  in particular on recent historical operating results 
during  the company realized significant gains from the sale of certain investments  recorded significant unrealized gains in the fair values of other investments and began to experience modest improvement in the operating results in some business segments 
additionally  the company s cumulative taxable income for recent years became a positive amount  reflecting the realized gains on the sales of acf and las cruces during the fourth quarter of with this recent positive evidence the company gave greater weight to its revised projections of future taxable income  which consider significant unrealized gains in its investment portfolio  and to its long term historical ability to generate significant amounts of taxable income when assessing the amount of its required valuation allowance 
as a result  the company was able to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will have future taxable income sufficient to realize a significant portion of the company s net deferred tax asset  accordingly   of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense on december  in addition to its projections of future taxable income  the company is relying upon the sale of investments that have unrealized gains before the nols expire and the corresponding reversal of related deferred tax liabilities to realize a portion of its net deferred tax asset 
the company s estimate of future taxable income considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  about its operating businesses and investments  included an aggregation of individual projections for each significant operating business and investment  estimated apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and included all future years that the company estimated it would have available nols until 
the company believes that its estimate of future taxable income is reasonable but inherently uncertain  and if its current or future operations and investments generate taxable income different than the projected amounts  further adjustments to the valuation allowance are possible 
in addition to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities related to unrealized gains  the company will need to generate approximately  of future us pre tax income to fully realize its net deferred tax asset 
the current balance of the deferred tax valuation allowance principally reserves for nols of certain subsidiaries that are not available to offset income generated by other members of the company s consolidated tax return group 
the company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the company s assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when testing for impairment  the company groups its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities or asset group 
the determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value 
one of the company s real estate subsidiaries mb had been the owner and developer of a mixed use real estate project located in myrtle beach  south carolina 
the project was comprised of a retail center with approximately  square feet of retail space   square feet of office space and residential apartment rental units 
the acquisition and construction costs were funded by capital contributed by the company and nonrecourse indebtedness that was collateralized by the real estate 
mb s indebtedness matured during  but it was not repaid since mb did not have sufficient funds and the company was under no obligation to provide the funds to mb to pay off the loan 
the company recorded an impairment charge of  during during the second quarter of  mb entered into an agreement with its lenders under which  among other things  mb agreed not to interfere with or oppose foreclosure proceedings and the lenders agreed to release mb and various guarantors of the loan 
a receiver was put in place at the property  foreclosure proceedings commenced and an auction of the property was conducted  however  the company was informed during the fourth quarter of that the highest bidder for the property failed to close 
in december  the company was invited to make a bid for the property  with the condition that a foreclosure sale to the company must close as soon as possible without any due diligence period  which new bidders for the property would require 
a subsidiary of the company offered  for the property including net working capital amounts  the offer was accepted and the foreclosure sale closed on january  as a result of the failure of the initial buyer to purchase the property and the subsequent sale to the company in  the company concluded that the carrying value of the property was further impaired at december   accordingly  the company recorded an additional impairment charge in of  to reflect the property at its fair value of  at closing in  mb was released from any remaining liability under the bank loan  outstanding at december   accordingly  the remaining balance due after payment of the purchase price  was recognized in other income in the company recorded impairment charges in selling  general and other expenses for various other real estate projects of  in and  in  and  in in the corporate segment for one of its corporate aircraft that was later sold 
recent economic conditions have adversely affected most of the company s operations and investments 
a worsening of current economic conditions could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the company s operations and investments 
if future undiscounted cash flows are estimated to be less than the carrying amounts of the asset groups used to generate those cash flows in subsequent reporting periods  particularly for those with large investments in intangible assets and property and equipment for example  beef processing  manufacturing  gaming entertainment  real estate and certain associated company investments  impairment charges would have to be recorded 
impairment of equity method investments the company evaluates equity method investments for impairment when operating losses or other factors may indicate a decrease in value which is other than temporary 
for investments in investment partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method  the company obtains from the investment partnership financial statements  net asset values and other information on a quarterly basis and annual audited financial statements 
on a quarterly basis  the company also makes inquiries and discusses with investment managers whether there were significant procedural  valuation  composition and other changes at the investee 
since these investment partnerships record their underlying investments at fair value  after application of the equity method the carrying value of the company s investment is equal to its share of the investees underlying net assets at their fair values 
absent any unusual circumstances or restrictions concerning these investments  which would be separately evaluated  it is unlikely that any additional impairment charge would be required 
for equity method investments in operating businesses  the company considers a variety of factors including economic conditions nationally and in their geographic areas of operation  adverse changes in the industry in which they operate  declines in business prospects  deterioration in earnings  increasing costs of operations and other relevant factors specific to the investee 
whenever the company believes conditions or events indicate that one of these investments might be significantly impaired  the company will obtain from such investee updated cash flow projections and impairment analyses of the investee assets 
the company will use this information and  together with discussions with the investee s management  evaluate if the book value of its investment exceeds its fair value  and if so and the situation is deemed other than temporary  record an impairment charge 
impairment of securities declines in the fair value of equity securities considered to be other than temporary and declines in the fair values of debt securities related to credit losses are reflected in net securities gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the company s determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information  gaap requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment  rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria 
the various factors that the company considers in making its determination are specific to each investment 
for publicly traded debt and equity securities  the company considers a number of factors including  but not limited to  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the reason for the decline in fair value  changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  the ability and intent to hold investments to maturity  and other factors specific to the individual investment 
for investments in private equity funds and non public securities  the company bases its determination upon financial statements  net asset values and or other information obtained from fund managers or investee companies 
the company recorded impairment charges for securities in the consolidated statement of operations of   and  for  and  respectively 
the company s assessment involves a high degree of judgment and accordingly  actual results may differ significantly from the company s estimates and judgments 
business combinations at acquisition  the company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values 
significant judgments and estimates are often made by the company s management to determine these values  and may include the use of appraisals  consideration of market quotes for similar transactions  use of discounted cash flow techniques or consideration of other information the company believes to be relevant 
the finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete  and if final values are significantly different from initially recorded amounts adjustments to prior periods may be required 
any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill  which is not amortized to expense 
if the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired are greater than the purchase price  the excess is treated as a bargain purchase and recognized in income 
recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value 
at december   the book value of goodwill was  and was not impaired 
subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
once final  the company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price  even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the company s original judgments and estimates to be inaccurate 
in addition  long lived assets recorded in a business combination like property and equipment  intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the assumptions and judgments made by the company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future 
in december  the company acquired of national beef and it became a consolidated subsidiary of the company 
the allocation of the purchase price included  to property  equipment and leasehold improvements   to amortizable intangible assets   to goodwill   to net working capital accounts   to long term debt and  to redeemable non controlling interests 
to assist the company s management in its determination of the fair value of national beef s property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and equity value  the company engaged an independent valuation and appraisal firm 
the methods used by the company s management to determine the fair values included estimating national beef s business enterprise value through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis 
property and equipment asset valuations included an analysis of depreciated replacement cost and current market prices 
the company considered several factors to determine the fair value of property and equipment  including local market conditions  recent market transactions  the size  age  condition  utility and character of the property  the estimated cost to acquire replacement property  an estimate of depreciation from use and functional obsolescence and the remaining expected useful life of the assets 
amounts allocated to product inventories were principally based on quoted commodity prices on the acquisition date 
for other components of working capital  the historical carrying values approximated fair values 
national beef s long term debt principally consists of its senior credit facility payable to its bank group  which was renegotiated in june in december  the lenders consented to the acquisition as required by the credit facility  and to certain other amendments to the facility s covenants  the pricing of the credit facility remained the same 
in addition to these factors  the company also analyzed changes in market interest rates from june and concluded that the principal amount due under the credit facility approximated its fair value on the acquisition date 
the fair value of certain pre existing redeemable noncontrolling interests was the amount paid to redeem such interests immediately after the company s acquisition of its controlling interest in national beef 
the fair value of other redeemable noncontrolling interests was determined based upon the purchase price paid by the company for its interest 
use of fair value estimates under gaap  fair value is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price  and may be based on observable or unobservable inputs 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources 
unobservable inputs reflect assumptions made by the company that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
gaap also establishes a hierarchy to prioritize and categorize fair value measurements based on the transparency of inputs as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
the nature of these financial instruments include cash instruments for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently  derivative instruments whose fair value have been derived using a model where inputs to the model are directly observable in the market  or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  and instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments  the parameters of which can be directly observed 
level instruments that have little to no pricing observability as of the reporting date 
these financial instruments are measured using management s best estimate of fair value  where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation 
substantially all of the company s investment portfolio is classified as available for sale securities  which are carried at estimated fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the estimated fair values are principally based on publicly quoted market prices level inputs  which can rise or fall in reaction to a wide variety of factors or events  and as such are subject to market related risks and uncertainties 
the company has a segregated portfolio of mortgage pass through certificates issued by us government sponsored enterprises fhlmc or fnma and by us government agencies gnma  which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of  at december  although the markets that these types of securities trade in are generally active  market prices are not always available for the identical security 
the fair value of these investments are based on observable market data including benchmark yields  reported trades  issuer spreads  benchmark securities  bids and offers 
these estimates of fair value are considered to be level inputs  and the amounts realized from the disposition of these investments has not been significantly different from their estimated fair values 
the company also has a segregated portfolio of non agency mortgage backed securities which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of  at december  although these securities trade in brokered markets  the market for these securities is sometimes inactive 
the fair values of these investments are based on bid and ask prices  quotes obtained from independent market makers and pricing services 
these estimates of fair values are also considered to be level inputs 
contingencies the company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management  can be highly subjective and are subject to significant change with the passage of time as more information becomes available 
estimating the ultimate impact of litigation matters is inherently uncertain  in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within the power of the company to control 
the company does not believe that any of its current litigation will have a significant adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  however  if amounts paid at the resolution of litigation are in excess of recorded reserve amounts  the excess could be significant in relation to results of operations for that period 
during  the company accrued  for losses it estimates are probable in connection with the sykes action discussed above 
the company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of its accrual as the case develops and more information becomes available 
the recognition of increases to its estimated loss in future periods is possible 
results of operations substantially all of the company s operating businesses sell products or services that are impacted by general economic conditions in the us and to a lesser extent internationally 
poor general economic conditions have reduced the demand for products or services sold by the company s operating subsidiaries and or resulted in reduced pricing for products or services

because national beef operates in a large and liquid commodity market  it does not have much influence over the price it pays for cattle or the selling price it receives for the products it produces 
national beef s profitability typically fluctuates seasonally as well as cyclically  with relatively higher margins in the spring and summer months and during times of cattle herd expansion 
the usda regularly reports market values for cattle  beef  offal and other products produced by ranchers  farmers and beef processors 
generally  national beef expects its profitability to improve as the ratio of the usda comprehensive boxed beef cutout a weekly reported measure of the total value of all usda inspected beef primal cuts  grind and trim produced from fed cattle to the usda area weekly average slaughter cattle price increases and for profitability to decline as the ratio decreases 
the ratio during was the lowest ratio for the corresponding periods during the past ten years

national beef s profitability is primarily dependent upon the spread between what it pays for fed cattle and the price it receives for its products  along with the efficiency of its processing facilities 
the drought contributed to a decline in the beef cow herd and affected the supply of fed cattle  this caused the price national beef pays for fed cattle to increase more than it can pass along in the form of higher selling prices for its products  resulting in reduced profitability

since  case ready products have represented from to of national beef s total gross margin  and are at the higher end of that range in due  in part  to reduced gross margin from other national beef products 
during the first quarter of  the two case ready facilities will begin to operate at reduced levels  resulting in an approximate reduction in the number of personal employed at the facilities 
in connection with the reduction in the labor force  national beef will record a charge estimated to be approximately  during the first quarter of national beef is currently pursuing replacement business for its case ready facilities  however  it may not be able to fully replace the operating cash flow generated by these facilities in the near future  if at all 
the company has evaluated national beef s tangible and intangible assets for impairment and has concluded that they are not impaired  its evaluation included an estimate of expected future cash flows to be generated by the case ready facilities from prospective customers who have not  as yet  committed to purchase case ready products from national beef 
if national beef is unsuccessful in securing any new case ready business  the company does not believe it will need to record any impairment to its intangible assets or goodwill 
however  if national beef concludes its best course of action is to close one or both case ready facilities  impairment charges may be recorded if the fair value of those facilities on a held for sale basis is less than the book value
