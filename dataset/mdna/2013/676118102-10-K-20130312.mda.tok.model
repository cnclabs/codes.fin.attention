the increase in artifact and other sales of million in was primarily due to an increase in other revenue of million associated with revenue from the gairsoppa project million of which was in the fourth quarter offset by a reduction in artifact sales of 
million 
of the revenue recognized from the gairsoppa project  million was related to silver sales and million was credited to revenue from deferred income that represented revenue participation rights earned from the galt resources investment 
the decrease in expedition charter revenue in of million was associated with our subsea mineral mining charters primarily related to neptune minerals and other miscellaneous charters million  a reduction of robert fraser shipwreck projects million offset in part by work performed in on chatham rock phosphates million

cost and expenses cost of sales consists of shipwreck recovery costs  grading  conservation  packaging  and shipping costs associated with artifact and merchandise sales 
cost of sales decreased by 
million in versus due to fewer silver coins sold in versus operations and research expenses primarily include all costs within archaeology  conservation  research  and marine operations  which include all vessel and charter operations

million and other interest 
million 
of the total interest expense of million  only million represented cash payments for interest and financing costs 
income taxes we did not record any provision benefit for income taxes in or due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets resulting from operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a full valuation allowance of million against the deferred tax assets as of december   compared to million as of december  as required by the accounting for income taxes topic in the accounting standards codification asc  we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on the available evidence  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would not be realizable without the recovery of high value shipwrecks and thus a valuation allowance has been recorded as of december  we anticipate that we may continue to incur net losses in pending any shipwreck cargo recoveries that could be quickly monetized ie  gairsoppa or victory projects 
we will continue to reassess the need for a valuation allowance during each future reporting period

at december   chatham anticipated a financing to pay for the charter 
we did not record the revenue from this charter because of their liquidity and capital positions at that time

bank term and mortgage loan on march   we amended our million term loan maturing on april  the term loan was increased to million with an expiration date of july  the facility bears floating interest at the one month libor rate according to the wall street journal plus basis points 
any prepayments made in full or in part are without premium or penalty 
a commitment renewal fee of  was payable at closing 
no restricted cash payments will need to be kept on deposit 
the term loan is still secured by approximately  numismatic coins recovered by the company from the ss republic shipwreck  which amount will be reduced over the term by the amount of coins sold by the company 
the coins used as collateral are held by a custodian for the security of the bank 
the borrowing base is equal to forty percent of the eligible coin inventory valued on a rolling twelve month wholesale average value 
the company is required to comply with a number of customary covenants 
we have had preliminary discussions with fifth third bank and expect the term and mortgage loans  which expire on july  to be renewed 
on july   odyssey marine exploration  inc entered into a project term loan agreement with fifth third bank that provided a credit facility of up to million 
the term loan bears interest at a floating rate equal to the one month libor rate plus basis points 
an origination fee of  was payable at closing 
a restricted cash deposit of  was required to cover interest payments when the term loan is advanced 
the term loan was secured by approximately million worth of silver recovered from the ss gairsoppa 
the proceeds of the credit facility were used to fund the project recovery costs 
the company took a million draw against the facility on july  we paid the project term loan in october with proceeds from the gairsoppa project 
trends and uncertainties our current business plan estimates positive cash flow from operating activities 
the plan contains assumptions which include that several of our planned projects are funded through project recoveries gairsoppa and other financings  syndications or other partnership opportunities 
the business plan expenses include a day charter agreement which we recently executed with a company to provide a ship and equipment to conduct recovery operations on the gairsoppa and mantola projects similar to the work performed in where we monetized over million of silver cash proceeds 
one or more of these projected project recoveries  financing or partnership opportunities may not be realized which may require the need for additional cash 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our cash position will be sufficient to fund operating cash flows throughout the rest of taking into account our beginning cash balance  current cash flow expectations and revenues from multiple sources  including projected sales from recoveries  syndicated projects and other potential financing opportunities 
we also anticipate renewing our term and mortgage loans with fifth third bank in july we have experienced several years of net losses resulting in a stockholders deficit 
our capacity to generate net income in future periods is dependent upon our success in recovering and monetizing shipwrecks  realizing capital gains from sale of interest in mineral exploration entities  generating income from shipwreck or mineral exploration charters or to generate income from other projects 
however  it is likely that we could monetize a significant portion of the gairsoppa and mantola projects in which could fund our operations for future periods 
if cash flow is not sufficient to meet our projected business plan requirements  we will be required to raise additional capital or curtail expenses 
while we have been successful in raising the necessary funds in the past  there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so in compared to vs

odyssey s shipwreck pirates treasure is an interactive multi media exhibit and features over artifacts recovered from our deep ocean shipwreck expeditions 
the increase of

the ocean alert was favorable 
million which is net of the 
million loss on the disposal of the asset since it was not working in and was sold in september

off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  we do not have any interest in so called limited purpose entities  which include special purpose entities spes and structured finance entities 
indemnification provisions under our bylaws and certain consulting agreements  we have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors for certain events arising as a result of the officer s or director s serving in such capacity 
separate agreements may provide indemnification after term of service 
the term of the indemnification agreement is as long as the officer or director remains in the employment of the company 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  our director and officer liability insurance policy limits its exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of our insurance policy coverage  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and no liabilities are recorded for these agreements as of december  critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 
long lived assets as of december   we had approximately million of property and equipment and related assets 
our policy is to recognize impairment losses relating to long lived assets in accordance with the asc topic for property  plant and equipment 
impairment decisions are based on several factors  including  but not limited to  management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
realizability of deferred tax assets we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of at december  as required by the accounting for income taxes topic in the asc  we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on the available evidence  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would not be realizable without the recovery and rights of ownership or salvage rights of high value shipwrecks and thus a valuation allowance of million has been recorded as of december  artifact inventory the value of recovered artifacts in inventory includes the costs of recovery and conservation 
the capitalized costs include direct costs of recovery such as vessel and related equipment operations and maintenance  crew and technical labor  fuel  provisions  supplies  port fees  depreciation and may even include fees paid to an insurer to relinquish the insurer s claim to the recovered artifacts 
conservation costs include fees paid to conservators for cleaning and preserving the artifacts 
we continually monitor the recorded aggregate costs of the artifacts in inventory to ensure these costs do not exceed the net realizable value 
we use historical sales  publications or available public market data to assess market value 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining the collectability of our accounts receivable  we need to make certain assumptions and estimates 
specifically  we may examine accounts and assess the likelihood of collection of particular accounts
