we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties  discussed in the section entitled risk factors  in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  and the note regarding forward looking statements  included at the beginning of this annual report on form k 
such risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecasted in forward looking statements or implied in historical results and trends 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we believe that based on market share and the number of campuses employing our products  we are a leading provider of technology and payment services to the higher education industry 
we believe that none of our competitors match our ability to provide solutions for higher education institutions financial services needs  including compliance monitoring  and  consequently  that we provide the most comprehensive suite of disbursement  data analytics and payment solutions specifically designed for higher education institutions and their students 
we also provide campus communities with convenient  cost competitive and student oriented banking services  which include extensive user friendly features 
our products and services for our higher education institution clients include our onedisburse refund management disbursement service and our suite of payment transaction products and services 
through our current bank partners  we offer our oneaccount service to the students of our higher education institution clients  which includes an fdic insured deposit account  a debit mastercard atm card and other retail banking services 
as of december   more than campuses serving more than million students had purchased the onedisburse service and campuses serving more than million students had contracted to use at least one of our onedisburse  cashnet or campus labs products and services 
we also had approximately million oneaccounts as of december  for the year ended december  total revenue was approximately million  representing three year compounded annual growth of approximately  net income was approximately million  representing three year compounded annual growth of approximately  adjusted ebitda was approximately million  representing three year compounded annual growth of approximately  and adjusted net income was approximately million  representing three year compounded annual growth of approximately 
see supplemental non gaap financial and operating information below for definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income each of which are non gaap measures and reconciliations to net income 
in addition  as of december   the number of oneaccounts had increased by a compounded annual growth rate of compared to december  we expect our growth to continue in the future and that our strategy will continue to offer significant opportunity for expansion 
key elements of our growth strategy include expanding the number of contracted higher education institutions  increasing oneaccount adoption and usage rates  cross selling our products to existing clients to increase the number of institutions using each product  enhancing our products and services to create new sources of revenue  and pursuing strategic partnerships and opportunistic acquisitions 
in evaluating our results  we consider a variety of operating and financial measures 
the key metrics that we use to determine how our business is performing include i total number of students enrolled at our higher education institution clients  ii number of oneaccounts  iii total revenue  iv adjusted ebitda  v adjusted net income  and vi net income 
see supplemental non gaap financial and operating information below for definitions of ebitda and adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income each of which are non gaap measures and reconciliations to net income 
our primary source of revenue is generated from the use of oneaccounts 
the primary factor affecting our revenue is the number of active oneaccounts  which  in turn  is significantly affected by the total number of students enrolled at the higher education institution clients utilizing our onedisburse service 
revenue we derive revenue primarily from fees charged for the transactions that we facilitate for our higher education institution clients and our banking customers 
most of these fees are charged on a per transaction basis and  accordingly  transaction volumes significantly affect our revenue growth 
transaction volumes are generally a function of the number of students enrolled at each of our higher education institution clients  as a larger student population will generally lead to a greater number of active oneaccounts and related banking transactions  as well as other transactions such as onedisburse based disbursements and payment transactions 
we negotiate our fee rates with our higher education institution clients 
fees charged to our banking and payment transaction customers are generally set by a schedule and apply unilaterally to all customers 
fees charged for oneaccount services are collected by our bank partners as incurred and subsequently remitted to us 
fees charged on payment transactions are charged as incurred and retained by us  while fees charged in respect of our onedisburse product  cashnet suite of payment products and campus labs suite of data analytics software are billed to our higher education institution clients and subsequently collected from them 

table of contents we have a retention rate of our higher education institution clients that has been in excess of for each of the past years which helps to ensure a stable and recurring client base 
we believe that our recurring client base provides us with a revenue stream from our higher education institution clients that is relatively stable  recurring and predictable 
the majority of our revenue each year from higher education institution clients is generated through relationships and contracts that were signed in prior year 
our account revenue and payment transaction revenues are also based on recurring relationships with our higher education institutions  however  since the revenue is largely earned from transaction activity of current students  the predictability of those revenue streams can vary due to changes in enrollment at our higher education institution clients and the percentage of students at those higher education institution clients that use our services 
changes in either enrollment or student usage can have an impact on our revenues and profitability and impact the predictability of our results 
we divide our revenue into four categories account revenue  payment transaction revenue  higher education institution revenue and other revenue 
during we initiated a plan which provided credits to certain current and former customers that were previously assessed certain non sufficient fund fees and which resulted in a reduction to revenues in the year 
account revenue we generate revenue from active oneaccounts  which are opened and funded by students and other members of the campus community 
we earn revenue based on both interchange fees and account service fees 
account service fees include  for example  foreign atm fees and non sufficient fund fees 
these fees are either charged by our bank partners and remitted to us or we charge them to our customers directly 
in december  august and december  we began to offer new versions of the oneaccount  each of which has different fee schedules compared to the original oneaccount 
our bank partners charge merchants interchange fees for point of sale  or pos  purchases made with debit mastercard atm cards and remit these fees to us 
the amount of the fee generally depends on the size of the transaction  the merchant where the purchase is made and the network through which the transaction is processed 
we earn atm fees from transactions conducted through our atms with cards other than the debit mastercard atm cards our bank partners issue 
we also earn fees from atm transactions conducted by oneaccount holders using their debit mastercard atm cards at atms outside of our atm network 
we earn other fees for banking services provided to oneaccount holders  including fees for conducting wire transfers  replacing lost debit mastercard atm card  processing international transactions  processing stop payment requests  over the counter cash withdrawals using debit mastercard atm cards  issuing official checks and electronic bill pay features 
our bank partners charge non sufficient funds fees and remits them to us when oneaccount holders attempt to withdraw or transfer money from their oneaccounts in excess of their deposited funds 
these non sufficient funds fees are primarily assessed on electronic transfers from  and checks drawn on  accounts in excess of available funds 
prior to the third quarter of  our bank partners also assessed these fees on overdrafts on debit card transactions 
however  the federal reserve board amended regulation e to limit the ability of financial institutions  effective july   to assess an overdraft fee for paying atm and one time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer account  unless the consumer affirmatively consents  or opts in  to the institution payment of overdrafts for these services 
we have not offered the opt in feature to our customers for atm or one time debit card transactions 
in the absence of debit card related non sufficient funds fees  our total non sufficient funds fees per oneaccount that our bank partners remit to us began to decrease during and continued to decrease on a comparative basis through while our historical experience has been that account revenue generated per oneaccount has been generally stable year over year  with total account revenue generally increasing proportionally with increases in the number of oneaccounts  the implementation of regulation e in the third quarter of along with other changes that we made to our account fee schedule in  decreased the revenue per oneaccount in compared to the same period in this trend continued through the remainder of and through notwithstanding the decrease in non sufficient fund fees  the primary influence on account revenue growth is expected to continue to be the number of active oneaccounts and the amount of refunds disbursed by our higher education institution clients 
during  we also increased our marketing efforts with the goal of increasing primary account usage of the oneaccount by our customers  which we also expect to contribute to future revenue growth 
during the fall semester of  the amount of disbursements which we delivered to individuals that had selected the oneaccount as their preferred method of receiving a refund from their higher education institution was slightly lower than it was compared to prior year 
this was in part due to a decline in the average size and unique number of individuals for which we processed a disbursement for higher education institution that were onedisburse clients both last year and the current year 
in addition  during the year ended december   the ratio of individuals selecting to receive a disbursement for their higher education institution to a oneaccount was lower than the prior year 
growth in the number of oneaccounts is tied to growth in the number of students enrolled at our onedisburse higher education institution clients  which expands as new clients contract to use this product as well as the number of students that choose the oneaccount as their preferred method of receiving a refund 
we believe the rate of oneaccount adoption varies  however  based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the average tenure of a student at a higher education institution  whether the higher education institution is a year or a year school or a public or private school and the mix of undergraduate and graduate students 
the number of oneaccounts has risen in each of the last three years  which has led to a compounded annual growth rate of in account revenue over this period 
the number of oneaccounts was essentially flat between and both as a result of the factors described in the paragraph above as well as a change we made during to close out low balance  inactive accounts 
payment transaction revenue we generate payment transaction revenue through convenience fees charged to students  parents or other payers who establish payment plans to make tuition payments or to those who make online payments to our higher education institution clients through the smartpay feature of our epayment product using a credit or debit card 
as this fee is assessed on a per transaction basis  growth in payment transaction revenue is primarily influenced by transaction volumes 
we acquired our epayment product when we purchased idc in november higher education institution revenue our higher education institution clients pay fees for the products and services they purchase from us 
we charge our clients i an annual subscription fee based on the size of their student population  ii a per transaction fee  or iii a combination of both 
for certain payment transaction products  we also charge an implementation fee  which is deferred and recognized over the estimated client relationship period  which we currently estimate to be five years 
the composition of our higher education institution revenue changed substantially with our acquisition of idc in november  with a large proportion of this revenue stream now being derived from our payment products related revenue 
prior to the acquisition of idc  our revenue from higher education institutions had been primarily comprised of carding and transaction fees related to our onedisburse product 
the composition was further changed with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of campus labs in august all of the revenue generated from the campus labs products is included within higher education institution revenue 

table of contents the number of students enrolled at client institutions and the number of campuses under contract are significant drivers of our higher education institution revenue 
the number of client institutions increased significantly during as a result of our campus labs acquisition 
we expect that future increases in our institution client base  as well as additional sales to our existing client base  will result in increases in our higher education institution revenue 
other revenue other revenue consists of two main components a marketing incentive fee paid by mastercard international incorporated based on new debit mastercard atm card issuances  and processing fees paid by our bank partners based on the total amount of deposits held in our oneaccounts and prevailing interest rates 
as a result of a change in our arrangement with mastercard  which took effect in the fourth quarter of  the amount of revenue received from mastercard which is recorded in other revenue will be much smaller in future periods 
because the amount of the processing fee is in part a function of prevailing interest rates  this revenue stream has historically fluctuated in accordance with interest rate movements 
since  fees paid by our bank partners have been relatively small due to low interest rates 
if prevailing interest rates rise  our processing fee will also increase 
currently  this revenue stream is immaterial to our overall results of operations 
customer credit plan in december  we voluntarily initiated a plan which provided credits to certain current and former customers that were previously assessed certain insufficient fund fees 
as a result of this plan  we recorded a reduction in our revenue of approximately million in the insufficient funds fees that are credited to customers under this plan were originally assessed beginning in cost and expenses employee compensation and related expenses represent our largest single expense 
we allocate compensation and other related expenses  including stock based compensation  to cost of revenue  product development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
while we expect the number of our employees to increase over time  we believe that economies of scale in our business model will allow us to increase our compensation and related expenses at a lower rate than revenue 
other costs and expenses include outsourced managed hosting  data processing  atm related expenses  professional services  office lease payments  travel and amortization 
the following summarizes our cost of revenue and certain significant operating expenses cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of data processing expenses  interchange expenses related to smartpay and atm transactions  customer service expenses  amortization of implementation fees and uncollectible fees and write offs 
these expenses are shared across our different revenue categories and we are not able to meaningfully allocate such costs between separate categories of revenue 
consequently  all costs and expenses applicable to our revenue are included in the cost of revenue category in our statements of operations 
these expenses generally move in line with the transaction volumes for our banking and payment transactions services 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses include finance  legal  compliance  facility and administration costs  as well as components of operational costs such as atm cash services and maintenance  data center costs and costs associated with our information technology 
these costs include employee compensation and related expenses  as well as fees for professional services 
as a newly public company  we started to incur additional general and administrative expenses in and throughout and as a result of our need to comply with the ongoing legal and regulatory requirements associated with being a public company  including the sec reporting obligations  director and officer liability insurance and other expenses 
product development product development expenses include costs associated with defining and specifying new features and ongoing enhancements for our proprietary technology platforms and other aspects of our service offerings 
product development costs primarily relate to employee compensation 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include costs of acquiring new institution clients and educating their students about our services in order to improve the adoption and usage rates of our oneaccount and our other student oriented products and services 
sales and marketing costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation 
each of our sales representatives earns i a base salary  ii sales commissions  which are earned upon the signing of a contract with a higher education institution client  and iii generally  certain trailing commissions  which are based on account performance 
through the year ended december   the majority of our sales and marketing expenses were comprised of stock based customer acquisition expense recorded in connection with our acquisition of educard in and pursuant to a related intellectual property purchase agreement 
the amount of stock based customer acquisition expense depended on the number of shares released from escrow and the value of the shares at that time 
we also recorded cash based customer acquisition expense in connection with our acquisition of idc in november of both of the agreements related to our stock based and cash based customer acquisition expense expired at the end of  and we have not incurred expenses since then related to these agreements 
campus labs acquisition in august  we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of campus labs  llc  a leader in providing data analytic solutions to higher education institutions 
this transaction provided us with our suite of data analytic products and services and nearly doubled the number of campuses with which we had relationships 
we purchased campus labs for million in cash  warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock and a potential earn out payment based on revenues of the acquired business 
in acquiring campus labs  we purchased its data analytics suite of products and services  such as compliance assist  course evaluation  collegiate link  baseline and beacon  which we did not previously offer 
see also part i  item business products and services campus labs data analytics suite of this annual report on form k 

table of contents merger and acquisition related costs include professional fees associated with the acquisition and related audit of  a fair value adjustment to the contingent consideration component of the purchase price and certain employee related costs related to a bonus to be paid to employees previously employed by camps labs following a specified time period of employment by higher one 
we will continue to record fair value adjustments to the contingent consideration liability as necessary until the payment of all amounts due under the agreement 
the employee related costs will continue to generate expense through the six month anniversary of the acquisition date 
critical accounting policies a number of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by our management  and such judgments are reflected in the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in applying these policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  management observation of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
actual results may differ significantly from the estimates contained in our consolidated financial statements 
the following areas represent our critical accounting policies provision for operational losses stock based compensation goodwill and intangible assets income taxes business combinations information about these critical accounting policies is included in note significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in the annual report on form k and to the extent additional information is relevant  it has been included below 
provision for operational losses our reserve is established based upon an analysis of outstanding overdrafts and historical repayment rates 
if the financial condition of our accountholders were to deteriorate  thereby reducing their ability to make payments  or if they otherwise fail to repay the amounts owed to us  additional reserves would be required in the future 
goodwill and intangible assets we have one operating segment and reporting unit for purposes of our goodwill testing as a result of the integrated way that the entire business is managed 
as of the completion of our impairment test on october   our reporting unit was not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test 
we performed the annual impairment test during with a qualitative assessment and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was not less than its carrying value 
we performed the annual impairment test as of october  and determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of potential impairment  we assess whether an impairment has occurred based on whether net book value of the assets exceeds related projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets 
we consider a number of factors  including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends and product development cycles in estimating future cash flows 
differing estimates and assumptions as to any of the factors described above could result in a materially different impairment charge and thus materially different results of operations 
stock based compensation the options we grant expire ten years from the date of grant 
options for our employees vest over periods ranging from one month to five years  with the majority vesting as follows one fifth of the granted options vest one year from the date of grant  the remaining four fifths vest at a rate of per month over the remaining four years of the vesting period 
the board grants primarily incentive stock options  but occasionally grants nonqualified stock options to key members of management 
the amount of stock based compensation expense we recognize during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate option forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
restricted stock is a stock award that entitles the holder to receive shares of our common stock as the award vests over time 
the board granted restricted stock awards in when it granted a total of  shares to our executive officers 
these awards vest over four years starting on the first anniversary of the grant 
the fair value of each restricted stock award is estimated using the intrinsic value method that is based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards is recognized ratably over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
prior to  employees generally received stock option grants when joining the company and then may have received periodic awards thereafter in the discretion of the board and management  although the timing of additional awards has previously not been made according to any established policy 
the board intends all options to be granted with an exercise price equal to or greater than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant 
on each of the grant dates up until our common stock offering in june  the fair value of common stock underlying stock options granted was either estimated by the board on a contemporaneous basis with input from management and an independent valuation firm or was determined not to have changed since a prior valuation 
given the absence of a public trading market in our common stock through june  our board considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock at each meeting at which stock option grants were approved 
these factors included  but were not limited to  the following developments in our business  the rights and preferences of our convertible preferred stock relative to our common stock  independent valuations of our common stock  the lack of marketability of our common stock  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event  given prevailing market conditions  our current and historical operating performance and current financial condition  our operating and financial projections  the stock price performance of a peer group comprised of selected publicly traded companies identified as being comparable to us  and economic conditions and trends in the broad market for stocks 

table of contents if we had made different assumptions and estimates regarding the value of our stock at the time of the options being granted  the amount of our recognized and to be recognized stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
we believe that the board used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions in determining the fair value of our common stock 
we requested periodic valuation reports from an independent valuation firm  prepared consistent with the methods outlined in the american institute of certified public accountants practice guide  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation up until our common stock offering in june each valuation recommended a fair value of our common stock on a minority  non marketable basis as of the date of the report 
in valuing our common stock  our independent valuation firm determined our business enterprise value using two valuation approaches  an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach estimates the present value of future estimated debt free cash flows  based upon forecasted revenue and costs 
these discounted cash flows are added to the present value of our estimated enterprise terminal value  the multiple of which is derived from comparable company market data 
these future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a rate corresponding to our estimated weighted average cost of capital 
the discount rate is derived from an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of our publicly traded peer group as well as cost of capital studies for similar stage companies as of the valuation date and is adjusted to reflect the risk inherent in our cash flows 
the market approach estimates the fair value of a company by applying to that company the market multiples of comparable publicly traded companies 
a multiple of key metrics implied by the enterprise values or acquisition values of our publicly traded peers is calculated 
based on the range of these observed multiples  size of the company  company specific factors such as growth and margins  and professional judgment  an appropriate adjustment to the publicly traded companies median multiple is applied our metrics in order to derive an indication of value 
after determining a business enterprise value indication under each approach  the enterprise value was allocated to debt holders and then to each of our classes of stock using a liquidation analysis that took into consideration each class of shareholder rights and preferences to proceeds 
under each of the value indications based on the shareholder agreements  the preferred shareholders would automatically convert to common shareholders 
the two per share value indications were weighted to determine the concluded fair value of a share of common stock on a minority  non marketable basis 
upon our common stock offering in june  we have relied upon on the trading price of our common stock to determine fair value of our common stock 
with respect to equity grants made and up until our initial public offering in june  the key assumptions in the common stock valuations recommended by an independent valuation firm were as follows date of valuation discounted cash flows method guideline public company weighting discount for lack of marketability discounted cash flow discount rate common stock value march  for purposes of the march valuation report  the comparable publicly traded companies utilized in the market approach consisted of alliance data systems corporation  cybersource corp  mastercard incorporated  tns inc  total systems services  inc  visa  inc 
and financial engines  inc income taxes our deferred tax balances are dependent upon our estimation of the rates at which these deferred taxes will reduce in the future 
differences in our estimation of apportionment in future years would have an impact on the amount of deferred taxes we record as of any point in time 
business combinations in recording the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  we make estimates regarding customer retention rates  discount rates and future revenues among other things 
changes in the these estimates would have an impact on the amount of value assigned to our assets acquired and therefore impact the amount of amortization that is recorded in future periods 
in august  we acquired substantially all the assets of campus labs and under the acquisition method of accounting  the total fair value of consideration transferred was allocated to campus lab net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of august  in determining the fair value of these amounts  we made estimates regarding i the amount of future revenues to be derived from the technology in existence at the time of the acquisition  ii the amount of future revenues to be derived from the existing customers of campus labs at the time of the acquisition  iii the amount of revenues to be earned in which will determine the amount of our contingent consideration earn out payment to be made to the former owners of campus labs  iv the period of time over which the technology in existence at the time of the acquisition will be replaced  v the operating margin to be earned in the future  and vi the appropriate discount rates to use for each acquired asset and liability 
in most cases  an increase in our expected future revenues would have the impact of increasing the value ascribed to our identifiable intangible assets and thereby increasing future amortization expense and decreasing the amount of goodwill recorded 
in the case of our contingent consideration arrangement  increases in expected future revenues would increase our contingent consideration liability and also the amount of goodwill recorded 
we utilized discount rates ranging between and to determine the fair value of the acquired intangible assets and contingent consideration liability 
increases or decreases of in the discount rate would not have a material impact on the amount of acquired intangible assets  contingent consideration liability or goodwill recorded in the transaction 
our contingent consideration liability is considered a liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis which relies on unobservable inputs 
our contingent consideration liability is a potential earn out payment which is calculated by multiplying the amount of revenues for the acquired campus labs business in excess of million  if any  by subject to a maximum payment of million 
during the quarter ended december   we recorded an adjustment of million as a result of a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability 
the decrease in fair value of the contingent consideration liability was the result of a decrease in the revenues we expect to be generated by campus labs product suite during the contingent consideration payment is sensitive to changes in our estimates of the revenue to be earned during as a result of the multiplier referenced above 
the fair value of the liability  as measured at december   may diverge materially from the amount that we will pay to settle the liability as a result of the time that will pass between december  and when we make payments under the earn out arrangement in and 
table of contents results of operations for the years ended december   and the following tables summarize key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated  both in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of revenue year ended december  change from prior period in thousands of dollars in thousands of dollars percentage account revenue payment transaction revenue higher education institution revenue other revenue revenues before customer credit plan less customer credit plan revenue cost of revenue gross margin general and administrative product development sales and marketing merger and acquisition related expenses  net income from operations interest income interest expense other income net income before income taxes income tax expense net income year ended december  of revenue account revenue payment transaction revenue higher education institution revenue other revenue revenues before customer credit plan less customer credit plan revenue cost of revenue gross margin general and administrative product development sales and marketing merger and acquisition related expenses  net income from operations interest income interest expense other income net income before income taxes income tax expense net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  account revenue the increase in account revenue was primarily due to an increase in activity and overall transaction volume within our oneaccounts 
while the number of oneaccounts from december  to december  was relatively flat  there were more accounts that had activity during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in the number of oneaccounts which had activity during the year ended december  resulted in increases in interchange fees and other fees that our bank partners remit to us 
the number of oneaccounts as of december  was impacted by a change we made to close out low balance  inactive accounts during the year ended december  which led to the acceleration of closing out such accounts 
partially as a result of the accelerated closure of low balance  inactive accounts  there was a decrease of approximately thousand oneaccounts during the year ended december  for those oneaccounts affiliated with schools that were onedisburse clients as of december  there were approximately thousand oneaccounts as of december  which were affiliated with schools that began processing financial refunds using onedisburse during the year ended december  payment transaction revenue the increase in payment transaction revenue was primarily due to an increase in payments processed at higher education institutions that were utilizing the cashnet payment module  epayment  during the year ended december  as well as the inclusion of new higher education institution clients that began utilizing epayment since the year ended december  a portion of the increase was also due to the inclusion of revenue from mypaymentplan  a new service offered during the year ended december  
table of contents higher education institution revenue the increase in higher education institution revenue was primarily due to the inclusion of revenue from the acquisition of campus labs in august the campus labs suite of products contributed approximately million of revenue during the year ended december  the remaining increase in higher education revenue was primarily as a result of higher subscription revenue for our cashnet suite of payment products 
the increase in subscription revenue is generally due to the increase in number of new modules sold to previously existing higher education institution clients  as well as sales of the cashnet suite of payment products to new higher education institution clients over the course of the last twelve months 
customer credit plan in december  we initiated a plan which provided credits to certain current and former customers that were previously assessed certain insufficient fund fees 
as a result of this plan  we recorded a reduction in our revenue of approximately million in the insufficient funds fees that are credited to customers under this plan were originally assessed beginning in cost of revenue we generally expect cost of revenue to increase proportionally with our revenue as many of these costs are variable and associated with either the number of oneaccounts or the dollar volume of transactions processed through our cashnet payment module 
during the year ended december   our cost of revenue increased at a higher rate than revenue  which resulted in a decrease in our gross margin percentage of approximately percentage points compared to our data processing costs and our provision for operational loss both increased at higher rates than our revenue growth 
the year over year increase in our provision for operational losses was lower in the second half of  compared to the first half of the increase in data processing costs is due in part to a decrease in the growth rate of our oneaccount transaction volume  which led to an average higher per transaction cost during the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
general and administrative expense although general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase as our size grows  such expenses increased at a higher rate than our revenue growth during the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was driven primarily by increases in the following areas facilities related costs  including deprecation  employee compensation  and professional fees 
our facilities related costs  including depreciation  increased during the year ended december  as a result of the completion of the real estate development project at the end of as a result  we recorded a full year of depreciation on our new headquarters during the year ended december  our employee compensation and professional fees both increased during the year ended december   due in part to additional resources needed to support the transition to and maintenance of multiple bank partners 
product development expense the increase in product development expense was primarily due to increases in employee compensation costs due to an increase in the number of employees working in our product development area 
a significant portion of the increase in employee compensation costs is due to the employees hired in connection with our acquisition of campus labs in august sales and marketing expense the decrease in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to a decrease of million in the non cash  stock based sales acquisition expense related to the vesting of certain shares issued in connection with the acquisition of educard  llc 
the vesting time period related to the acquisition of educard  llc expired at december  and therefore there are no subsequent additional associated expenses 
the decrease in non cash stock based sales acquisition expense was partially offset by increases in marketing efforts and higher employee compensation costs to support business growth 
our marketing efforts included incentives we provided to our customers to increase the amount of direct deposits made into the oneaccounts of our customers and additional advertising and media costs 
a portion of the increase of both general marketing efforts and employee compensation costs is due to our acquisition of campus labs in august merger and acquisition related expenses  net our merger and acquisition related expenses during the three months ended september  related to our acquisition of campus labs in august these expenses include professional fees associated with the acquisition and related audit  a fair value adjustment to the contingent consideration component of the purchase price and certain employee related costs related to a bonus to be paid to employees previously employed by camps labs following a specified time period of employment by higher one 
during the period following the acquisition of campus labs  we recorded fair value adjustments to the contingent consideration component of the purchase price totaling million which reduced the liability and also reduced our operating expenses 
we will continue to record fair value adjustments to the contingent consideration liability as necessary until the payment of all amounts due under the agreement 
the employee related costs will continue to generate expense through the six month anniversary of the acquisition date 
interest expense the increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
during the year ended december   we had amounts outstanding under our credit facility ranging from million  which we borrowed in connection with the acquisition of campus labs  and million  which was outstanding as of december  during the year ended december   a zero balance was maintained on the credit facility 
during the year ended december   we also recorded higher amortization of deferred financing costs as a result of us entering into the october facility as defined below 
other income we recorded million of other income during the year ended december   as a result of the settlement agreement reached with the former stockholders of idc

income tax expense the increase in income tax expense was primarily due to the increase in net income before taxes  but there were also two factors which reduced our tax rate in that did not recur in the gain we recorded as a result of the settlement agreement with the former stockholders of idc of million did not have any tax impact for the year ended december  in addition  we recorded a deferred tax benefit of approximately million during the year ended december  as a result of a decrease in the expected rate that certain of our deferred tax liabilities will reverse

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  account revenue the increase in account revenue was primarily due to an increase of  or million  in the number of oneaccounts from december  to december  greater adoption of the oneaccount at existing higher education institution clients accounted for of the increase in oneaccounts 
the remaining increase was due to students choosing the oneaccount at higher education institutions which became clients after december  the increase in the number of oneaccounts resulted in increases in interchange fees  atm fees and other fees that our bank partner remits to us 
payment transaction revenue the increase in payment transaction revenue was primarily due to an increase in payments processed at higher education institutions that were utilizing the cashnet payment module  epayment  during the year ended december  as well as the inclusion of new higher education institution clients that began utilizing epayment since the year ended december  higher education institution revenue the increase in higher education institution revenue was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue for our cashnet suite of payment products 
the increase in subscription revenue is generally due to the increase in number of new modules sold to previously existing higher education institution clients  as well as sales of the cashnet suite of payment products to new higher education institution clients over the course of the increase in higher education institution revenue was also supported by growth in the financial aid disbursement revenues generated by our onedisburse refund management disbursement service 
customer credit plan in december  we initiated a plan which provided credits to certain current and former customers that were previously assessed certain insufficient fund fees 
as a result of this plan  we recorded a reduction in our revenue of approximately million in the insufficient funds fees that are credited to customers under this plan were originally assessed beginning in of the total charge of million  an accrual of approximately million was established for amounts which were paid in the first quarter of cost of revenue our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately percentage points compared to approximately of that decrease was as a result of the credits that we agreed to provide to customers during discussed above 
the remaining decrease in margin is primarily related to higher costs associated with honoring mastercard zero liability protection to our customers 
these higher costs included approximately million of losses associated with a theft at an unrelated third party merchant which impacted our customers  which was a component of this overall increase 
general and administrative expense although general and administrative expenses continue to increase as our size grows  such expenses increased at a lower rate than our revenue growth 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was driven primarily by increases in employee compensation  professional fees  depreciation  and losses recorded on the disposal of atms 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to grow at a rate slower than revenue growth in the future 
sales and marketing expense the increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to an increase of million in the non cash  stock based sales acquisition expense related to the vesting of certain shares issued in connection with the acquisition of educard due to a higher average share price at the date of vesting 
the remainder of the increase was the result of increases in certain marketing efforts during  including additional tradeshow participation and higher employee compensation costs to support business growth 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower amortization of deferred financing costs of the december facility as defined below  compared to our prior credit facility that was in place during  and accretion of our acquisition payable which became fully accreted by december  during the year ended december   a zero balance was maintained on our credit facility
