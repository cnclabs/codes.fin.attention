item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an independent energy company focused on the development  exploration  exploitation  acquisition  and production of natural gas and crude oil properties in the us gulf coast region and in south america 
our oil and gas reserves and operations are concentrated primarily in the south american country of colombia and in the onshore gulf coast region  particularly texas and louisiana 
our mission is to deliver outstanding net asset value per share growth to our investors via attractive oil and gas investments 
our strategy is to focus on early identification of  and entrance into  existing and emerging resource plays  particularly in south america and the us gulf coast 
we typically seek to partner with larger operators in development of resources or retain interests  with or without contribution on our part  in prospects identified  packaged and promoted to larger operators 
by entering these plays earlier and partnering with  or promoting to  larger operators  we believe we can capture larger resource potential at lower cost and minimize our exposure to drilling risks and costs and ongoing operating costs 
we  along with our partners  actively manage our resources through opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures where reserves can be identified  developed  monetized and financial resources redeployed with the objective of growing reserves  production and shareholder value 
generally  we generate nearly all our revenues and cash flows from the sale of produced natural gas and crude oil  whether through royalty interests  working interests or other arrangements 
we may also realize gains and additional cash flows from the periodic divestiture of assets 
recent developments drilling activity during  we drilled international wells in colombia  as follows wells were drilled on the la cuerva concession in which we hold a working interest  of which were completed and brought onto production both wells were sold in connection with the sale of our interest in hc  llc 
see sale of la cuerva and lla blocks 
wells were drilled on the cpo block in colombia  each of which was determined to be non commercial 
at december   no wells were being drilled 
during  no domestic wells were drilled 
sale of la cuerva and lla blocks during the first quarter of  we sold all of our interest in hupecol cuerva  llc hc  llc  which holds interests in the la cuerva block and  pending approval of the colombian authorities  the lla block  together covering approximately  acres in the llanos basin in colombia 
hc  llc sold for million  adjusted for working capital 
of the sales price of hc  llc will be held in escrow to fund potential claims arising from the sale 
pursuant to our ownership interest in hc  llc  we received in the net sale proceeds after deduction of commissions  overriding royalty interest  and transaction expenses  subject to the escrow holdback and a further contingency holdback by hupecol of of the sales price 
following completion of the sale of hc  llc  we have no continuing interest in the la cuerva and lla blocks 
at december   our estimated proved reserves associated with the la cuerva and lla blocks totaled  barrels of oil  which represented of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
sales of oil and gas properties under the full cost method of accounting are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless the adjustment significantly alters the relationship between capitalized costs and reserves 
since the sale of these oil and gas properties would significantly alter the relationship  we recognized a gain on the sale of  during  computed as follows 
table of contents sales price add transfer of asset retirement and other obligations less transaction costs less prepaid deposits less carrying value of oil and gas properties  net net gain on sale the following table presents pro forma data that reflects revenue  income from continuing operations  net loss and loss per common share for and as if the hc  llc sale had occurred at the beginning of each period and excludes the gain on sale 
pro forma information oil and gas revenue loss from operations net loss basic and diluted loss per common share capital expenditure program during  we invested  for the development of oil and gas properties  consisting of drilling and drilling preparation costs on wells in colombia of  and leasehold costs on us properties of  cpo developments during  we completed operations on three test wells on our cpo block in colombia 
each of the test wells was determined to be noncommercial and was plugged and abandoned 
as a result of the determinations to plug and abandon each of those test wells  we included the costs related to those wells in the full cost pool for inclusion in the ceiling test 
we recorded an impairment charge of  during to write off costs not being amortized that were attributable to the drilling of the test wells on the cpo block as well as to write off seismic exploration and evaluation cost  general and administrative cost and environmental and governmental cost that were attributable to the test wells through december  following drilling of the unsuccessful test wells on the cpo prospect  in march  we entered into a settlement agreement with sk innovation  operator of the cpo prospect  and terminated our interest in the prospect and were released from past and future funding and other obligations relating to the prospect  including our accrued cash call commitments of  serrania developments with respect to development of our serrania block  the national hydrocarbon agency of colombia the anh has granted extensions of required development commitments  including drilling of a first test well  until security conditions allow operations 
based on those conditions  we anticipate that drilling of a first test well on the serrania block will occur in gulf united note receivable as a result of gulf united energy s delinquency in satisfying its financial obligations with respect to the cpo prospect  during  we wrote off our receivable from gulf united for  
table of contents financing activities on may   we sold to institutional investors  units  with each unit consisting of one of our common shares and one warrant to purchase one common share  for gross proceeds of approximately million  before deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses of  recorded as cost of capital  in a registered direct offering

the sec is investigating whether there have been any violations of the federal securities laws and appears to have narrowed the focus of their investigation to matters relating to disclosures in the late and early time period regarding resource potential for the cpo prospect 
we have presented information supporting our disclosure relative to resource potential on the cpo prospect 
the investigation does not represent a conclusion by the staff that there have been any violations of the federal securities laws nor whether the staff would conclude that any enforcement action is appropriate 
at this time  we have not been made aware of a finding by the sec of any securities violations 
also  as stated in the subpoenas issued by the sec  the investigation does not mean that the sec has a negative opinion of any person  entity or security 
we have cooperated fully  and are committed to continuing to cooperate fully  with the sec in this matter 
it is not possible at this time to predict the timing or outcome of the sec investigation  including whether or when any proceedings might be initiated  when these matters may be resolved or what  if any  penalties or other remedies may be imposed  and whether any such penalties or remedies would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

strategic alternative review in july  our board authorized the engagement of an investment banking firm  and we engaged canaccord genuity  inc  to assist in the evaluation of a broad range of financial and strategic alternatives  including  but not limited to  seeking additional financing to support the long term development of our oil and gas properties  seeking financial and or industry partners to participate in the development of our properties  selling some of or all of our assets or interests in those assets  and the possible sale of our company  among other alternatives 
our board concluded the review of strategic alternatives determining that satisfactory alternatives were not available and that we should seek additional financing to support the ongoing development of our assets 
following that determination  we consummated the october  financing described above 
colombian tax during  we engaged our tax advisors in colombia to evaluate certain tax and other filings made in colombia by them and other advisors for  and our advisors identified inconsistencies between tax and non tax filings with respect to equity investments made by us in colombia 
based on guidance from our advisors  during we recorded a current foreign tax liability of  which we expect to pay during  and a non current foreign tax liability of  which we expect to pay during  relating primarily to a newly enacted colombian equity tax measure based on the equity of our colombian branch as of january  critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting 
such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  our reported results of operations would be different should we employ an alternative accounting method 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  costs of drilling  completing and equipping successful and unsuccessful oil and gas wells and related internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities  but does not include any cost related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized unless significant amounts of oil and gas reserves are involved 
no corporate overhead has been capitalized as of december  the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves  are amortized on a units of production method over the estimated productive life of the reserves 
unevaluated oil and gas properties are excluded from this calculation 
the capitalized oil and gas property costs  less accumulated amortization  are limited to an amount the ceiling limitation equal to the sum of a the present value of estimated future net revenues from the projected production of proved oil and gas reserves  calculated using the average oil and natural gas sales price received by the company as of the first trading day of each month over the preceding twelve months such prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties and a discount factor of  b the cost of unproved and unevaluated properties excluded from the costs being amortized  c the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  and d related income tax effects 
costs in excess of this ceiling are charged to proved properties impairment expense 

table of contents unevaluated oil and gas properties 
unevaluated oil and gas properties consist principally of our cost of acquiring and evaluating undeveloped leases  net of an allowance for impairment and transfers to depletable oil and gas properties 
when leases are developed  expire or are abandoned  the related costs are transferred from unevaluated oil and gas properties to oil and gas properties subject to amortization 
additionally  we review the carrying costs of unevaluated oil and gas properties for the purpose of determining probable future lease expirations and abandonments  and prospective discounted future economic benefit attributable to the leases 
unevaluated oil and gas properties not subject to amortization include the following at december  and at december  at december  acquisition costs evaluation costs total the carrying value of unevaluated oil and gas prospects includes  and  expended for properties in south america at december  and december   respectively 
we are maintaining our interest in these properties and development has or is anticipated to commence within the next twelve months 
stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the volatility of our common stock price over the expected life of the options  dividend yield  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the statements of operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas revenues 
total oil and gas revenues decreased  to  in from  in the decrease in revenue was due to the sale of our interest in the la cuerva block 
the following table sets forth the gross and net producing wells  net oil and gas production volumes and average hydrocarbon sales prices for and gross producing wells net producing wells net oil production bbls net gas production mcf oil average sales price per barrel gas average sales price per mcf the change in gross and net producing wells and production reflects the sale  during the first quarter of  of our interest in wells associated with the la cuerva block

lease operating expenses  excluding joint venture expenses relating to our colombian operations discussed below  decreased to  in from  in the decrease in total lease operating expenses was attributable to the sale of our interest in the la cuerva block 
following is a summary comparison of lease operating expenses for the periods 
colombia us total consistent with our business model and operating history  we experience steep declines in lease operating expenses following strategic divestitures and anticipate lease operating expenses to ramp up to levels consistent with regional costs as new wells are brought on line 
joint venture expenses 
joint venture expenses totaled  in compared to  in the joint venture expenses represent our allocable share of the indirect field operating and region administrative expenses billed by hupecol 
the decrease in joint venture expenses was attributable to reduced allocated administrative costs following the march divestiture of assets operated by hupecol 
depreciation and depletion expense 
depreciation and depletion expense decreased by to  in from  in the decrease in depreciation and depletion was due to the sale of assets discussed above 
gain loss on sale of oil and gas properties 
the sale of our indirect interests in hupecol cuerva  llc and post closing price adjustments related to the sale resulted in a gain of  during post closing purchase price adjustments relating to our sale of colombian assets and our prior sale of colombian assets resulted in a loss on sale of oil and gas properties of  in impairment expense 
termination of our testing and completion efforts on  and abandonment of  three test wells on our cpo block resulted in impairment expense of  during general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense increased by to  in from  in the change in general and administrative expense reflects a combination of an increase in legal fees and professional fees up  relating to litigation commenced during and the ongoing sec investigation  a decrease in non cash stock based compensation down  reflecting lower stock price and a resulting lower value of equity grants  and decreased cash compensation down  attributable to reduced bonuses paid during bad debt expense 
as a result of gulf united energy s delinquency in satisfying its financial obligations with respect to the cpo prospect  during  we wrote down our receivable from gulf united for  foreign equity tax 
during  we recorded an foreign equity tax expense of  relating to a newly enacted colombian equity tax measure based on the equity of our colombian branch as of january  other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest earned on cash balances net of other bank fees 
net other expense totaled  in as compared to net other expense of  in the change was attributable to reduced interest income during reflecting lower interest rates and lower cash holdings

we reported income tax expense of approximately  in as compared to an income tax benefit of approximately million in during  we generated net operating losses  from which a current benefit in the amount of million was realized as a result of carrying back the respective net operating losses to the current tax benefit was entirely offset by the release in the valuation allowance 
we expect a refund of us income taxes in the amount of approximately million as a result of such net operating loss carryback 
except for this tax benefit  we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets at the end of will not be realized 
as such  we fully reserved all of the net deferred tax assets at december  financial condition liquidity and capital resources 
at december   we had a cash balance of  and working capital of  compared to a cash balance of  and working capital of  at december  the decrease in cash and working capital during was primarily attributable to the operating losses incurred during  including the costs of drilling operations on the cpo block which were written off during  partially offset by the receipt of approximately  from capital raising transactions during as a result of our settlement with sk innovation  subsequent to year end  we received a release from our accrued capital call commitments on cpo which totaled  at december  as adjusted to reflect the release of such commitments  our pro forma working capital at december  totaled  cash flows 
operating activities used  of cash during compared to  of cash used during the decrease in cash used in operations was primarily attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities and various non cash expenses which more than offset the increase in net loss 
investing activities used  of cash during as compared to  of cash used during funds used in investing activities during principally reflect investments in oil and gas properties and assets of  and purchases of marketable securities of  partially offset by proceeds from sale of securities of  escrow receivable of  and proceeds from the sale of our interest in hupecol cuerva  llc of  financing activities provided  of cash during from our may and october offerings of common stock and warrants 
long term liabilities 
at december   we had long term liabilities of  as compared to  at december  long term liabilities at december  consisted of reserve for plugging costs  and foreign income taxes of  long term liabilities at december  consisted of a reserve for plugging costs and deferred rent liability 
capital and exploration expenditures and commitments 
our principal capital and exploration expenditures relate to our ongoing efforts to acquire  drill and complete prospects 
during  we invested  for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties  which included expenses related to drilling of wells in colombia  including the drilling costs on two wells on the la cuerva block sold during  as well as leasehold costs on us properties 
at december   our only material contractual obligation requiring determinable future payments on our part was our lease relating to our executive offices 
the following table details our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period total year years years years operating leases total in addition to the contractual obligations requiring that we make fixed payments  in conjunction with our efforts to secure oil and gas prospects  financing and services  we have  from time to time  granted overriding royalty interests orri in various properties  and may grant orris in the future  pursuant to which we will be obligated to pay a portion of our interest in revenues from various prospects to third parties 
all present and future prospects in colombia are subject to a orri in favor of each of john terwilliger and o

planned drilling  leasehold and other activities 
as of december   our acquisition and drilling budget for totaled approximately million and related principally to drilling wells on the serrania block  and shooting seismic on the los picachos and macaya concessions 
additional wells may be drilled at locations to be determined based on the results of the planned drilling projects 
our acquisition and drilling budget has historically been subject to substantial fluctuation over the course of a year based upon successes and failures in drilling and completion of prospects and the identification of additional prospects during the course of a year 

table of contents we intend to fund our drilling budget from a combination of cash on hand and the anticipated receipt of funds from income tax refunds of approximately million and release of restricted cash backing a letter of credit expiring in april of approximately million 
we have no commitments to provide any additional financing should we require and seek such financing and there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all  if necessary to fully fund our drilling budget and to support future acquisitions and development activities 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements or guarantees of third party obligations at december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations since inception 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the price we receive for our oil and gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
crude oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for production depends on numerous factors beyond our control 
we have not historically entered into any hedges or other derivative commodity instruments or transactions designed to manage  or limit exposure to oil and gas price volatility
