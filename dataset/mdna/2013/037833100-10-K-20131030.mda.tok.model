esps reflect the company s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
for sales of qualifying versions of ios devices  mac and apple tv  the company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers 
the company also provides various non software services to owners of qualifying versions of ios devices and mac 
because the company has neither vsoe nor tpe for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non software services  revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the company s esps 
revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non software services based on the company s esps is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices  which ranges from two to four years 
the company s process for determining esps involves management s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
should future facts and circumstances change  the company s esps and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades and non software services related to future sales of these devices could change 
factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered  the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights  the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non software services  and the estimated period software upgrades and non software services are expected to be provided 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs 
for transactions involving price protection  the company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded  provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
the company s policy requires that  if refunds cannot be reliably estimated  revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses 
for the company s other customer incentive programs  the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered 
the company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the company s historical experience 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue 
additionally  certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs 
if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives  the company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue  which would have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
valuation and impairment of marketable securities the company s investments in available for sale securities are reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of available for sale securities 
table of contents impact the company s net income only when such securities are sold or an other than temporary impairment is recognized 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security s cost basis 
the company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other than temporarily impaired  which would require the company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made 
in making this judgment  the company evaluates  among other things  the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost  the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto  and the company s intent to sell  or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell  the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
the company s assessment on whether a security is other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security 
inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing process equipment  including capital assets held at its suppliers facilities 
in addition  the company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components 
the company records a write down for inventories of components and products  including third party products held for resale  which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
the company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans  current sales levels  and component cost trends 
the company also reviews its manufacturing related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the company determines that an asset is not recoverable  it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value 
the industries in which the company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes 
in certain circumstances the company may be required to record additional write downs of inventory  inventory prepayments and or manufacturing related capital assets 
these circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the company s products being less favorable than forecasted  unforeseen technological changes or changes to the company s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets  or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the company s suppliers that hold any of the company s manufacturing process equipment or to whom the company has made an inventory prepayment 
such write downs would adversely affect the company s results of operations in the period when the write downs were recorded 
the company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled 
consistent with industry practice  the company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders  supplier contracts  and open orders in each case based on projected demand 
where appropriate  the purchases are applied to inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the respective supplier 
purchase commitments typically cover the company s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to days 
if there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the company s products  if the company s product development plans change  or if there is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the company s products  then the company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded 
warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates  historical and projected cost per claim  and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the company s typical experience 
each quarter  the company reevaluates 
table of contents these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
if actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the company s results of operations 
income taxes the company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets 
in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of gaap and complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
legal and other contingencies as discussed in part i  item of this form k under the heading legal proceedings and in part ii  item of this form k in the notes to consolidated financial statements in note  commitments and contingencies  the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
the company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
there is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
in the opinion of management  there was not at least a reasonable possibility the company may have incurred a material loss  or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual  with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies 
however  the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty 
therefore  although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote  if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management s expectations  the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and foreign currency risk management the company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures 
given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures  there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
further  the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s financial condition and operating results 
interest rate risk investments while the company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income is most sensitive to fluctuations in us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  the fair value of those securities  as well as costs associated with hedging 
the company s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company 
a portion of the company s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the company s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks 
the company s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company typically invests in highly rated securities  and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the policy requires investments generally to be investment grade  with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s investment portfolio  the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
based on investment positions as of september   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of september   a similar basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio 
such losses would only be realized if the company sold the investments prior to maturity 
long term debt in the third quarter of  the company issued billion of long term debt  which included billion of floating rate notes 
to manage the risk of fluctuations in interest rates associated with the floating rate notes  the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion  which  in effect  fixed the interest rate of the floating rate notes 
foreign currency risk in general  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  will negatively affect the company s net sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
there is a risk that the company will have to adjust local 
table of contents currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities  certain firmly committed transactions  forecasted future cash flows  and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the company s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures  typically for up to months 
however  the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company s foreign currency derivative positions  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions 
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value  for a given confidence interval  to the company s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model assumes normal market conditions 
forecasted transactions  firm commitments  and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
based on the results of the model  the company estimates with confidence a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  compared to a maximum one day loss in fair value of million as of september  because the company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes  the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
actual future gains and losses associated with the company s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of september  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates and the company s actual exposures and positions
