recent developments and significant events regulatory actions on march   the memorandum of understanding mou by and between banner bank and the fdic and washington dfi originally effective march  was terminated 
on april   the mou by and between the company and the federal reserve bank of san francisco originally effective march  was also terminated 
income tax reporting and accounting amended federal income tax returns on october   the company filed amended federal income tax returns for tax years   and the amended tax returns  which are under review by the internal revenue service irs  significantly affect the timing for recognition of credit losses within previously filed income tax returns and  if approved  would result in the refund of up to million of previously paid taxes from the utilization of net operating loss carryback claims into prior tax years 
the outcome of the anticipated irs review is inherently uncertain and since there can be no assurance of approval of some or all of the tax carryback claims  no asset has been recognized to reflect the possible results of these amendments as of december  accordingly  the company does not anticipate recognizing any tax benefit until the results of the irs review have been determined 
we expect this review to be completed and the issue resolved during deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company and the banks file consolidated us federal income tax returns  as well as state income tax returns in oregon and idaho 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the enacted tax rates which are expected to be in effect when the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities are expected to be reported in the company s income tax returns 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
under gaap  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
while realization of the deferred tax asset is ultimately dependent on sustained profitability  the guidance reflected in the accounting standard is significantly influenced by consideration of recent historical operating results 
during  the company evaluated its net deferred tax asset and determined it was prudent to establish a valuation allowance against the entire asset 
as a result  we recorded an million income tax expense for the year ended december  no tax benefit or expense was recognized during during the year ended december   management analyzed the company performance and trends  focusing on trends in asset quality  loan loss provisioning  capital position  net interest margin  core operating income and net income and the likelihood of continued profitability 
based on this analysis  management determined that a full valuation allowance was no longer appropriate and reversed all of the valuation allowance during the year ended december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
stockholder equity transactions preferred stock on march   the company million of series a preferred stock with a liquidation value of  per share  originally issued to the us treasury treasury as part of its capital purchase program  was sold by the treasury as part of its efforts to manage and recover its investments under the troubled asset relief program tarp 
while the sale of these preferred shares to new owners did not result in any proceeds to the company and did not change the company capital position or accounting for these securities  it did eliminate restrictions put in place by the treasury on tarp recipients 
the treasury retained its related warrants to purchase up to million in banner common stock 
subsequently  during  the company repurchased or redeemed its series a preferred stock  realizing gains aggregating million  which partially offset the accelerated amortization of a portion of the initial discount recorded at the issuance of the series a preferred stock 
in addition  dividends paid in on the series a preferred stock were reduced by the retirement of the repurchased shares 
lending activities general all of our lending activities are conducted through banner bank  its subsidiary  community financial corporation  and islanders bank 
we offer a wide range of loan products to meet the demands of our customers and our loan portfolio is very diversified by product type  borrower and geographic location within our market area 
we originate loans for our own loan portfolio and for sale in the secondary market 
management s strategy has been to maintain a well diversified portfolio with a significant percentage of assets in the loan portfolio having more frequent interest rate repricing terms or shorter maturities than traditional long term fixed rate mortgage loans 
as part of this effort  we have developed a variety of floating or adjustable interest rate products that correlate more closely with our cost of funds  particularly loans for commercial business and real estate  agricultural business  and construction and development purposes 
however  in response to customer demand  we continue to originate fixed rate loans  including fixed interest rate mortgage loans with terms of up to years 
the relative amount of fixed rate loans and adjustable rate loans that can be originated at any time is largely determined by the demand for each in a competitive environment 
historically  our lending activities have been primarily directed toward the origination of real estate and commercial loans 
prior to  real estate lending activities were significantly focused on residential construction and land development and first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residential properties  however  over the subsequent four years our origination of construction and land development loans declined materially and the proportion of the portfolio invested in these types of loans has declined substantially 
during and particularly in  we experienced more demand for one to four family construction loans and outstanding balances have increased modestly 
our residential mortgage loan originations also decreased during the earlier years of this cycle  although less significantly than the decline in construction and land development lending as exceptionally low interest rates supported demand for loans to refinance existing debt as well as loans to finance home purchases 
refinancing activity was particularly significant during  which resulted in a meaningful increase in residential mortgage originations compared to the same period a year earlier 
despite the recent increase in these loan originations  our outstanding balances for residential mortgages have continued to decline  as most of the new originations have been sold in the secondary market while existing residential loans have been repaying at an accelerated pace 
our real estate lending activities also include the origination of multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
while reduced from periods prior to the economic slowdown  our level of activity and investment in these types of loans has been relatively stable in recent periods 
our commercial business lending is directed toward meeting the credit and related deposit needs of various small to medium sized business and agribusiness borrowers operating in our primary market areas 
reflecting the weak economy  in recent periods demand for these types of commercial business loans has been modest and  aside from seasonal variations  total outstanding balances have not significantly increased or decreased 
our consumer lending activity is primarily directed at meeting demand from our existing deposit customers and  while we have increased our emphasis on consumer lending in recent years  demand for consumer loans also has been modest during this period of economic weakness as we believe many consumers have been focused on reducing their personal debt 
at december   our net loan portfolio totaled billion compared to billion at december  for additional information concerning our loan portfolio  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and loans and lending including tables and  which sets forth the composition and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio  and tables and  which contain information regarding the loans maturing in our portfolio 
one to four family residential real estate lending at both banner bank and islanders bank  we originate loans secured by first mortgages on one to four family residences in the northwest communities where we have offices 
while we offer a wide range of products  we have not engaged in any sub prime lending programs  which we define as loans to borrowers with poor credit histories or undocumented repayment capabilities and with excessive reliance on the collateral as the source of repayment 
however  in recent years we have experienced a modest increase in delinquencies on our residential loans in response to the weakened housing market conditions 
at december   million  or of our loan portfolio  consisted of permanent loans on one to four family residences 
we offer fixed and adjustable rate mortgages arms at rates and terms competitive with market conditions  primarily with the intent of selling these loans into the secondary market 
fixed rate loans generally are offered on a fully amortizing basis for terms ranging from to years at interest rates and fees that reflect current secondary market pricing 
most arm products offered adjust annually after an initial period ranging from one to five years  subject to a limitation on the annual change of to and a lifetime limitation of to 
for a small portion of the portfolio  where the initial period exceeds one year  the first rate change may exceed the annual limitation on subsequent rate changes 
our arm products most frequently adjust based upon the average yield on treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year or certain london interbank offered rate libor indices plus a margin or spread above the index 
arm loans held in our portfolio may allow for interest only payments for an initial period up to five years but do not provide for negative amortization of principal and carry no prepayment restrictions 
the retention of arm loans in our loan portfolio can help reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates 
however  borrower demand for arm loans versus fixed rate mortgage loans is a function of the level of interest rates  the expectations of changes in the level of interest rates and the difference between the initial interest rates and fees charged for each type of loan 
in recent years  borrower demand for arm loans has been limited and we have chosen not to aggressively pursue arm loans by offering minimally profitable  deeply discounted teaser rates or option payment arm products 
as a result  arm loans have represented only a small portion of our loans originated during this period and of our portfolio 
our residential loans are generally underwritten and documented in accordance with the guidelines established by the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac or fhlmc and the federal national mortgage association fannie mae or fnma 
government insured loans are underwritten and documented in accordance with the guidelines established by the department of housing and urban development hud and the veterans administration va 
in the loan approval process  we assess the borrower s ability to repay the loan  the adequacy of the proposed security  the employment stability of the borrower and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
for arm loans  our standard practice provides for underwriting based upon fully indexed interest rates and payments 
generally  we will lend up to of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property on conventional loans  although higher loan to value ratios are available on certain government insured programs 
we require private mortgage insurance on conventional residential loans with a loan to value ratio at origination exceeding 
for the past four years  particularly in and  a number of exceptions to these general underwriting guidelines were granted in connection with the sale or refinance of properties  particularly new construction  for which we were already providing financing 
these exceptions most commonly relate to loan to value and mortgage insurance requirements and not to credit underwriting or loan documentation standards 
such exceptions  while less frequent in recent periods  will likely continue in the near term to facilitate troubled loan resolution and may result in loans having performance characteristics different from the rest of our one to four family loan portfolio 
through our mortgage banking activities  we sell residential loans on either a servicing retained or servicing released basis 
during the past three years  we have sold a significant portion of our conventional residential mortgage originations and nearly all of our government insured loans in the secondary market 
construction and land lending historically  we have invested a significant portion of our loan portfolio in residential construction and land loans to professional home builders and developers  however  as housing markets weakened the amount of this investment was substantially reduced in recent years 
in years prior to  residential construction and land development lending was an area of major emphasis at banner bank and the primary focus of its subsidiary  cfc 
to a lesser extent  we also originate construction loans for commercial and multifamily real estate 
more recently  in response to improvement in certain sub markets  our construction and development lending increased in and and made a meaningful contribution to increased revenues and profitability in those years 
although well diversified with respect to sub markets  price ranges and borrowers  our construction and land loans are significantly concentrated in the greater puget sound region of washington state and the portland  oregon market area 
at december   construction and land loans totaled million  or of total loans of the company  consisting of million of one to four family construction loans  million of residential land or land development loans  million of commercial and multifamily real estate construction loans and million of commercial land or land development loans 
construction and land lending affords us the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than are usually available on other types of lending 
construction and land lending  however  involves a higher degree of risk than other lending opportunities because of the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost of the project 
if the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate  we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project 
if the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate  we may be confronted at  or prior to  the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment 
disagreements between borrowers and builders and the failure of builders to pay subcontractors may also jeopardize projects 
loans to builders to construct homes for which no purchaser has been identified carry additional risk because the payoff for the loan is dependent on the builder s ability to sell the property before the construction loan is due 
we attempt to address these risks by adhering to strict underwriting policies  disbursement procedures and monitoring practices 
construction loans made by us include those with a sales contract or permanent loan in place for the finished homes and those for which purchasers for the finished homes may be identified either during or following the construction period 
we actively monitor the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing markets to attempt to maintain an appropriate balance between home sales and new loan originations 
the maximum number of speculative loans loans that are not pre sold approved for each builder is based on a combination of factors  including the financial capacity of the builder  the market demand for the finished product and the ratio of sold to unsold inventory the builder maintains 
we have attempted to diversify the risk associated with speculative construction lending by doing business with a large number of small and mid sized builders spread over a relatively large geographic region with numerous sub markets within our three state service area 
loans for the construction of one to four family residences are generally made for a term of twelve to eighteen months 
our loan policies include maximum loan to value ratios of up to for speculative loans 
individual speculative loan requests are supported by an independent appraisal of the property  a set of plans  a cost breakdown and a completed specifications form 
underwriting is focused on the borrowers financial strength  credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively market and manage their operations 
all speculative construction loans must be approved by senior loan officers 
historically  we have also made land loans to developers  builders and individuals to finance the acquisition and or development of improved lots or unimproved land  although over the past five years we generally have not originated this type of loan 
in making land loans  we follow underwriting policies and disbursement and monitoring procedures similar to those for construction loans 
the initial term on land loans is typically one to three years with interest only payments  payable monthly  and provisions for principal reduction as lots are sold and released from the lien of the mortgage 
we regularly monitor the construction and land loan portfolios and the economic conditions and housing inventory in each of our markets and increase or decrease this type of lending as we observe market conditions change 
housing markets in most areas of the pacific northwest significantly deteriorated beginning in and our origination of new construction loans declined sharply as a result  however  our level of construction lending has increased in the past two years as certain sub markets have improved 
we believe that the underwriting policies and internal monitoring systems we have in place have helped to mitigate some of the risks inherent in construction and land lending  however  weak housing market conditions nonetheless resulted in material delinquencies and charge offs in our construction and land loan portfolios in recent years 
while construction and land loans  including residential  commercial and multifamily  have been meaningfully reduced  they still represent of our portfolio 
reducing the amount of non performing construction and land development loans and related real estate acquired through foreclosure was the most critical issue that we needed to resolve to return to acceptable levels of profitability and we have made substantial progress during the past three years in this regard  as reflected in the decline in non performing construction and land loans to of non performing loans at december  from of non performing loans at december  the most significant risk in this portfolio relates to the land development loans in a few areas where demand for building lots remains weak 
see asset quality below and item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset quality 
commercial and multifamily real estate lending we originate loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate including  as noted above  loans for construction of multifamily and commercial real estate projects 
commercial real estate loans are made for both owner occupied and investor properties 
at december   our loan portfolio included million in multifamily and billion in commercial real estate loans  including million in owner occupied commercial real estate loans and million in non owner occupied commercial real estate loans  which in aggregate comprised of our total loans 
multifamily and commercial real estate lending affords us an opportunity to receive interest at rates higher than those generally available from one to four family residential lending 
however  loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties are generally greater in amount  more difficult to evaluate and monitor and  therefore  potentially riskier than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by multifamily and commercial properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the properties  repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
in addition  many of our commercial and multifamily real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity 
such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment  which may increase the risk of default or non payment 
in originating multifamily and commercial real estate loans  we consider the location  marketability and overall attractiveness of the properties 
our underwriting guidelines for multifamily and commercial real estate loans require an appraisal from a qualified independent appraiser and an economic analysis of each property with regard to the annual revenue and expenses  debt service coverage and fair value to determine the maximum loan amount 
in the approval process we assess the borrowers willingness and ability to manage the property and repay the loan and the adequacy of the collateral in relation to the loan amount 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated by us are both fixed and adjustable rate loans generally with intermediate terms of five to ten years 
most of our multifamily and commercial real estate loans are linked to various federal home loan bank fhlb advance rates  certain prime rates or other market rate indices 
rates on these adjustable rate loans generally adjust with a frequency of one to five years after an initial fixed rate period ranging from one to ten years 
our commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans on a variety of property types with no large concentrations by property type  location or borrower 
at december   the average size of our commercial real estate loans was  and the largest commercial real estate loan in our portfolio was approximately million 
commercial business lending we are active in small to medium sized business lending and are engaged to a lesser extent in agricultural lending primarily by providing crop production loans 
our commercial bankers are focused on local markets and devote a great deal of effort to developing customer relationships and the ability to serve these types of borrowers with a full array of products and services delivered in a thorough and responsive manner 
while also strengthening our commitment to small business lending  in recent years we have added experienced officers and staff focused on corporate lending opportunities for borrowers with credit needs generally in a million to million range 
in addition to providing earning assets  this type of lending has helped us increase our deposit base 
expanding commercial lending and related commercial banking services is currently an area of significant focus  including recent reorganization and additions to staffing in the areas of business development  credit administration  small business administration sba lending  and loan and deposit operations 
commercial business loans may entail greater risk than other types of loans 
commercial business loans may be unsecured or secured by special purpose or rapidly depreciating assets  such as equipment  inventory and receivables  which may not provide an adequate source of repayment on defaulted loans 
in addition  commercial business loans are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial strength and management ability  as well as market conditions for various products  services and commodities 
for these reasons  commercial business loans generally provide higher yields or related revenue opportunities than many other types of loans but also require more administrative and management attention 
loan terms  including the fixed or adjustable interest rate  the loan maturity and the collateral considerations  vary significantly and are negotiated on an individual loan basis 
we underwrite our commercial business loans on the basis of the borrower s cash flow and ability to service the debt from earnings rather than on the basis of the underlying collateral value 
we seek to structure these loans so that they have more than one source of repayment 
the borrower is required to provide us with sufficient information to allow us to make a prudent lending determination 
in most instances  this information consists of at least three years of financial statements  tax returns  a statement of projected cash flows  current financial information on any guarantor and information about the collateral 
loans to closely held businesses typically require personal guarantees by the principals 
our commercial business loan portfolio is geographically dispersed across the market areas serviced by our branch network and there are no significant concentrations by industry or products 
our commercial business loans may be structured as term loans or as lines of credit 
commercial business term loans are generally made to finance the purchase of fixed assets and have maturities of five years or less 
commercial business lines of credit are typically made for the purpose of providing working capital and are usually approved with a term of one year 
adjustable or floating rate loans are primarily tied to various prime rate or libor indices 
at december   commercial business loans totaled million  or of our total loans 
agricultural lending agriculture is a major industry in many parts of our service areas 
while agricultural loans are not a large part of our portfolio  we intend to continue to make agricultural loans to borrowers with a strong capital base  sufficient management depth  proven ability to operate through agricultural cycles  reliable cash flows and adequate financial reporting 
payments on agricultural loans depend  to a large degree  on the results of operations of the related farm entity 
the repayment is also subject to other economic and weather conditions as well as market prices for agricultural products  which can be highly volatile 
at december   agricultural business loans  including collateral secured loans to purchase farm land and equipment  totaled million  or of our loan portfolio 
agricultural operating loans generally are made as a percentage of the borrower s anticipated income to support budgeted operating expenses 
these loans are secured by a blanket lien on all crops  livestock  equipment  accounts and products and proceeds thereof 
in the case of crops  consideration is given to projected yields and prices from each commodity 
the interest rate is normally floating based on the prime rate or a libor index plus a negotiated margin 
because these loans are made to finance a farm or ranch s annual operations  they are usually written on a one year review and renewable basis 
the renewal is dependent upon the prior year s performance and the forthcoming year s projections as well as the overall financial strength of the borrower 
we carefully monitor these loans and related variance reports on income and expenses compared to budget estimates 
to meet the seasonal operating needs of a farm  borrowers may qualify for single payment notes  revolving lines of credit and or non revolving lines of credit 
in underwriting agricultural operating loans  we consider the cash flow of the borrower based upon the expected operating results as well as the value of collateral used to secure the loans 
collateral generally consists of cash crops produced by the farm  such as milk  grains  fruit  grass seed  peas  sugar beets  mint  onions  potatoes  corn and alfalfa or livestock 
in addition to considering cash flow and obtaining a blanket security interest in the farm s cash crop  we may also collateralize an operating loan with the farm s operating equipment  breeding stock  real estate and federal agricultural program payments to the borrower 
we also originate loans to finance the purchase of farm equipment 
loans to purchase farm equipment are made for terms of up to seven years 
on occasion  we also originate agricultural real estate loans secured primarily by first liens on farmland and improvements thereon located in our market areas  although generally only to service the needs of our existing customers 
loans are written in amounts ranging from to of the tax assessed or appraised value of the property for terms of five to years 
these loans generally have interest rates that adjust at least every five years based upon a treasury index or fhlb advance rate plus a negotiated margin 
fixed rate loans are granted on terms usually not to exceed five years 
in originating agricultural real estate loans  we consider the debt service coverage of the borrower s cash flow  the appraised value of the underlying property  the experience and knowledge of the borrower  and the borrower s past performance with us and or the market area 
these loans normally are not made to start up businesses and are reserved for existing customers with substantial equity and a proven history 
among the more common risks to agricultural lending can be weather conditions and disease 
these risks may be mitigated through multi peril crop insurance 
commodity prices also present a risk  which may be reduced by the use of set price contracts 
normally  required beginning and projected operating margins provide for reasonable reserves to offset unexpected yield and price deficiencies 
in addition to these risks  we also consider management succession  life insurance and business continuation plans when evaluating agricultural loans 
consumer and other lending we originate a variety of consumer loans  including home equity lines of credit  automobile  boat and recreational vehicle loans and loans secured by deposit accounts 
while consumer lending has traditionally been a small part of our business  with loans made primarily to accommodate our existing customer base  it has received consistent emphasis in recent years 
part of this emphasis has been the reintroduction of a banner bank funded credit card program which we began marketing in similar to other consumer loan programs  we focus this credit card program on our existing customer base to add to the depth of our customer relationships 
in addition to earning balances  credit card accounts produce non interest revenues through interchange fees and other activity based revenues 
our underwriting of consumer loans is focused on the borrower s credit history and ability to repay the debt as evidenced by documented sources of income 
at december   we had million  or of our loans receivable  in consumer related loans  including million  or of our loans receivable  in consumer loans secured by one to four family residences 
similar to commercial business loans  our other consumer loans often entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans 
home equity lines of credit generally entail greater risk than do one to four family residential mortgage loans where we are in the first lien position 
for those home equity lines secured by a second mortgage  it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering all or a portion of our loan proceeds in the event of default unless we are prepared to repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property 
in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets such as automobiles  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage  loss or depreciation 
the remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans 
these loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a consumer loan borrower against an assignee of such loans such as us  and a borrower may be able to assert against the assignee claims and defenses that it has against the seller of the underlying collateral 
loan solicitation and processing we originate real estate loans in our market areas by direct solicitation of real estate brokers  builders  depositors  walk in customers and visitors to our internet website 
loan applications are taken by our mortgage loan officers or through our internet website and are processed in branch or regional locations 
most underwriting and loan administration functions for our real estate loans are performed by loan personnel at central locations 
we do not make loans originated by independent third party loan brokers or any similar wholesale loan origination channels 
our commercial bankers solicit commercial and agricultural business loans through call programs focused on local businesses and farmers 
while commercial bankers are delegated reasonable commitment authority based upon their qualifications  credit decisions on significant commercial and agricultural loans are made by senior loan officers or in certain instances by the board of directors of banner bank and islanders bank 
we originate consumer loans through various marketing efforts directed primarily toward our existing deposit and loan customers 
consumer loan applications are primarily underwritten and documented by centralized administrative personnel 
loan originations  sales and purchases while we originate a variety of loans  our ability to originate each type of loan is dependent upon the relative customer demand and competition in each market we serve 
for the years ended december   and  we originated loans  net of repayments  of million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in net originations for reflects a significant increase in production of one to four family residential loans  as well as increased new commercial business and agricultural business loans and commercial real estate loans  and a reduction in charge offs on problem loans 
the lower level of originations  net of repayments and charge offs  during was significantly impacted by reduced demand from creditworthy borrowers due to weak economic conditions  a substantial amount of loan repayments  and significant charge offs 
we sell many of our newly originated one to four family residential mortgage loans to secondary market purchasers as part of our interest rate risk management strategy 
originations of one to four family residential loans for sale increased to million for the year ended december  from million during proceeds from sales of loans for the years ended december   and  totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
sales of loans generally are beneficial to us because these sales may generate income at the time of sale  provide funds for additional lending and other investments  increase liquidity or reduce interest rate risk 
we sell loans on both a servicing retained and a servicing released basis 
all loans are sold without recourse 
the decision to hold or sell loans is based on asset liability management goals  strategies and policies and on market conditions 
see loan servicing 
at december   we had million in loans held for sale 
we periodically purchase whole loans and loan participation interests primarily during periods of reduced loan demand in our primary market area and at times to support our community reinvestment act lending activities 
any such purchases are made generally consistent with our underwriting standards  however  the loans may be located outside of our normal lending area 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased million  million and  respectively  of loans and loan participation interests 
loan servicing we receive fees from a variety of institutional owners in return for performing the traditional services of collecting individual payments and managing portfolios of sold loans 
at december   we were servicing billion of loans for others 
loan servicing includes processing payments  accounting for loan funds and collecting and paying real estate taxes  hazard insurance and other loan related items such as private mortgage insurance 
in addition to earning fee income  we retain certain amounts in escrow for the benefit of the lender for which we incur no interest expense but are able to invest the funds into earning assets 
at december   we held million in escrow for our portfolio of loans serviced for others 
the loan servicing portfolio at december  was composed of million of freddie mac residential mortgage loans  million of fannie mae residential mortgage loans and million of both residential and non residential mortgage loans serviced for a variety of private investors 
the portfolio included loans secured by property located primarily in the states of washington  oregon and idaho 
for the year ended december   we recognized a  gain from loan servicing in our results of operations  which was net of million of servicing rights amortization and a  impairment charge for a valuation adjustment to mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights we record mortgage servicing rights msrs with respect to loans we originate and sell in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis 
the value of msrs is capitalized and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized million  million  and million  respectively  of msrs relating to loans sold with servicing retained 
no msrs were purchased in those periods 
amortization of msrs for the years ended december   and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the carrying values of msrs and the amortization of msrs 
these carrying values are adjusted when the valuation indicates the carrying value is impaired 
during  we recorded a  impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our msrs 
msrs generally are adversely affected by higher levels of current or anticipated prepayments resulting from decreasing interest rates 
at december   our msrs were carried at a value of million  net of amortization 
asset quality classified assets state and federal regulations require that the banks review and classify their problem assets on a regular basis 
in addition  in connection with examinations of insured institutions  state and federal examiners have authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
historically  we have not had any meaningful differences of opinion with the examiners with respect to asset classification 
banner bank s credit policy division reviews detailed information with respect to the composition and performance of the loan portfolios  including information on risk concentrations  delinquencies and classified assets for both banner bank and islanders bank 
the credit policy division approves all recommendations for new classified loans or  in the case of smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential real estate and consumer loans  it has approved policies governing such classifications  or changes in classifications  and develops and monitors action plans to resolve the problems associated with the assets 
the credit policy division also approves recommendations for establishing the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
significant problem loans are transferred to banner bank s special assets department for resolution or collection activities 
the banks and banner corporation s boards of directors are given a detailed report on classified assets and asset quality at least quarterly 
for additional information regarding asset quality and non performing loans  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and asset quality  and tables  and contained therein 
allowance for loan losses in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the security for the loan 
as a result  we maintain an allowance for loan losses consistent with gaap guidelines 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for possible loan losses against our income 
the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is sufficient to provide for probable losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
at december   we had an allowance for loan losses of million  which represented of loans and of non performing loans compared to and  respectively  at december  for additional information concerning our allowance for loan losses  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and provision and allowance for loan losses  and tables and contained therein 
real estate owned real estate owned reo is property acquired by foreclosure or receiving a deed in lieu of foreclosure  and is recorded at the lower of the estimated fair value of the property  less expected selling costs  or the carrying amount of the defaulted loan 
development and improvement costs relating to the property are capitalized to the extent they add value to the property 
the carrying value of the property is periodically evaluated by management and  if necessary  allowances are established to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value 
gains or losses at the time the property is sold are credited or charged to operations in the period in which they are realized 
the amounts we will ultimately recover from reo may differ substantially from the carrying value of the assets because of market factors beyond our control or because of changes in our strategies for recovering the investment 
if the book value of the reo is determined to be in excess of the fair market value  a valuation allowance is recognized against earnings 
at december   we had reo of million  compared to million at december  valuation allowances recognized during were million and for both and valuation charges were million 
for additional information on reo  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and asset quality and table contained therein and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

our policies generally limit investments to us government and agency including government sponsored entities securities  municipal bonds  certificates of deposit  corporate debt obligations and mortgage backed securities 
investment in mortgage backed securities may include those issued or guaranteed by freddie mac  fannie mae  government national mortgage association ginnie mae or gnma and privately issued mortgage backed securities that have an aa credit rating or higher at the time of purchase  as well as collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
a high credit rating indicates only that the rating agency believes there is a low risk of loss or default 
to the best of our knowledge  we do not have any investments in mortgage backed securities  collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles that have a material exposure to sub prime mortgages 
however  we do have investments in single issuer trust preferred securities and collateralized debt obligations secured by pooled trust preferred securities that have been materially adversely impacted by concerns related to the banking and insurance industries as well as payment deferrals and defaults by certain issuers 
further  all of our investment securities  including those that have high credit ratings  are subject to market risk in so far as a change in market rates of interest or other conditions may cause a change in an investment s earnings performance and or market value 
at december   our consolidated investment portfolio totaled million and consisted principally of us government agency obligations  mortgage backed securities  municipal bonds  corporate debt obligations  and asset backed securities secured by student loans issued or guaranteed by the student loan marketing association 
from time to time  investment levels may be increased or decreased depending upon yields available on investment alternatives and management s projections as to the demand for funds to be used in loan originations  deposits and other activities 
during the year ended december   holdings of mortgage backed securities increased million to million  while treasury and agency obligations decreased million to million  corporate securities including equities increased million to million  municipal bonds increased million to million  and new investments in asset backed securities were million

off balance sheet derivatives derivatives include off balance sheet financial products  the value of which is dependent on the value of underlying financial assets  such as stock  bonds  foreign currency  or a reference rate or index 
such derivatives include forwards  futures  options or swaps 
as a result of the acquisition of f m bank  we became a party to approximately million million as of december  in notional amounts of interest rate swaps 
these swaps serve as hedges to an equal amount of fixed rate loans which include market value prepayment penalties that mirror the provision of the specifically matched interest rate swaps 
in addition  in we began actively marketing interest rate swaps to certain loan customers in connection with longer term floating rate loans  allowing them to effectively fix their loan interest rates 
these customer swaps are matched with third party swaps with qualified broker dealers or banks to offset the risk 
as of december   we had million in notional amounts of these customer interest rate swaps outstanding  with an equal amount of offsetting third party swaps also in place 
the fair value adjustments for these swaps and the related loans are reflected in other assets or other liabilities as appropriate  and in the carrying value of the hedged loans 
also  as a part of mortgage banking activities  we issue rate lock commitments to borrowers and obtain offsetting best efforts delivery commitments from purchasers of loans 
while not providing any trading or net settlement mechanisms  these off balance sheet commitments do have many of the prescribed characteristics of derivatives and as a result are accounted for as such 
accordingly  on december   we recorded an asset of  and a liability of  representing the estimated market value of those commitments 
further  in we began using forward contracts for the sale of mortgage backed securities and mandatory delivery commitments for the sale of loans to partially hedge rate lock commitments and closed loans to borrowers in our mortgage banking activities 
on december   we recorded an asset of  and a liability of  representing the estimated market value of those commitments 
these forward contracts and mandatory delivery commitments  as well as the related rate lock commitments and loans  are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
on december   we had no other investment related off balance sheet derivatives 
deposit activities and other sources of funds general deposits  fhlb advances or other borrowings and loan repayments are our major sources of funds for lending and other investment purposes 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced by general economic  interest rate and money market conditions and may vary significantly 
borrowings may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis for general business purposes  including funding loans and investments 
we compete with other financial institutions and financial intermediaries in attracting deposits 
there is strong competition for transaction balances and savings deposits from commercial banks  credit unions and non bank corporations  such as securities brokerage companies  mutual funds and other diversified companies  some of which have nationwide networks of offices 
much of the focus of our branch expansion  relocations and renovation and advertising and marketing campaigns has been directed toward attracting additional deposit customer relationships and balances 
in addition  our electronic banking activities including debit card and automated teller machine atm programs  on line internet banking services and  most recently  customer remote deposit and mobile banking capabilities are all directed at providing products and services that enhance customer relationships and result in growing deposit balances 
growing core deposits transaction and savings accounts is a fundamental element of our business strategy 
deposit accounts we generally attract deposits from within our primary market areas by offering a broad selection of deposit instruments  including demand checking accounts  interest bearing checking accounts  money market deposit accounts  regular savings accounts  certificates of deposit  cash management services and retirement savings plans 
deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate  among other factors 
in determining the terms of deposit accounts  we consider current market interest rates  profitability to us  matching deposit and loan products and customer preferences and concerns 
at december   we had billion of deposits  including billion of transaction and savings accounts and billion in time deposits 
for additional information concerning our deposit accounts  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and deposit accounts 
see also table contained therein  which sets forth the balances of deposits in the various types of accounts  and table  which sets forth the amount of our certificates of deposit greater than  by time remaining until maturity as of december  in addition  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
borrowings while deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes  we also use borrowings to supplement our supply of lendable funds  to meet deposit withdrawal requirements and to more efficiently leverage our capital position 
the fhlb seattle serves as our primary borrowing source  although in recent years we have significantly reduced our use of fhlb advances 
the fhlb seattle provides credit for member financial institutions such as banner bank and islanders bank 
as members  the banks are required to own capital stock in the fhlb seattle and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of that stock and certain of their mortgage loans and securities provided certain credit worthiness standards have been met 
limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution  the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit  and fhlb stock ownership requirements 
at december   we had million of borrowings from the fhlb seattle 
at that date  banner bank had been authorized by the fhlb seattle to borrow up to million under a blanket floating lien security agreement  while islanders bank was approved to borrow up to million under a similar agreement 
the federal reserve bank also serves as an important source of borrowing capacity 
the federal reserve bank provides credit based upon acceptable loan collateral  which includes certain loan types not eligible for pledging to the fhlb seattle 
at december   based upon our available unencumbered collateral  banner bank was eligible to borrow million from the federal reserve bank  although at that date we had no funds borrowed under this arrangement 
although eligible to participate  islanders bank has not applied for approval to borrow from the federal reserve bank 
for additional information concerning our borrowings  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition comparison of financial condition at december  and borrowings  table contained therein  and notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we issue retail repurchase agreements  generally due within days  as an additional source of funds  primarily in connection with cash management services provided to our larger deposit customers 
at december   we had issued retail repurchase agreements totaling million  which were secured by a pledge of certain us government and agency notes and mortgage backed securities with a market value of million 
we also may borrow funds through the use of secured wholesale repurchase agreements with securities brokers  however  during the three years ended december   we did not have any wholesale repurchase borrowings 
on march   banner bank completed an offering of million of qualifying senior bank notes that were guaranteed by the fdic under the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
this debt  which was issued to strengthen our overall liquidity position as we adjusted to a lower level of public funds deposits  matured and was repaid on march we have also issued million of junior subordinated debentures in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities tps 
the tps were issued from through by special purpose business trusts formed by banner corporation and were sold in private offerings to pooled investment vehicles 
the junior subordinated debentures associated with the tps have been recorded as liabilities and are reported at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
all of the debentures issued to the trusts  measured at their fair value  less the common stock of the trusts  qualified as tier i capital as of december   under guidance issued by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
we have invested substantially all of the proceeds from the issuance of the tps as additional paid in capital at banner bank 
for additional information about deposits and other sources of funds  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  and notes   and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
personnel as of december   we had  full time and part time employees 
banner corporation has no employees except for those who are also employees of banner bank  its subsidiaries  and islanders bank 
the employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
taxation federal taxation general for tax reporting purposes  we report our income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting on a consolidated basis 
we are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including particularly the reserve for bad debts 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the income taxes payable by us 
state taxation washington taxation we are subject to a business and occupation b o tax which is imposed under washington law at the rate of of gross receipts 
for many years  this rate had been 
however  on april   the washington state legislature passed a law that temporarily increased this rate to 
this new higher rate will be in effect for the period may  through june  interest received on loans secured by mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties  residential mortgage backed securities  and certain us government and agency securities is not subject to this tax 
our b o tax expense was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
oregon and idaho taxation corporations with nexus in the states of oregon and idaho are subject to a corporate level income tax 
our operations in those states resulted in corporate income taxes of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as our operations in these states increase  the state income tax provision will have an increasing effect on our effective tax rate and results of operations 
competition we encounter significant competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans 
our most direct competition for deposits comes from other commercial and savings banks  savings associations and credit unions with offices in our market areas 
we also experience competition from securities firms  insurance companies  money market and mutual funds  and other investment vehicles 
we expect continued strong competition from such financial institutions and investment vehicles in the foreseeable future  including competition from on line internet banking competitors 
our ability to attract and retain deposits depends on our ability to provide transaction services and investment opportunities that satisfy the requirements of depositors 
we compete for deposits by offering a variety of accounts and financial services  including robust electronic banking capabilities  with competitive rates and terms  at convenient locations and business hours  and delivered with a high level of personal service and expertise 
competition for loans comes principally from other commercial banks  loan brokers  mortgage banking companies  savings banks and credit unions and for agricultural loans from the farm credit administration 
the competition for loans is intense as a result of the large number of institutions competing in our market areas 
we compete for loans primarily by offering competitive rates and fees and providing timely decisions and excellent service to borrowers 
regulation banner bank and islanders bank general as state chartered  federally insured commercial banks  banner bank and islanders bank the banks are subject to extensive regulation and must comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements  including prescribed minimum capital standards 
the banks are regularly examined by the fdic and state banking regulators and file periodic reports concerning their activities and financial condition with these banking regulators 
the banks relationship with depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal and state law  especially in such matters as the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of mortgage and other loan documents 
federal and state banking laws and regulations govern all areas of the operation of the banks  including reserves  loans  investments  deposits  capital  issuance of securities  payment of dividends and establishment of branches 
federal and state bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks and bank holding companies if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice 
the respective primary federal regulators of banner corporation  banner bank and islanders bank have authority to impose penalties  initiate civil and administrative actions and take other steps intended to prevent banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices 
state regulation and supervision as a washington state chartered commercial bank with branches in the states of washington  oregon and idaho  banner bank is subject to the applicable provisions of washington  oregon and idaho law and regulations 
state law and regulations govern banner bank ability to take deposits and pay interest thereon  to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate  to make consumer loans  to invest in securities  to offer various banking services to its customers and to establish branch offices 
in a similar fashion  washington state laws and regulations for state chartered commercial banks also apply to islanders bank 
deposit insurance the deposit insurance fund dif of the fdic insures deposit accounts of the banks up to  per separately insured depositor 
as insurer  the fdic imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of  and to require reporting by  fdic insured institutions 
banner bank and islanders bank deposit insurance premiums expense for the year ended december   were million and  respectively 
as a result of a decline in the reserve ratio the ratio of the net worth of the dif to estimated insured deposits and concerns about expected failure costs and available liquid assets in the dif  the fdic adopted a rule requiring each insured institution to prepay on december  the estimated amount of its quarterly assessments for the fourth quarter of and all quarters through the end of in addition to the regular quarterly assessment for the third quarter which was due on december  
the prepaid amount is recorded as an asset with a zero risk weight and the institution will continue to record quarterly expenses for deposit insurance 
for purposes of calculating the prepaid amount  assessments were measured at the institution assessment rate as of september   with a uniform increase of three basis points effective january   and were based on the institution assessment base for the third quarter of  with growth assumed quarterly at annual rate of 
if events cause actual assessments during the prepayment period to vary from the prepaid amount  institutions will pay excess assessments in cash or receive a rebate of prepaid amounts not exhausted after collection of assessments due on june   as applicable 
collection of the prepayment does not preclude the fdic from changing assessment rates or revising the risk based assessment system in the future 
the balance of our prepaid assessment was million at december  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act requires the fdic deposit insurance assessments to be based on assets instead of deposits 
the fdic has issued rules  effective as of the second quarter of  which specify that the assessment base for a bank is equal to its total average consolidated assets less average tangible capital 
the fdic assessment rates range from approximately five basis points to basis points  depending on applicable adjustments for unsecured debt issued by an institution and brokered deposits and to further adjustment for institutions that hold unsecured debt of other fdic insured institutions  until such time as the fdic reserve ratio equals 
once the fdic reserve ratio reaches and the reserve ratio for the immediately prior assessment period is less than  the applicable assessment rates may range from three basis points to basis points subject to adjustments as described above 
if the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is equal to  or greater than and less than  the assessment rates may range from two basis points to basis points and if the prior assessment period is greater than  the assessment rates may range from one basis point to basis points in each case subject to adjustments as described above 
no institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment 
the fdic conducts examinations of and requires reporting by state non member banks  such as the banks 
the fdic also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the deposit insurance fund 
the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the fdic 
it also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital 
if insurance of accounts is terminated  the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination  less subsequent withdrawals  shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years  as determined by the fdic 
management is not aware of any existing circumstances which would result in termination of the deposit insurance of either banner bank or islanders bank 
prompt corrective action federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
an institution category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures  which include a risk based capital measure  a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework 
under these regulations  an institution is treated as well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to total assets leverage ratio is or more  and it is not subject to any federal supervisory order or directive to meet a specific capital level 
in order to be adequately capitalized  an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of not less than  a core capital to risk weighted assets ratio of not less than  and a leverage ratio of not less than 
an institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits  including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits generally 
any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized 
undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements  regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized 
failure by either banner bank and islanders bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would  if unremedied  result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions  including  but not limited to  the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and  ultimately  the appointment of the fdic as receiver or conservator 
banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
additionally  approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements 
at december   both banner bank and islanders bank were categorized as well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations of the fdic 
for additional information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
standards for safety and soundness the federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed  by regulation  guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings  and compensation  fees and benefits 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative  technical  and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities 
the information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information  protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer  and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information 
each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems 
if the fdic determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines  it may require an institution to submit to the fdic an acceptable plan to achieve compliance 
capital requirements federally insured financial institutions  such as banner bank and islanders bank  are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital 
fdic regulations recognize two types  or tiers  of capital core tier capital and supplementary tier capital 
tier capital generally includes common stockholders equity  qualifying restricted core capital elements other than cumulative perpetual preferred stock  less deductions for disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets 
tier capital  which recognizes up to of tier capital for risk based capital purposes includes such items as qualifying general loan loss reserves up to of risk weighted assets  qualified subordinated debt  redeemable preferred stock  other restricted core capital elements  cumulative perpetual preferred stock  and net unrealized holding gains on equity securities subject to certain limitations  provided  however  the amount of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock that may be included in tier capital for risk based capital purposes is limited to of tier capital 
the fdic currently measures an institution capital using a leverage limit together with certain risk based ratios 
the fdic minimum leverage capital requirement specifies a minimum ratio of tier capital to average total assets 
most banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of at least to of total assets 
at december   banner bank and islanders bank had tier leverage capital ratios of and  respectively 
the fdic retains the right to require an institution to maintain a higher capital level based on an institution particular risk profile 
fdic regulations also establish a measure of capital adequacy based on ratios of qualifying capital to risk weighted assets 
assets are placed in one of four categories and given a percentage weight based on the relative risk of the category 
in addition  certain off balance sheet items are converted to balance sheet credit equivalent amounts  and each amount is then assigned to one of the four categories 
under the guidelines  the ratio of total capital tier capital plus tier capital to risk weighted assets must be at least  and the ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets must be at least 
in evaluating the adequacy of a bank capital  the fdic may also consider other factors that may affect the bank financial condition 
such factors may include interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  the quality and level of earnings  concentration of credit risk  risks arising from nontraditional activities  loan and investment quality  the effectiveness of loan and investment policies  and management ability to monitor and control financial operating risks 
at december   banner bank and islanders bank had tier risk based capital ratios of and  respectively  and total risk based capital ratios of and  respectively 
fdic capital requirements are designated as the minimum acceptable standards for banks whose overall financial condition is fundamentally sound  which are well managed and have no material or significant financial weaknesses 
the fdic capital regulations state that  where the fdic determines that the financial history or condition  including off balance sheet risk  managerial resources and or the future earnings prospects of a bank are not adequate and or a bank has a significant volume of assets classified substandard  doubtful or loss or otherwise criticized  the fdic may determine that the minimum adequate amount of capital for the bank is greater than the minimum standards established in the regulation 
we believe that  under the current regulations  banner bank and islanders bank exceed their minimum capital requirements 
however  events beyond the control of the banks  such as weak or depressed economic conditions in areas where they have most of their loans  could adversely affect future earnings and  consequently  the ability of the banks to meet their capital requirements 
for additional information concerning banner bank and islanders bank capital  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
new proposed capital rules 
in june  the federal reserve  fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency occ approved proposed rules that would substantially amend the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to banner corporation and the banks 
the proposed rules implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the dodd frank act 
basel iii refers to various documents released by the basel committee on banking supervision 
the proposed rules were subject to a public comment period that has expired and there is no date set for the adoption of final rules 
the proposed rules include new minimum risk based capital and leverage ratios  which would be phased in during and  and would refine the definitions of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios 
the proposed new minimum capital level requirements applicable to banner corporation and the banks under the proposals would be i a new common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of increased from  iii a total capital ratio of unchanged from current rules  and iv a tier leverage ratio of 
the proposed rules would also establish a capital conservation buffer of above each of the new regulatory minimum capital ratios which would result in the following minimum ratios i a common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of  and iii a total capital ratio of 
the new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in january at of risk weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in january an institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends  engaging in share repurchases  and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount 
these limitations would establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions 
the proposed rules also implement other revisions to the current capital rules such as recognition of all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities  and provide that instruments that will no longer qualify as capital would be phased out over time 
the federal bank regulatory agencies also proposed revisions to the prompt corrective action framework  which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions  including the banks  if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness 
these revisions would take effect january  under the prompt corrective action requirements  insured depository institutions would be required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as well capitalized i a new common equity tier risk based capital ratio of  ii a tier risk based capital ratio of increased from  iii a total risk based capital ratio of unchanged from current rules  and iv a tier leverage ratio of unchanged from the current rules 
the proposed rules set forth certain changes for the calculation of risk weighted assets and utilize an increased number of credit risk and other exposure categories and risk weights 
in addition  the proposed rules also address i a proposed alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with section a of the dodd frank act  ii revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation  iii rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans  and iv revised capital treatment for derivatives and repurchase style transactions 
in particular  the proposed rules would expand the risk weighting categories from the current four categories   and to a much larger and more risk sensitive number of categories  generally ranging from for us government and agency securities  to for certain equity exposures 
higher risk weights would apply to a variety of exposure categories 
specifics include  among others applying a risk weight instead of a risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition  development and construction loans 
for residential mortgage exposures  the current approach of a risk weight for high quality seasoned mortgages and a risk weight for all other mortgages is replaced with a risk weight of between and depending upon the mortgage loan to value ratio and whether the mortgage is a category or category residential mortgage exposure based on eight criteria that include  among others  the term  seniority of the lien  use of negative amortization  balloon payments and certain rate increases 
assigning a risk weight to exposures other than residential mortgage exposures that are days past due 
providing for a credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable currently set at 
providing for a risk weight for claims on securities firms 
eliminating the current cap on the risk weight for otc derivatives 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act imposes new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions  including depository institutions 
the following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the dodd frank act that may affect the banks and banner corporation 
for certain of these changes  implementing regulations have not been promulgated  so we cannot determine the full impact of the dodd frank act on our business and operations at this time 
the following aspects of the dodd frank act are related to the operations of the banks the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb  an independent consumer compliance regulatory agency within the federal reserve has been established 
the cfpb is empowered to exercise broad regulatory  supervisory and enforcement authority over financial institutions with total assets of over billion with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws 
financial institutions with assets of less than billion  like the banks  will continue to be subject to supervision and enforcement by their primary federal banking regulator with respect to federal consumer financial protection laws 
the cfpb also has authority to promulgate new consumer financial protection regulations and amend existing consumer financial protection regulations  the federal deposit insurance act was amended to direct federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries  the prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed  effective july   deposit insurance is permanently increased to  the deposit insurance assessment base for fdic insurance is the depository institution average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity during the assessment period  and the minimum reserve ratio of the fdic dif increased to percent of estimated annual insured deposits or the comparable percentage of the assessment base  however  the fdic is directed to offset the effect of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than billion 
pursuant to the dodd frank act  the fdic recently issued a rule setting a designated reserve ratio at of insured deposits 
the following aspects of the dodd frank act are related to the operations of banner corporation tier capital treatment for hybrid capital items like trust preferred securities is eliminated subject to various grandfathering and transition rules 
the federal banking agencies must promulgate new rules on regulatory capital within months from july   for both depository institutions and their holding companies  to include leverage capital and risk based capital measures at least as stringent as those now applicable to the banks under the prompt corrective action regulations  public companies are required to provide their shareholders with a non binding vote i at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers  and ii at least once every six years on whether they should have a say on pay vote every one  two or three years  a separate  non binding shareholder vote is required regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers  acquisitions  dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments  securities exchanges are required to prohibit brokers from using their own discretion to vote shares not beneficially owned by them for certain significant matters  which include votes on the election of directors  executive compensation matters  and any other matter determined to be significant  stock exchanges are prohibited from listing the securities of any issuer that does not have a policy providing for i disclosure of its policy on incentive compensation payable on the basis of financial information reportable under the securities laws  and ii the recovery from current or former executive officers  following an accounting restatement triggered by material noncompliance with securities law reporting requirements  of any incentive compensation paid erroneously during the three year period preceding the date on which the restatement was required that exceeds the amount that would have been paid on the basis of the restated financial information  disclosure in annual proxy materials is required concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer  item of regulation s k is amended to require companies to disclose the ratio of the chief executive officer annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees  and smaller reporting companies are exempt from complying with the internal control auditor attestation requirements of section b of the sarbanes oxley act 
commercial real estate lending concentrations the federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution 
the purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations 
the guidance directs the fdic and other bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk 
a bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending  has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan  or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk total reported loans for construction  land development and other land represent or more of the bank capital  or total commercial real estate loans as defined in the guidance represent or more of the bank total capital or the outstanding balance of the bank commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased or more during the prior months 
the guidance provides that the strength of an institution lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy 
as of december   banner bank and islanders bank aggregate loans for construction  land development and land loans were and of total capital  respectively 
in addition  at december  banner bank and islanders bank loans on commercial real estate were and of total capital  respectively 
activities and investments of insured state chartered financial institutions federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of fdic insured  state chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks 
an insured state bank is not prohibited from  among other things  acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary  investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition  rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project  provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed of the bank total assets  acquiring up to of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or re insures directors  trustees and officers liability insurance coverage or bankers blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions  and acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met 
washington state has enacted a law regarding financial institution parity 
primarily  the law affords washington chartered commercial banks the same powers as washington chartered savings banks 
in order for a bank to exercise these powers  it must provide days notice to the director of the washington department of financial institutions and the director must authorize the requested activity 
in addition  the law provides that washington chartered commercial banks may exercise any of the powers that the federal reserve has determined to be closely related to the business of banking and the powers of national banks  subject to the approval of the director in certain situations 
the law also provides that washington chartered savings banks may exercise any of the powers of washington chartered commercial banks  national banks and federally chartered savings banks  subject to the approval of the director in certain situations

environmental issues associated with real estate lending the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present owners and operators of sites containing hazardous waste 
however  congress asked to protect secured creditors by providing that the term owner and operator excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site 
since the enactment of the cercla  this secured creditor exemption has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan 
to the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area  all creditors  including banner bank and islanders bank  that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination such as petroleum contamination could be subject to liability for cleanup costs  which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property

nor may the federal reserve approve an application if the applicant and its depository institution affiliates controls or would control more than of the insured deposits in the united states or or more of the deposits in the target bank home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch 
federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out of state banks or bank holding companies 
individual states may also waive the state wide concentration limit contained in the federal law 
the federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the law of any state  unless the home state of one of the banks adopted a law prior to june  which applies equally to all out of state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out of state banks

dividends the federal reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies  which expresses its view that although there are no specific regulations restricting dividend payments by bank holding companies other than state corporate laws  a bank holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company net income for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
capital requirements the federal reserve has established capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies that generally parallel the capital requirements of the fdic for the banks  although the federal reserve regulations provide for the inclusion of certain trust preferred securities for up to of tier capital in determining compliance with the guidelines 
the federal reserve regulations provide that capital standards will be applied on a consolidated basis in the case of a bank holding company with million or more in total consolidated assets 
the guidelines require that a company total risk based capital must equal of risk weighted assets and one half of the must consist of tier core capital 
as of december   banner corporation total risk based capital was of risk weighted assets and its tier core capital was of risk weighted assets 
the dodd frank act required new capital regulations to be adopted in final form months after the july  enactment date of the dodd frank act 
in june  the federal reserve  fdic and the occ approved proposed rules that would substantially amend the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to banner corporation and the banks 
the proposed rules were subject to a public comment period that has expired and there is no date set for the adoption of final rules 
stock repurchases a bank holding company  except for certain well capitalized and highly rated bank holding companies  is required to give the federal reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months  is equal to or more of its consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law  regulation  federal reserve order or any condition imposed by  or written agreement with  the federal reserve

item a risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties described below  other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  capital levels  cash flows  liquidity  results of operations and prospects 
the market price of our common stock could decline significantly due to any of these identified or other risks  and you could lose some or all of your investment 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
risks factors related to our business our business may continue to be adversely affected by downturns in the national economy and the regional economies on which we depend 
our operations are significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions 
weakness in the national economy or the economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
substantially all of our loans are to businesses and individuals in the states of washington  oregon and idaho 
all of our branches and most of our deposit customers are also located in these three states 
beginning in  washington  oregon and idaho have experienced significant home price declines  increased foreclosures and high unemployment rates  and each state continues to face fiscal challenges  which may have adverse long term effects on economic conditions in those states 
as a result of the high concentration of our customer base in the puget sound area of washington state  the deterioration of businesses in the puget sound area  or one or more businesses with a large employee base in that area  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity  results of operations and prospects 
in addition  weakness in the global economy has adversely affected many businesses operating in our markets that are dependent upon international trade 
a further deterioration in economic conditions or a prolonged delay in economic recovery in the market areas we serve  in particular the puget sound area of washington state  the portland  oregon metropolitan area  spokane  washington  boise  idaho and the agricultural regions of the columbia basin  could result in the following consequences  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations demand for our products and services may decline  loan delinquencies  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  collateral for loans  especially real estate  may decline further in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power  reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans  and the amount of our low cost or non interest bearing deposits may decrease 
a return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of non performing loans and or reduce demand for our products and services  which could have adverse effect on our results of operations 
the ongoing debate in congress regarding the national debt ceiling and federal budget deficit and concerns over the united states credit rating which was downgraded by standard poor  the european sovereign debt crisis  the overall weakness in the economy and continued high unemployment in the united states  among other economic indicators  have contributed to increased volatility in the capital markets and diminished expectations for the economy 
a return of recessionary conditions and or continued negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the value of our loans and investments  and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
further declines in real estate values and sales volumes and continued high unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services 
these negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital  liquidity  and financial condition 
furthermore  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  in an attempt to help the overall economy  has  among other things  kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of us treasury and mortgage backed securities 
if the federal reserve increases the federal funds rate  overall interest rates will likely rise  which may negatively impact the housing markets and the us economic recovery 
in addition  deflationary pressures  while possibly lowering our operating costs  could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers  especially our business borrowers  and the values of underlying collateral securing loans  which could negatively affect our financial performance 
declines in property value have increased the loan to value ratios on a significant portion of our residential mortgage loan portfolio  which exposes us to greater risk of loss 
many of our residential mortgage loans are secured by liens on mortgage properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity because either we originated the loan with a relatively high combined loan to value ratio or because of the decline in home values in our market areas 
residential loans with high combined loan to value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan to value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses 
in addition  if the borrowers sell their homes  such borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds 
as a result  these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies  defaults and losses 
our loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss 
we originate construction and land loans  commercial and multifamily mortgage loans  commercial business loans  consumer loans  agricultural mortgage loans and agricultural loans primarily within our market areas 
we had billion outstanding in these types of higher risk loans at december  compared to billion at december  these loans typically present different risks to us for a number of reasons  including those discussed below construction and land loans 
at december   construction and land loans were million or of our total loan portfolio 
this type of lending contains the inherent difficulty in estimating both a property s value at completion of the project and the estimated cost including interest of the project 
if the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate  we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project 
if the estimate of value upon completion proves to be inaccurate  we may be confronted at  or prior to  the maturity of the loan with a project the value of which is insufficient to assure full repayment 
in addition  speculative construction loans to a builder are often associated with homes that are not pre sold  and thus pose a greater potential risk to us than construction loans to individuals on their personal residences 
loans on land under development or held for future construction also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral 
these risks can be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions 
as a result  this type of lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell the property  rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to independently repay principal and interest 
while our origination of these types of loans has decreased significantly in the last five years  we continue to have significant levels of construction and land loan balances 
at december   construction and land loans that were non performing were million  or of our total non performing loans 
commercial and multifamily real estate loans 
at december   commercial and multifamily real estate loans were billion  or of our total loan portfolio 
these loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans 
repayment is dependent upon income being generated from the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service  which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions 
in addition  many of our commercial and multifamily real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity 
such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment  which may increase the risk of default or non payment 
this risk is exacerbated in the current economic environment 
at december   commercial and multifamily real estate loans that were non performing were million  or of our total non performing loans 
commercial business loans 
at december   commercial business loans were million  or of our total loan portfolio 
our commercial loans are primarily made based on the cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
the borrowers cash flow may be unpredictable  and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value 
most often  this collateral is accounts receivable  inventory  equipment or real estate 
in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers 
other collateral securing loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise  may be illiquid and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
at december   commercial business loans that were non performing were million  or of our total non performing loans 
agricultural loans 
at december   agricultural loans were million  or of our total loan portfolio 
repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business  which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either us or the borrowers 
these factors include weather  commodity prices  and interest rates among others 
collateral securing these loans may be difficult to evaluate  manage or liquidate and may not provide an adequate source of repayment 
at december   there were no agricultural loans that were non performing 
consumer loans 
at december   consumer loans were million  or of our total loan portfolio 
consumer loans such as personal lines of credit are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation  damage  or loss 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss  divorce  illness or personal bankruptcy 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
at december   consumer loans that were non performing were million  or of our total non performing loans 
if our allowance for loan losses is not adequate  we may be required to make further increases in our provisions for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for loan losses of million  compared to million for the year ended december  we also recorded net loan charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  despite the decrease from the prior year  we are still experiencing elevated levels of loan delinquencies and credit losses by historical standards 
at december   our total non performing loans had decreased to million compared to million at december  if current weak conditions in the housing and real estate markets continue  we expect that we will continue to experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses 
moreover  if weak economic conditions in our market areas persist  we could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses 
as a result  we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio which would cause our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition to be adversely affected 
lending money is a substantial part of our business and each loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment 
this risk is affected by  among other things cash flow of the borrower and or the project being financed  in the case of a collateralized loan  the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral  the duration of the loan  the character and creditworthiness of a particular borrower  and changes in economic and industry conditions 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  which we believe is appropriate to provide for probable losses in our loan portfolio 
the amount of this allowance is determined by our management through periodic reviews and consideration of several factors  including  but not limited to our general reserve  based on our historical default and loss experience  certain macroeconomic factors  and management s expectations of future events  our specific reserve  based on our evaluation of non performing loans and their underlying collateral  and an unallocated reserve to provide for other credit losses inherent in our portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the other loss factors 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we review our loans and loss and delinquency experience  and evaluate economic conditions and make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
if our estimates are incorrect  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  resulting in the need for additions to our allowance through an increase in the provision for loan losses 
continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses was of total loans outstanding and of non performing loans at december  in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses 
any increases in the provision for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and capital 
if our non performing assets increase  our earnings will be adversely affected 
at december  and  our non performing assets which consist of nonaccruing loans  accruing loans days or more past due  non performing investment securities  and real estate owned reo were million and million  respectively  or and of total assets  respectively 
our non performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways we do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans  non performing investment securities  or reo 
we must provide for probable loan losses through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses 
non interest expense increases when we must write down the value of properties in our reo portfolio to reflect changing market values or recognize other than temporary impairment on non performing investment securities 
there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets  as well as carrying costs  such as taxes  insurance  and maintenance fees related to our reo 
the resolution of non performing assets requires the active involvement of management  which can distract them from more profitable activity 
if additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our non performing assets  our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
our growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high 
we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we may at some point  however  need to raise additional capital to support continued growth or be required by our regulators to increase our capital resources 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial condition and performance 
accordingly  we cannot make assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by our bank regulators  we may be subject to adverse regulatory action 
we may have significant variation in our annual and quarterly results 
we reported net income of million available to common shareholders during the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million during the year ended december  our operating results in recent periods have been significantly influenced by the relatively high  although declining  levels of delinquencies  non performing loans  and related provision for loan losses  net loan charge offs and charges related to reo 
in addition  several other factors affecting our business can cause significant variations in our quarterly results of operations 
in particular  variations in the volume of our loan originations and sales  the differences between our cost of funds and the average interest rate earned on investments  special fdic insurance charges  significant changes in real estate valuations and the fair valuation of our junior subordinated debentures or our investment securities portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
if our investments in real estate are not properly valued or sufficiently reserved to cover actual losses  or if we are required to increase our valuation reserves  our earnings could be reduced 
we obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and broker price opinions when a loan has been foreclosed and the property taken in as reo and at certain other times during the assets holding period 
our net book value nbv in the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated market value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs fair value 
a charge off is recorded for any excess in the asset s nbv over its fair value 
if our valuation process is incorrect  or if property values decline  the fair value of the investments in real estate may not be sufficient to recover our carrying value in such assets  resulting in the need for additional charge offs 
significant charge offs to our investments in real estate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our reo and may require us to recognize further charge offs 
any increase in our charge offs  as required by the bank regulators  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the value of securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in securities markets 
the market for some of the investment securities held in our portfolio has been generally disrupted  uncertain and inefficient in recent years 
these market conditions have affected and may further detrimentally affect the value of these securities  such as through reduced valuations because of the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks 
there can be no assurance that the declines in market value associated with this disruption and lack of activity will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets  which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels 
an increase in interest rates  change in the programs offered by secondary market purchasers or our ability to qualify for their programs may reduce our mortgage banking revenues  which would negatively impact our non interest income 
our mortgage banking operations provide a significant portion of our non interest income 
we generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of single family mortgage loans pursuant to programs currently offered by fannie mae  freddie mac  ginnie mae and non gse investors 
these entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans 
any future changes in these programs  our eligibility to participate in such programs  the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could  in turn  materially adversely affect our results of operations 
mortgage banking is generally considered a volatile source of income because it depends largely on the level of loan volume which  in turn  depends largely on prevailing market interest rates 
in a rising or higher interest rate environment  our originations of mortgage loans may decrease  resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors 
this would result in a decrease in mortgage banking revenues and a corresponding decrease in non interest income 
in addition  our results of operations are affected by the amount of non interest expense associated with mortgage banking activities  such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs 
during periods of reduced loan demand  our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations 
in addition  although we sell loans into the secondary market without recourse  we are required to give customary representations and warranties about the loans to the buyers 
if we breach those representations and warranties  the buyers may require us to repurchase the loans and we may incur a loss on the repurchase 
our results of operations  liquidity and cash flows are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but these changes could also affect i our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and iii the average duration of our mortgage backed securities portfolio and other interest earning assets 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
in addition  a substantial amount of our loans have adjustable interest rates 
as a result  these loans may experience a higher rate of default in a rising interest rate environment 
further  a significant portion of our adjustable rate loans have interest rate floors below which the loan s contractual interest rate may not adjust 
approximately of our loan portfolio was comprised of adjustable or floating rate loans at december   and approximately billion  or  of those loans contained interest rate floors  below which the loans contractual interest rate may not adjust 
at december   the weighted average floor interest rate of these loans was 
at that date  approximately billion  or  of these loans were at their floor interest rate 
the inability of our loans to adjust downward can contribute to increased income in periods of declining interest rates  although this result is subject to the risks that borrowers may refinance these loans during periods of declining interest rates 
also  when loans are at their floors  there is a further risk that our interest income may not increase as rapidly as our cost of funds during periods of increasing interest rates which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
further  a prolonged period of exceptionally low market interest rates  such as we are currently experiencing  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations as a result of substantially reduced asset yields 
also  our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet or projected operating results 
historically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability 
during the last four years  it has been the policy of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of us treasury and mortgage backed securities 
as a result  yields on securities we have purchased  and market rates on the loans we have originated  have been at levels lower than were available prior to consequently  the average yield on our interest earning assets has decreased during the recent low interest rate environment 
as a general matter  our interest bearing liabilities re price or mature more quickly than our interest earning assets  which has contributed to increases in net interest income in the short term 
however  our ability to lower our interest expense is limited at these interest rate levels  while the average yield on our interest earning assets may continue to decrease 
the federal reserve has indicated its intention to maintain low interest rates in the near future 
accordingly  our net interest income may decrease  which may have an adverse affect on our profitability 
for information with respect to changes in interest rates  see risk factors our results of operations  liquidity and cash flows are subject to interest rate risk 
if our investment in the federal home loan bank of seattle becomes impaired  our earnings and shareholders equity could decrease 
at december   the company had recorded million in fhlb stock  compared to million at december  the banks investments in fhlb stock are generally viewed as a long term investment and are carried at par value per share  which reasonably approximates its fair value 
it does not have a readily determinable fair value 
ownership of fhlb stock is restricted to the fhlb and member institutions and can only be purchased and redeemed at par 
as members of the fhlb system  the banks are required to maintain a minimum level of investment in fhlb stock based on specific percentages of their outstanding fhlb advances 
for the years ended december   and  the banks did not receive any dividend income on fhlb stock 
management periodically evaluates fhlb stock for impairment 
management determination of whether these investments are impaired is based on its assessment of the ultimate recoverability of cost rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value 
the determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability of cost is influenced by criteria such as the significance of any decline in net assets of the fhlb as compared to the capital stock amount for the fhlb and the length of time this situation has persisted  commitments by the fhlb to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the fhlb  the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and  accordingly  the customer base of the fhlb  and the liquidity position of the fhlb 
the seattle fhlb announced that it had a risk based capital deficiency under the regulations of the federal housing finance agency the fhfa  its primary regulator  as of december   and that it would suspend future dividends and the repurchase and redemption of outstanding common stock 
the fhlb of seattle announced september  that the fhfa now considers the fhlb of seattle to be adequately capitalized 
dividends on  or repurchases of  the fhlb of seattle stock continue to require consent of the fhfa 
the fhfa subsequently approved the repurchase of portions of fhlb of seattle stock  and as of december   the fhlb had repurchased  of the banks stock 
the company will continue to monitor the financial condition of the fhlb as it relates to  among other things  the recoverability of banner investment 
based on the above  the company has determined there is not any impairment on the fhlb stock investment as of december  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act has  among other things  tightened capital standards  created a new consumer financial protection bureau and will result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations 
the banks are subject to extensive examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by the fdic and the washington dfi  and banner corporation is subject to examination and supervision by the federal reserve 
the fdic  washington dfi and the federal reserve govern the activities in which we may engage  primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund 
these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the ability to impose restrictions on an institution operations  reclassify assets  determine the adequacy of an institution allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed 
additionally  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and has affected the lending  deposit  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations  and to prepare numerous studies and reports for congress 
the federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting and implementing rules and regulations  and consequently  many of the details and much of the impact of the dodd frank act may not be known for many months or years 
certain provisions of the dodd frank act are expected to have a near term impact on us 
for example  a provision of the dodd frank act eliminates the federal prohibitions on paying interest on demand deposits  thus allowing businesses to have interest bearing checking accounts 
depending on competitive responses  this significant change to existing law could have an adverse impact on our interest expense 
the dodd frank act also broadens the base for fdic insurance assessments 
assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
the dodd frank act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor 
the dodd frank act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation and so called golden parachute payments 
the legislation also directs the federal reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives  regardless of whether the company is publicly traded 
the dodd frank act created a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
financial institutions such as the banks with billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators 
it is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact the dodd frank act and the yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks 
however  it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense 
any additional changes in our regulation and oversight  whether in the form of new laws  rules or regulations  could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or prospects 
the short term and long term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and anticipated new capital rules is uncertain 
in june  the federal reserve  fdic and the occ proposed rules that would substantially amend the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to banner corporation and the banks 
the proposed rules were subject to a public comment period that has expired and there is no date set for the adoption of final rules 
various provisions of the dodd frank act increase the capital requirements of bank holding companies  such as banner corporation 
the leverage and risk based capital ratios of these entities may not be lower than the leverage and risk based capital ratios for insured depository institutions 
the proposed rules include new minimum risk based capital and leverage ratios  which would be phased in during and  and would refine the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios 
the proposed new minimum capital level requirements applicable to banner corporation and the banks under the proposals would be i a new common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of increased from  iii a total capital ratio of unchanged from current rules  and iv a tier leverage ratio of for all institutions 
the proposed rules would also establish a capital conservation buffer of above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios  and would result in the following minimum ratios i a common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of  and iii a total capital ratio of 
the new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in january at of risk weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in january an institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends  engaging in share repurchases  and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount 
these limitations would establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions 
while the proposed basel iii changes and other regulatory capital requirements will likely result in generally higher regulatory capital standards  it is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards will ultimately be applied to banner corporation and the banks 
in addition  in the current economic and regulatory environment  regulators of banks and bank holding companies have become more likely to impose capital requirements on bank holding companies and banks that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations 
the application of more stringent capital requirements for banner corporation and the banks could  among other things  result in lower returns on invested capital  require the raising of additional capital  and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements 
furthermore  the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of basel iii could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding  restructure our business models  and or increase our holdings of liquid assets 
implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations  items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions  including paying out dividends or buying back shares 
increases in deposit insurance premiums and special fdic assessments will negatively impact our earnings 
the dodd frank act established of total insured deposits as the minimum reserve ratio 
the fdic has adopted a plan under which it will meet this ratio by the statutory deadline of september  the dodd frank act requires the fdic to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than billion of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio to from the former minimum of 
the fdic has not announced how it will implement this offset 
in addition to the statutory minimum ratio  the fdic must set a designated reserve ratio or drr  which may exceed the statutory minimum 
the fdic has set as the drr 
as required by the dodd frank act  the fdic has adopted final regulations under which insurance premiums are based on an institution total assets minus its tangible equity instead of its deposits 
while our fdic insurance premiums initially have been reduced by these regulations  it is possible that our future insurance premiums will increase under the final regulations 
failure to manage our growth may adversely affect our performance 
our financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to manage past and possible future growth 
future acquisitions and growth may present operating  integration and other issues that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business and the inability to obtain adequate funding may negatively affect growth and  consequently  our earnings capability and capital levels 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans or investment securities and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the washington  oregon or idaho markets in which our loans are concentrated  negative operating results or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued uncertainty in credit markets 
in particular  our liquidity position could be significantly constrained if we are unable to access funds from the federal home loan bank of seattle  the federal reserve bank of san francisco or other wholesale funding sources or if adequate financing is not available at acceptable interest rates 
finally  if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources  our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs 
in this case  our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively affected 
in addition  changes in recent years in the collateralization requirements and other provisions of the washington and oregon public funds deposit programs have changed the economic benefit associated with accepting public funds deposits  which may affect our need to utilize alternative sources of liquidity 
we may engage in fdic assisted transactions  which could present additional risks to our business 
we may have opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in fdic assisted transactions  including transactions in the states of washington  oregon and idaho 
although these fdic assisted transactions typically provide for fdic assistance to an acquirer to mitigate certain risks  such as sharing exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution  we are and would be in future transactions subject to many of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction  including risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the time frames we expect 
in addition  because these acquisitions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time and access to information normally associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated acquisition  we may face additional risks in fdic assisted transactions  including additional strain on management resources  management of problem loans  problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems and impact to our capital resources requiring us to raise additional capital 
we cannot provide assurance that we would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with fdic assisted transactions 
our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new or changing tax  accounting  and regulatory rules and interpretations could significantly impact strategic initiatives  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
the financial services industry is extensively regulated 
federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  not to benefit our shareholders 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution  the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution allowance for loan losses 
the significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in this report under the heading item business regulation 
these regulations  along with the currently existing tax  accounting  securities  insurance  and monetary laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance  and govern financial reporting and disclosures 
these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer  restrict mergers and acquisitions  investments  access to capital  the location of banking offices  and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
for example  regulatory changes to the rules for overdraft fees for debit transactions and interchange fees have the potential to reduce our fee income which would result in a reduction of our non interest income 
further  legislative proposals limiting our rights as a creditor could result in credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor 
if proposals such as these  or other proposals limiting our rights as a creditor  were to be implemented  we could experience increased credit losses on our loans  or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor 
our failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputational damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
our litigation related costs might continue to increase 
the banks are subject to a variety of legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of the banks business 
in the current economic environment  the banks involvement in litigation has increased significantly  primarily as a result of defaulted borrowers asserting claims to defeat or delay foreclosure proceedings 
there can be no assurance that our loan workout and other activities will not expose us to additional legal actions  including lender liability or environmental claims 
the banks believe that they have meritorious defenses in legal actions where they have been named as defendants and are vigorously defending these suits 
although management  based on discussion with litigation counsel  believes that such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  liquidity and results of operations of the banks  there can be no assurance that a resolution of any pending or future legal matter will not result in significant liability to the banks nor have a material adverse impact on their financial condition  liquidity and results of operations or the banks ability to meet applicable regulatory requirements 
moreover  the expenses of any legal proceedings will adversely affect the banks results of operations until they are resolved 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of  and experience in  the community banking industry where the banks conduct their business 
the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  loan origination  finance  administrative  marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel 
in particular  our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives  including our president  and certain other employees 
in addition  our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the services of our directors  many of whom are at or nearing retirement age  and we may not be able to identify and attract suitable candidates to replace such directors 
our business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes 
our loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to exposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes 
nationally  reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased 
we have also experienced losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses  there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur 
managing reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers  investors and employees 
threats to our reputation can come from many sources  including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally  unethical practices  employee misconduct  failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality  compliance deficiencies  and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers 
we have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct  but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective 
negative publicity regarding our business  employees  or customers  with or without merit  may result in the loss of customers  investors and employees  costly litigation  a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market areas 
the banks face substantial competition in all phases of their operations from a variety of different competitors 
our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment 
to date  the banks have been competitive by focusing on their business lines in their market areas and emphasizing the high level of service and responsiveness desired by their customers 
we compete for loans  deposits and other financial services with other commercial banks  thrifts  credit unions  brokerage houses  mutual funds  insurance companies and specialized finance companies 
many of our competitors offer products and services which we do not offer  and many have substantially greater resources and lending limits  name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than the banks do  and newer competitors may also be more aggressive in terms of pricing loan and deposit products than we are in order to obtain a share of the market 
some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies  federally insured state chartered banks and national banks and federal savings banks 
as a result  these non bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including the following the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors  customer satisfaction with our level of service  and industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
we rely on communications  information  operating and financial control systems technology from third party service providers  and we may suffer an interruption in those systems 
we rely heavily on third party service providers for much of our communications  information  operating and financial control systems technology  including our internet banking services and data processing systems 
any failure or interruption of these services or systems or breaches in security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  servicing and or loan origination systems 
the occurrence of any failures or interruptions may require us to identify alternative sources of such services  and we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us  or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources  if at all

after consideration of these factors  beginning in the third quarter of  we reduced our dividend payout to preserve our capital and further reduced our dividend in the first quarter of our aggregate dividend payments were also reduced by our one for seven reverse stock split effective june  there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock in the future 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock depends primarily on dividends we receive from banner bank and islanders bank 
under federal regulations  the dollar amount of dividends the banks may pay depends upon their capital position and recent net income 
generally  if a bank satisfies its regulatory capital requirements  it may make dividend payments up to the limits prescribed under state law and fdic regulations 
in addition  an institution that has converted to a stock form of ownership may not declare or pay a dividend on  or repurchase any of  its common stock if the effect thereof would cause the regulatory capital of the institution to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account which was established in connection with the conversion 
banner bank  our primary subsidiary  converted to a stock form of ownership and is therefore subject to the limitation described in the preceding sentence 
the washington dfi has the power to require any bank to suspend the payment of any and all dividends 
in addition  under washington law  no bank may declare or pay any dividend in an amount greater than its retained earnings without the prior approval of the washington dfi 
further  under washington law  banner corporation is prohibited from paying a dividend if  after making such dividend payment  it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business  or if its total liabilities  plus the amount that would be needed  in the event banner corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the dividend payment  to satisfy preferential rights on dissolution of holders of preferred stock ranking senior in right of payment to the capital stock on which the applicable distribution is to be made  exceed our total assets 
in addition to the foregoing regulatory considerations  there are numerous governmental requirements and regulations that affect our business activities 
a change in applicable statutes  regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business and on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
payments of the distributions on our trust preferred securities from the special purpose subsidiary trusts we sponsored are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us 
the junior subordinated debentures that we have issued to our subsidiary trusts are ranked senior to our shares of common stock 
we must make required payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our tps and our common stock and  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the interest and principal obligations under the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock 
we may defer the payment of interest on each of the junior subordinated debentures for a period not to exceed consecutive quarters  provided that the deferral period does not extend beyond the stated maturity 
during such deferral period  distributions on the corresponding trust preferred securities will also be deferred and we may not pay cash dividends to the holders of shares of our common stock

we calculate tangible assets by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets from total assets 
we believe that this is consistent with the treatment by our bank regulatory agencies  which exclude goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of risk based capital ratios 
in addition  excluding preferred equity  the level of which may vary from company to company  allows investors to more easily compare our capital adequacy to other companies in the industry that also use this measure 
management believes that these non gaap financial measures provide information to investors that is useful in understanding the basis of our capital position 
however  these non gaap financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on gaap

executive overview we are a bank holding company incorporated in the state of washington and own two subsidiary banks  banner bank and islanders bank 
banner bank is a washington chartered commercial bank that conducts business from its main office in walla walla  washington and  as of december   its branch offices and seven loan production offices located in washington  oregon and idaho 
islanders bank is also a washington chartered commercial bank and conducts its business from three locations in san juan county  washington 
as of december   we had total consolidated assets of billion  net loans of billion  total deposits of billion and total stockholders equity of million 
banner bank is a regional bank which offers a wide variety of commercial banking services and financial products to individuals  businesses and public sector entities in its primary market areas 
islanders bank is a community bank which offers similar banking services to individuals  businesses and public entities located in the san juan islands 
the banks primary business is that of traditional banking institutions  accepting deposits and originating loans in locations surrounding their offices in portions of washington  oregon and idaho 
banner bank is also an active participant in the secondary market  engaging in mortgage banking operations largely through the origination and sale of one to four family residential loans 
banner corporation experienced marked improvement in asset quality and operating results  which continued and accelerated throughout highlights for the year included further improvement in our asset quality metrics  additional customer account growth  significantly increased non interest bearing deposit balances  exceptional mortgage banking activity and record revenues from core operations 
as a result  substantially reduced credit costs  significant improvement in our net interest margin and strong non interest revenues all contributed to meaningfully increased profitability in for the year ended december   we had net income of million which  after providing for the preferred stock dividend  related discount accretion and gains on repurchases of preferred stock  resulted in a net income available to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share 
this compares to a net income of million  but a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  also notable during was the repurchase and retirement of all of our series a preferred stock 
as a result of these repurchase transactions  we realized gains of million 
although there continue to be indications that economic conditions are improving from the recent recessionary downturn  the pace of recovery has been modest and uneven and ongoing stress in the economy will likely continue to be challenging going forward 
as a result  our future operating results and financial performance will be significantly affected by the course of recovery 
however  over the past four years we have significantly improved our risk profile by aggressively managing and reducing our problem assets which contributed substantially to our return to profitability in and and which we believe provide the foundation for sustainable improvement to our operating results in future periods 
our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the decrease from a year earlier reflects significant progress in reducing the levels of delinquencies  non performing loans and net charge offs  particularly for loans for the construction of one to four family homes and for acquisition and development of land for residential properties 
from through  higher than historical provision for loan losses was the most significant factor adversely affecting our operating results 
looking forward  we anticipate that our continuing efforts to decrease non performing loans should result in a return to more normal levels of loan loss provisioning in future periods 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  as well as asset quality below 
aside from the level of loan loss provision  our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income 
as more fully explained below  our net interest income before provision for loan losses increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million  which followed an increase of million for the prior year  primarily as a result of an expansion of our net interest spread and net interest margin due to a lower cost of funds and a reduction in the adverse impact of non performing assets 
the trend to lower funding costs and the resulting increase in the net interest margin was driven by rapidly declining interest expense on deposits and represents an important improvement in our core operating fundamentals 
the increase in net interest income occurred despite a modest decline in average earning assets in  as we continued to make changes in our mix of assets and liabilities designed to reduce our risk profile and produce more sustainable earnings 
our net income also is affected by the level of our other operating income  including deposit fees and service charges  loan origination and servicing fees  and gains and losses on the sale of loans and securities  as well as our non interest operating expenses and income tax provisions 
in addition  our net income is affected by the net change in the value of certain financial instruments carried at fair value and in certain periods by other than temporary impairment otti charges or recoveries 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net charge of million in fair value adjustments compared to a net charge of  for the year ended december  also  for the year ended december   our net income included a  net otti charge 
by comparison  for the year ended december   we had a net otti recovery of million as a result of the full cash repayment on a security that had been written off as an otti charge in our other operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  however  other operating income  excluding fair value and otti adjustments  was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to a year earlier 
our total revenues net interest income before the provision for loan losses plus other operating income for were million compared to million for our revenues excluding fair value and otti adjustments  which we believe is more indicative of our core operations  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this growth in core revenues was the result of the meaningful increases in our net interest income  and deposit fees and service charges  as well as a substantial increase in revenues from mortgage banking activities 
our other operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   largely as a result of decreased costs related to reo operations  fdic deposit insurance and professional services  which were partially offset by increased compensation expenses 
while much lower in than in  both years expenses reflect significant costs associated with problem loan collection activities  including professional services and valuation charges related to reo  which we believe will decline further in future periods provided reductions in non performing assets continue 
in addition  reflecting our return to profitability and expectation of sustainable profitability in future periods  during  we reversed all of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets and significantly adjusted the fair value estimate for our junior subordinated debentures 
the substantial changes to both of these significant accounting estimates were directly linked to our improved performance and profitability 
for the year ended december   the elimination of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  combined with the company pre tax income  resulted in a net tax benefit of million  which substantially added to our net income for the year 
as noted above  for the years ended december  and  our net income included significant adjustments related to the valuation of selected financial assets and liabilities we record at fair value  as well as otti losses in and an otti recovery in however  for comparison purposes we often present information excluding these fair value and otti adjustments 
revenues and other earnings information excluding the change in valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value and otti recoveries or losses represent non gaap financial measures 
management has presented these non gaap financial measures in this discussion and analysis because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations 
where applicable  we have also presented comparable earnings information using gaap financial measures 
for a reconciliation of these non gaap measures  see the tables below  as well as the discussion related to tangible common stockholders equity per share and the ratio of common stockholders tangible equity to tangible assets in footnote number to the key financial ratios tables 
these non gaap financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on gaap

our lending activities are primarily directed toward the origination of real estate and commercial loans 
until recent periods  real estate lending activities were significantly focused on residential construction and first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residential properties  however  over the previous four years our origination of construction and land development loans declined materially and the proportion of the portfolio invested in these types of loans has declined substantially 
more recently  we have experienced increased demand for one to four family construction loans and outstanding balances have increased modestly 
our residential mortgage loan originations also decreased during the earlier years of this cycle  although less significantly than the decline in construction and land development lending as exceptionally low interest rates supported demand for loans to refinance existing debt as well as loans to finance home purchases 
refinancing activity was particularly significant in  leading to a meaningful increase in residential mortgage originations compared to the same period a year earlier 
despite the recent increase in these loan originations  our outstanding balances for residential mortgages have continued to decline  as most of the new originations have been sold in the secondary market while existing residential loans have been repaying at an accelerated pace 
our real estate lending activities also include the origination of multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
while reduced from periods prior to the economic slowdown  our level of activity and investment in these types of loans has been relatively stable in recent periods 
our commercial business lending is directed toward meeting the credit and related deposit needs of various small to medium sized business and agribusiness borrowers operating in our primary market areas 
reflecting the weak economy  in recent periods demand for these types of commercial business loans has been modest and  aside from seasonal variations  total outstanding balances have remained relatively unchanged 
our consumer loan activity is primarily directed at meeting demand from our existing deposit customers and  while we have increased our emphasis on consumer lending in recent years  demand for consumer loans also has been modest during this period of economic weakness as we believe many consumers have been focused on reducing their personal debt 
at december   our net loan portfolio totaled billion compared to billion at december  deposits  customer retail repurchase agreements and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes 
we compete with other financial institutions and financial intermediaries in attracting deposits and we generally attract deposits within our primary market areas 
much of the focus of our earlier branch expansion and current marketing efforts have been directed toward attracting additional deposit customer relationships and balances 
the long term success of our deposit gathering activities is reflected not only in the growth of deposit balances  but also in increases in the level of deposit fees  service charges and other payment processing revenues compared to periods prior to that expansion 
for the two years ended december   we have had a meaningful increase of transaction and savings accounts checking  savings and money market accounts and related fees and payment processing revenues  as we have remained focused on growing these core deposits 
total deposits at december  increased million to billion  compared to billion a year earlier 
however  the mix of our deposits significantly changed as certificates of deposit decreased million  while core deposits increased million  with particularly strong growth in non interest bearing checking accounts  which increased million for the year 
critical accounting policies in the opinion of management  the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition and related consolidated statements of operations  comprehensive income  changes in stockholders equity and cash flows reflect all adjustments which include reclassification and normal recurring adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in particular  management has identified several accounting policies that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
these policies relate to i the methodology for the recognition of interest income  ii determination of the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses  iii the valuation of financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value  including otti losses  iv the valuation of intangibles  such as core deposit intangibles and mortgage servicing rights  v the valuation of real estate held for sale and vi the valuation of or recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
these policies and judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail below 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate based on the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the financial statements to these critical accounting policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition 
further  subsequent changes in economic or market conditions could have a material impact on these estimates and our financial condition and operating results in future periods 
there have been no significant changes in our application of accounting policies since december  for additional information concerning critical accounting policies  see notes    and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the following interest income notes and interest on loans and securities is accrued as earned unless management doubts the collectability of the asset or the unpaid interest 
interest accruals on loans are generally discontinued when loans become days past due for payment of interest and the loans are then placed on nonaccrual status 
all previously accrued but uncollected interest is deducted from interest income upon transfer to nonaccrual status 
for any future payments collected  interest income is recognized only upon management s assessment that there is a strong likelihood that the full amount of a loan will be repaid or recovered 
a loan may be put on nonaccrual status sooner than this policy would dictate if  in management s judgment  the amounts owed  principal or interest  may be uncollectable 
while less common  similar interest reversal and nonaccrual treatment is applied to investment securities if their ultimate collectability becomes questionable 
provision and allowance for loan losses notes and the provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses consistent in all material respects with the gaap guidelines outlined in asc  contingencies 
we have established systematic methodologies for the determination of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
the methodologies are set forth in a formal policy and take into consideration the need for an overall general valuation allowance as well as specific allowances that are tied to individual problem loans 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for probable loan losses against our income and value impaired loans consistent with the accounting guidelines outlined in asc  receivables 
the allowance for losses on loans is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and upon our continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include  among others  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency rates  actual loan loss experience  current and anticipated economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
realized losses related to specific assets are applied as a reduction of the carrying value of the assets and charged immediately against the allowance for loan loss reserve 
recoveries on previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance 
the reserve is based upon factors and trends identified by us at the time financial statements are prepared 
although we use the best information available  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary due to economic  operating  regulatory and other conditions beyond our control 
the adequacy of general and specific reserves is based on our continuing evaluation of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio as well as individual review of certain large balance loans 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  we determine that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  the financial condition of the borrower  the value of the underlying collateral and the current status of the economy 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
subsequent changes in the value of impaired loans are included within the provision for loan losses in the same manner in which impairment initially was recognized or as a reduction in the provision that would otherwise be reported 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment include residential real estate and consumer loans and  as appropriate  smaller balance non homogeneous loans 
larger balance non homogeneous residential construction and land  commercial real estate  commercial business loans and unsecured loans are individually evaluated for impairment 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include specific allowances  an allocated formula allowance and an unallocated allowance 
losses on specific loans are provided for when the losses are probable and estimable 
general loan loss reserves are established to provide for inherent loan portfolio risks not specifically provided for 
the level of general reserves is based on analysis of potential exposures existing in our loan portfolio including evaluation of historical trends  current market conditions and other relevant factors identified by us at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans  excluding those loans that are subject to individual analysis for specific allowances 
loss factors are based on our historical loss experience adjusted for significant environmental considerations  including the experience of other banking organizations  which in our judgment affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the unallocated allowance is based upon our evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
this methodology may result in losses or recoveries differing significantly from those provided in the consolidated financial statements 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the determination of the amount of the banks allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the adjustment of reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
fair value accounting and measurement notes and we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures 
we include in the notes to the consolidated financial statements information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure financial assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and the impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  for financial instruments not recorded at fair value we disclose  where appropriate  our estimate of their fair value 
for more information regarding fair value accounting  please refer to note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other intangible assets notes and other intangible assets consists primarily of core deposit intangibles cdi  which are amounts recorded in business combinations or deposit purchase transactions related to the value of transaction related deposits and the value of the customer relationships associated with the deposits 
core deposit intangibles are being amortized on an accelerated basis over a weighted average estimated useful life of eight years 
these assets are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances that could impact their recoverability 
these events could include loss of the underlying core deposits  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent other identifiable intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable  impairment losses are recorded in other non interest expense to reduce the carrying amount of the assets 
mortgage servicing rights servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of loans 
generally  purchased servicing rights are capitalized at the cost to acquire the rights 
for sales of mortgage loans  the value of the servicing right is estimated and capitalized 
fair value is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts 
capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into non interest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
real estate held for sale notes and property acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure is recorded at the lower of the estimated fair value of the property  less expected selling costs  or the carrying value of the defaulted loan 
development and improvement costs relating to the property may be capitalized  while other holding costs are expensed 
the carrying value of the property is periodically evaluated by management and  if necessary  allowances are established to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value 
gains or losses at the time the property is sold are charged or credited to operations in the period in which they are realized 
the amounts the banks will ultimately recover from real estate held for sale may differ substantially from the carrying value of the assets because of market factors beyond the banks control or because of changes in the banks strategies for recovering the investment 
income taxes and deferred taxes note the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries file consolidated us federal income tax returns  as well as state income tax returns in oregon and idaho 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the enacted tax rates which are expected to be in effect when the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities are expected to be reported in the company s income tax returns 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
under gaap asc  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized

comparison of financial condition at december  and general 
total assets in aggregate were nearly unchanged at billion at december   compared to billion at december  however  net loans receivable gross loans less deferred fees and discounts  and allowance for loan losses decreased million  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  the contraction in net loans primarily reflects decreases in residential and non owner occupied commercial real estate loans  as continued refinancing activity resulted in significant levels of loan prepayments 
one to four family residential real estate loans decreased million during  while non owner occupied commercial real estate loans decreased million 
in addition  residential and commercial land and land development loans  in aggregate  decreased million during and commercial construction loans decreased million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in commercial loans  including owner occupied commercial real estate  and commercial and agricultural business loans 
during  owner occupied commercial real estate loans increased million  while commercial business loans increased million and agricultural business loans increased by million 
the net decrease in loans was partially offset by a reduction of million in the allowance for loan losses  as net charge offs modestly exceeded the provision for loan losses during the year ended december  the decrease in aggregate loan balances for the year in part also reflects our efforts to reduce our exposure to certain weaker credits as we continued to aggressively manage problem assets 
while demand for consumer loans remained weak and utilization of existing credit lines for consumer and commercial borrowers was low  our production of new commercial real estate and commercial and agricultural business loans was again encouraging 
importantly  the change in total assets also reflects a million decrease in reo which was more than offset by a million increase in deferred tax assets primarily as the result of the elimination of the valuation allowance for those assets 
securities increased to million at december   from million at december   and the aggregate total of securities and interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million at december   compared to million a year earlier 
securities acquired during the year generally have expected maturities ranging from six months to six years and were purchased to generate a modest increase in yield compared to interest bearing cash balances 
with the exception of certain trust preferred securities  aggregate fair value adjustments to the securities portfolio were modest during the first nine months of at december   the fair value of our trading securities was million less than their amortized cost 
the reduction reflected in the fair value of these securities compared to their amortized cost primarily was centered in single issuer trust preferred securities and collateralized debt obligations secured by pools of trust preferred securities issued by bank holding companies and insurance companies  partially offset by modest gains in all other trading securities 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our available for sale portfolio grew during the year  as purchases of primarily us government and agency mortgage related and asset backed securities exceeded net repayments  sales and maturities of other securities by million 
periodically  we also acquire securities primarily municipal bonds which are generally designated as held to maturity and this portfolio increased by million from the prior year end balances 
reo decreased million  to million at december  compared to million at december   continuing the improving trend with respect to these non earning assets 
the december  total included million in land or land development projects  million in commercial real estate and million in single family homes and related residential construction 
during the year ended december   we transferred million of loans into reo  capitalized additional investments of  in acquired properties  disposed of approximately million of properties and recognized  of charges against current earnings for valuation adjustments for reo properties net of gains related to properties sold 
see asset quality discussion below 
deposits increased million  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  non interest bearing deposits increased by million  or  to million from million  and interest bearing transaction and savings accounts increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  offsetting these increases  certificates of deposit decreased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the growth in non interest bearing deposits and other transaction and savings accounts was particularly notable and significantly contributed to our improved net interest margin and deposit fee revenues 
a portion of the decrease in certificates of deposit was in brokered certificates which decreased million from the prior year end balance  however  much of the decrease reflects management s pricing decisions designed to allow maturing higher priced retail certificates to migrate off the balance sheet or into core deposits 
fhlb advances decreased  to million at december  from million at december   while other borrowings decreased million to million at december  the modest decrease in fhlb advances reflects a limited amount of maturities and no additional borrowing as a part of our short term cash management activities 
other borrowings at december  were comprised of million of retail repurchase agreements that are primarily related to customer cash management accounts as compared to million at december  retail repurchase agreement balances decreased during the year as many customers elected to keep more of their funds in the related non interest bearing transaction accounts to receive earnings credit to offset the service fees associated with those accounts or utilized funds for alternative purposes including paying down credit lines 
included in other borrowings at december  was million of qualifying senior bank notes covered by the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp with a fixed interest rate of 
this debt  which was issued in march to strengthen our overall liquidity position as we adjusted to a lower level of public funds deposits  was repaid on march  no additional junior subordinated debentures were issued or matured during the year  however  the estimated fair value of these instruments increased to million from million a year ago as a result of a significant change in the discount rate used to estimate fair value of these financial instruments 
for more information  see notes  and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
total stockholders equity decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to the redemption of the million of series a preferred stock  which was partially offset by capital raised through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase and sale plan drip and retained earnings from operations 
during the year ended december   we issued  additional shares of common stock for million at an average net per share price of through our drip 
the increase in paid in capital from stock issuances  as well as additions to retained earnings as a result of net income from operations and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income  were reduced by the accrual and payment of preferred and common stock dividends and the redemption of the series a preferred stock  resulting in the net million decrease in total stockholders equity 
tangible common stockholders equity  which excludes the series a preferred stock and intangible assets  increased million to million  or of tangible assets at december  during the year ended december   we did not repurchase any shares of banner corporation common stock 
investments at december   our consolidated investment portfolio totaled million and consisted principally of us government and agency obligations  mortgage backed and mortgage related securities  municipal bonds  corporate debt obligations  and asset backed securities 
from time to time  our investment levels may be increased or decreased depending upon yields available on investment alternatives and management s projections as to the demand for funds to be used in our loan origination  deposit and other activities 
during the year ended december   our aggregate investment in securities increased million 
holdings of mortgage backed securities increased million  municipal bonds increased million  and corporate bonds increased million while asset backed securities  which were all purchased during the year  increased million 
partially offsetting these increases was a net decrease in us government and agency obligations of million 
us government and agency obligations our portfolio of us government and agency obligations had a carrying value of million million at amortized cost  with a fair value adjustment of million at december   a weighted average contractual maturity of years and a weighted average coupon rate of 
most of the us government and agency obligations we own include call features which allow the issuing agency the right to call the securities at various dates prior to the final maturity 
certain agency obligations also include step up provisions which provide for periodic increases in the coupon rate if the call options are not exercised 
mortgage backed obligations at december   our mortgage backed and mortgage related securities had a carrying value of million million at amortized cost  with a fair value adjustment of million 
the weighted average coupon rate of these securities was and the weighted average contractual maturity was years  although we receive principal payments on these securities each period resulting in a much shorter expected average life 
as of december   of the mortgage backed and mortgage related securities pay interest at a fixed rate and pay at an adjustable interest rate 
we do not believe that any of our mortgage backed obligations had a meaningful exposure to sub prime mortgages 
municipal bonds the carrying value of our tax exempt bonds at december  was million also with an amortized cost of million  and was comprised of general obligation bonds ie  backed by the general credit of the issuer and revenue bonds ie  backed by revenues from the specific project being financed issued by cities and counties and various housing authorities  and hospital  school  water and sanitation districts located in the states of washington  oregon and idaho  our primary service area 
we also had taxable bonds in our municipal bond portfolio  which at december  had a carrying value of million also million at amortized cost 
many of our qualifying municipal bonds are not rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency due to the smaller size of the total issuance and a portion of these bonds have been acquired through direct private placement by the issuers 
we have not experienced any defaults or payment deferrals on our municipal bonds 
at december   our municipal bond portfolio  including taxable and tax exempt  had a weighted average maturity of approximately years and a weighted average coupon rate of 
corporate bonds our corporate bond portfolio  which had a carrying value of million million at amortized cost at december   was comprised principally of long term adjustable rate capital securities issued by financial institutions  including single issuers  trust preferred securities and collateralized debt obligations secured by pools of trust preferred securities issued by bank holding companies and insurance companies 
the market for these capital securities deteriorated significantly in and and in our opinion is still not currently functioning in a meaningful manner 
as a result  the fair value estimates for many of these securities are more subjective than in periods before when they were acquired 
nonetheless  it is apparent that the values have declined appreciably since purchase  which is reflected in our financial statements and results of operations 
in addition to the disruption in the market for these securities  the decline in value also reflects deterioration in the financial condition of some of the issuing financial institutions and payment deferrals and defaults by certain institutions 
see critical accounting policies above and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the portfolio had a weighted average maturity of years and a weighted average coupon rate of 
asset backed securities at december   our asset backed securities portfolio had a carrying value of million million at amortized cost  and was comprised primarily of securitized pools of student loans issued or guaranteed by the student loan marketing association slma 
the weighted average coupon rate of these adjustable rate securities was  the adjustments are tied to changes in three month libor and the weighted average contractual maturity was years

loans and lending 
our loan portfolio decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to a decrease of million  or  during the year ended december  while we originate a variety of loans  our ability to originate each type of loan is dependent upon the relative customer demand and competition in each market we serve 
reflecting the recession in and and subsequent modest pace of recovery  loan demand  other than for lower rate refinancing of real estate loans  has been weak for most of the past five years as consumers and businesses have been cautious in their use of credit 
however  we have implemented strategies designed to capture more market share and achieve increases in targeted loans and our loan originations increased meaningfully in and nonetheless  looking forward  new loan originations and portfolio balances will continue to be significantly affected by the course of the recovery from the current sluggish economic environment 
for the years ended december   and  we originated loans  net of repayments and charge offs  of million  million and million  respectively 
the level of net originations during all three years was significantly impacted by a substantial amount of loan repayments and charge offs 
we generally sell a significant portion of our newly originated one to four family residential mortgage loans to secondary market purchasers 
proceeds from sales of loans for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
see loan servicing portfolio below 
loans held for sale increased to million at december   compared to million at december  at various times  we also purchase whole loans and participation interests in loans 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased million  million and  respectively  of loans and loan participation interests 
one to four family residential real estate lending at december   million  or  of our loan portfolio  consisted of permanent loans on one to four family residences 
we are active originators of one to four family residential loans in communities where we have established offices in washington  oregon and idaho 
our originations of one to four family residential loans were particularly strong in  however  since most of these new loans were sold in the secondary market and principal repayments on existing loans were substantial  we had a million decrease in the balance of loans on one to four family residences compared to the prior year 
our one to four family loan originations totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
construction and land lending historically  we invested a significant proportion of our loan portfolio in residential construction loans  as well as land loans and loans for the construction of commercial and multifamily real estate 
however  as housing markets weakened in  we significantly reduced our origination of new construction and land development loans 
the slower pace of originations coupled with repayments as a result of home sales and restructuring opportunities as well as charge off and foreclosure actions caused our portfolio of one to four family construction loans to decrease substantially through reversing this trend during the year ended december   one to four family construction loans increased by million to million 
land development loans both residential and commercial decreased by million to million at december  although significantly below our production levels prior to the beginning of the housing downturn  our construction loan originations have increased for each of the past three years as builders have adjusted to new price levels and certain sub markets have become more active 
our construction and land development loan originations totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and million in at december   construction and land loans totaled million including million of one to four family construction loans  million of residential land or land development loans  million of commercial and multifamily real estate construction loans and million of commercial land or land development loans  or of total loans  compared to million  or  at december  the geographic distribution of our construction and land development loans is approximately in the greater puget sound market and in the greater portland  oregon market  with the remaining in the various eastern washington  eastern oregon and western idaho markets we serve 
while delinquencies and defaults in residential construction and land development loans had a material adverse effect on our results of operations for much of the recent economic cycle  at december   only million were classified as non performing loans 
for the year ended december   performing construction loans made an important contribution to our net interest income and profitability 
commercial and multifamily real estate lending we also originate loans secured by multifamily and commercial real estate 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans originated by us are both fixed and adjustable rate loans generally with intermediate terms of five to ten years 
our commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans on a variety of property types with no significant concentrations by property type  borrowers or locations 
we experienced reasonable demand for both multifamily and commercial real estate loans in  though total balances in these categories decreased million or from the prior year end 
at december   our loan portfolio included billion of commercial real estate loans  or of the total loan portfolio 
our portfolio of multifamily loans was much smaller  at million  or of total loans 
commercial business lending we are active in small to medium sized business lending 
in addition to providing earning assets  this type of lending has helped increase our deposit base 
reflecting the relatively weak economic environment  demand for new loans remained modest and line utilizations continued to be low in  however  our production levels for targeted loans were encouraging and resulted in a million  or  increase in commercial business loan balances for the year 
this growth occurred despite our successful efforts to reduce our exposure to certain weak or non performing borrowers 
at december   commercial business loans totaled million  or of total loans  compared to million  or  at december  agricultural lending agriculture is a major industry in many washington  oregon and idaho locations in our service area 
while agricultural loans are not a large part of our portfolio  we routinely make agricultural loans to borrowers with a strong capital base  sufficient management depth  proven ability to operate through agricultural cycles  reliable cash flows and adequate financial reporting 
payments on agricultural loans depend  to a large degree  on the results of operation of the related farm entity 
the repayment is also subject to other economic and weather conditions as well as market prices for agricultural products  which can be highly volatile at times 
generally  in recent years  weather conditions  production levels and market prices have been good for most of our agricultural borrowers 
our production levels for agricultural loans were consistent with recent years and at december   agricultural loans totaled million  or of the loan portfolio  compared to million  or  at december  consumer and other lending we originate a variety of consumer loans  including home equity lines of credit  automobile  recreational vehicle and boat loans  credit cards and loans secured by deposit accounts 
consumer lending has traditionally been a modest part of our business with loans made primarily to accommodate our existing customer base 
in recent years  including  demand for consumer loans has been restrained and outstanding balances have decreased modestly 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased approximately million of consumer loans originated by another northwest financial institution that are secured by recreational boats 
at december   we had million  or of our loan portfolio  in consumer loans  compared to million  or  at december  as of december   of our consumer loans were secured by one to four family real estate  including home equity lines of credit 
credit card balances totaled million at december  compared to million a year earlier 
loan servicing portfolio at december   we were servicing billion of loans for others and held million in escrow for our portfolio of loans serviced for others 
the loan servicing portfolio at december  was composed of million of freddie mac residential mortgage loans  million of fannie mae residential mortgage loans and million of both residential and non residential mortgage loans serviced for a variety of private investors 
the portfolio included loans secured by property located primarily in the states of washington  oregon and idaho 
for the year ended december   we recognized  of loan servicing fees in our results of operations  which were net of million of amortization for mortgage servicing rights msrs and a  impairment charge for a valuation adjustment to msrs 
mortgage servicing rights we record msrs with respect to loans we originate and sell in the secondary market on a servicing retained basis 
the value of msrs is capitalized and amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized million  million  and million  respectively  of msrs relating to loans sold with servicing retained 
no msrs were purchased in those periods 
amortization of msrs for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
management periodically evaluates the estimates and assumptions used to determine the carrying values of msrs and the amortization of msrs 
these carrying values are adjusted when the valuation indicates the carrying value is impaired 
at december   our msrs were carried at a value of million  net of amortization  compared to million at december  table loan portfolio analysis the following table sets forth the composition of the company s loan portfolio  including loans held for sale  by type of loan as of the dates indicated dollars in thousands december amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total commercial real estate owner occupied investment properties multifamily real estate commercial construction multifamily construction one to four family construction land and land development residential commercial commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland one to four family real estate consumer secured by one to four family real estate consumer other total loans outstanding less allowance for loan losses net loans table loans by geographic concentration the following table sets forth the company s loans by geographic concentration at december  dollars in thousands washington oregon idaho other total commercial real estate owner occupied investment properties multifamily real estate commercial construction multifamily construction one to four family construction land and land development residential commercial commercial business agricultural business  including secured by farmland one to four family real estate consumer secured by one to four family real estate consumer other total loans outstanding percent of total loans the following table sets forth certain information at december  regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in our portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity  but does not include scheduled payments or potential prepayments

the average life of loans typically is substantially less than their contractual maturities because of principal repayments and prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on certain mortgage loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decreases when rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan market rates

increasing core deposits transaction and savings accounts is a fundamental element of our business strategy 
this strategy continues to improve our cost of funds and increase the opportunity for deposit fee revenues  while stabilizing our funding base 
total deposits increased million  to billion at december  from billion at december   non interest bearing deposits increased by million  or  to million at year end from million at december   and interest bearing transaction and savings accounts increased by million  or  to billion at december  compared to billion a year earlier 
this core deposit growth augmented similarly strong results in and coupled with significantly better pricing was primarily responsible for the much improved net interest margin we experienced in offsetting these increases  certificates of deposit decreased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  a portion of the decrease in certificates of deposit was in brokered certificates  which decreased million from the prior year end balances  however  much of the decrease reflects a reduction in retail certificates as a result of management s pricing decisions designed to allow maturing higher priced certificates to migrate off the balance sheet or into core deposit accounts

to access funds  we are required to own a sufficient level of capital stock in the fhlb seattle and may apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and securities provided that certain creditworthiness standards have been met 
at december   we had million of borrowings from the fhlb seattle at fair value at a weighted average rate of  a decrease of  compared to a year earlier 
also at december   we had an investment of million in fhlb seattle capital stock 
at that date  banner bank was authorized by the fhlb seattle to borrow up to million under a blanket floating lien security agreement  while islanders bank was approved to borrow up to million under a similar agreement

at december   based upon our available unencumbered collateral  banner bank was eligible to borrow million from the federal reserve bank  however  at that date we had no funds borrowed under this arrangement 
we also issue retail repurchase agreements to customers that are primarily related to customer cash management accounts and in the past have borrowed funds through the use of secured wholesale repurchase agreements with securities brokers 
in each case  the repurchase agreements are generally due within days 
at december   retail repurchase agreements totaling million  with a weighted average rate of  were secured by a pledge of certain mortgage backed securities and agency securities with a market value of million

asset quality while non performing assets declined substantially in and  beginning in the third quarter of and continuing throughout and  housing markets deteriorated in many of our primary service areas and we experienced significantly higher levels of delinquencies and non performing assets  primarily in our construction and land development loan portfolios 
during this period  home and lot sales activity was exceptionally slow  causing stress on builders and developers cash flows and their ability to service debt  which was reflected in our increased non performing asset totals 
further  property values generally declined  reducing the value of the collateral securing loans 
in addition  other non housing related segments of the loan portfolio developed signs of stress and increasing levels of non performing loans as the effects of the recessionary economy became more evident and the pace of the recovery remained slow 
as a result  our provision for loan losses was significantly higher than historical levels and our normal expectations 
this higher than normal level of delinquencies and non accruals also had a material adverse effect on operating income as a result of foregone interest revenues  increased loan collection costs and carrying costs and valuation adjustments for real estate acquired through foreclosure 
while our non performing assets have been significantly reduced  resulting in materially reduced credit costs in  and we are actively engaged with our borrowers in resolving remaining problem assets  our future results will continue to be meaningfully influenced by the course of recovery from the economic recession 
however  our reserve levels are substantial and  as a result of our impairment analysis and charge off actions  reflect current appraisals and valuation estimates as well as recent regulatory examination results 
non performing assets decreased to million  or of total assets  at december   from million  or of total assets  at december   and million  or of total assets  at december  construction and land development loans  including related reo  represented approximately of our non performing assets at december  reflecting lingering weakness in the economy and property values which now have generally stabilized but are lower than when many of the related loans were originated  we continued to provide for loan losses at a relatively high level during and maintained a substantial allowance for loan losses at year end even though non performing loans and total loans outstanding declined 
at december   our allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans and of non performing loans  compared to million  or of total loans and of non performing loans at december  included in our allowance at december  was an unallocated portion of million  which is based upon our evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
we continue to believe our level of non performing loans and assets  which declined significantly during the past two years  is manageable and we believe that we have sufficient capital and human resources to manage the collection of our non performing assets in an orderly fashion 
the primary components of the million in non performing assets are million in nonaccrual loans and million in reo and other repossessed assets 
the geographic distribution of non performing assets included approximately million  or  in the puget sound region  million  or  in the greater portland market area  million  or  in the greater boise market area  and million  or  in other areas of washington  oregon and idaho 
loans are reported as restructured when we grant concessions to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties that we would not otherwise consider 
as a result of these concessions  restructured loans are impaired as the banks will not collect all amounts due  both principal and interest  in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
if any restructured loan becomes delinquent or other matters call into question the borrower ability to repay full interest and principal in accordance with the restructured terms  the restructured loan s would be reclassified as nonaccrual 
at december   we had million of restructured loans currently performing under their restructured terms

for the year ended december   million in interest income would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans been current  and no interest income on these loans was included in net income for this period 
real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate held for sale until it is sold 
when property is acquired  it is recorded at the lower of the estimated fair value of the property  less expected selling costs  or the carrying value of the defaulted loan 
subsequent to foreclosure  the property is carried at the lower of the foreclosed amount or net realizable value 
upon receipt of a new appraisal and market analysis  the carrying value is written down through the establishment of a specific reserve to the anticipated sales price  less selling and holding costs 
these loans are performing under their restructured terms 
in addition to the non performing loans noted in table  as of december   we had classified loans with an aggregate outstanding balance of million that are not on nonaccrual status  with respect to which known information concerning possible credit problems with the borrowers or the cash flows of the properties securing the respective loans has caused management to be concerned about the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms 
this may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the nonaccrual loan category

the decrease in credit costs reflects a substantially reduced level of non performing assets while the increase in revenues was driven by improvement in our net interest income and deposit fees and other service charges fueled by growth in core deposits and  in  significantly increased revenues from mortgage banking operations and a substantial net benefit from income taxes 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  which  after providing for the preferred stock dividend of million  the related discount accretion of million  and including a million gain on repurchase and retirement of preferred stock  resulted in net income to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share 
this compares to net income of million  which  after providing for the preferred stock dividend of million and related discount accretion of million  resulted in a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
for the year ending december   our results also include a net tax benefit of million  primarily the result of a reversal of a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
aside from credit costs  our operating results depend largely on our net interest income which  as explained below  increased by million to million  primarily because of a significant reduction in deposit costs and a reduction in the adverse effect of non performing assets 
our operating results for the year ended december  also reflected a decrease in other operating income  which was particularly influenced by a net charge of million as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value that was only partially offset by increases in deposit fees and service charges  revenues from mortgage banking operations and miscellaneous other operating income 
by comparison  for the year ended december   we recorded a million recovery of a previous otti charge  which was partially offset by  in net fair value losses 
excluding these fair value and otti adjustments  our other operating income increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million the preceding year  due primarily to a million increase in mortgage banking revenue  a million increase in deposit fees and service charges and a million increase in miscellaneous other operating income 
other operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the prior year  largely as a result of decreased costs related to reo and fdic deposit insurance 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million one year earlier  primarily as a result of an increase in the net interest margin and despite a modest decrease in average interest earning assets 
the net interest margin of for the year ended december  increased basis points from the prior year  largely as a result of the effect of a much lower cost of deposits which more than offset a further decrease in asset yields 
while less severe than in the preceding year as a result of the significant reduction in problem assets  our net interest margin continued to be adversely affected by the level of nonaccrual loans and other non performing assets 
however  nonaccruing loans reduced the margin by just eight basis points during the year ended december   a meaningful improvement compared to a basis point reduction for the prior year 
in addition  the mix of earning assets changed to include fewer loans and more securities and interest bearing deposits as our on balance sheet liquidity remained high 
this continued shift in the mix during the still very low interest rate environment had a further adverse effect on earning asset yields 
reflecting generally lower market interest rates as well as changes in asset mix  the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  decreased by basis points compared to the prior year 
importantly  however  funding costs were also significantly lower  especially deposit costs which decreased basis points to from a year earlier  more than offsetting the decline in asset yields 
as a result  the net interest spread expanded to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year and was only partially offset by the decline in average interest earning assets 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest income occurred as a result of a million decrease in the average balance of interest earning assets  as well as a basis point decrease in the average yield on those assets 
the yield on average interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended december   compared to one year earlier  largely as a result of changes in the mix of assets and the impact of lower market rates on the loan and securities portfolios 
the federal reserve continued monetary policy actions during the year designed to maintain short term market interest rates at the extremely low levels of the past four years and initiated further actions to move intermediate and longer term rates even lower in despite the pressure from lower market interest rates  our loan yields were only modestly lower at for the year ended december  compared to in the preceding year largely because of a decrease in the amount of non performing loans 
looking forward  loan yields will likely continue to decline in the current interest rate environment as refinance activity will be reflective of market rates that are below the average portfolio yield and opportunities to further reduce the impact of non performing loans have diminished 
average loans receivable for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to billion  compared to billion for the prior year 
interest income on loans decreased by million  or  to million for the year from million for the year ended december   reflecting the decreased average balance and the lower average yield on loans 
the combined average balance of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  daily interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock increased by million excluding the effect of fair value adjustments for the year ended december   however the interest and dividend income from those investments decreased by  compared to the prior year 
the effect of the increased average balance was offset as the average yield on the securities portfolio and cash equivalents decreased to for the year ended december   from one year earlier 
the adverse impact of lower market rates on the combined yield on these investments was partially offset by changes in the mix to include lower balances of daily interest bearing deposits and more investment securities  however  yields on this portfolio should continue to decline in future periods given continuation of the currently low interest rate environment 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the sharp decline in interest expense occurred as a result of a basis point decrease in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december   from one year earlier  and a million  or  decrease in average interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in average interest bearing balances reflects a substantial decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit  as well as decreases in fhlb advances and other borrowings  which were only partially offset by increases in transaction and savings accounts 
the growth in non interest bearing deposits and other transaction and savings accounts during the past two years has significantly contributed to our improved net interest margin in deposit interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year as a result of a basis point decrease in the cost of deposits and a million decrease in the average balance of deposits 
average deposit balances decreased to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   while the average rate paid on deposit balances decreased to in the current year from for the prior year 
deposit costs are significantly affected by changes in the level of market interest rates  however  changes in the average rate paid for interest bearing deposits frequently tend to lag changes in market interest rates as evidenced by the continuing decline in our deposit costs despite relatively stable short term market interest rates over the past twelve months 
while we do not anticipate further reductions in market interest rates  we do expect additional modest declines in deposits costs over the near term as maturities of certificates of deposit will present further repricing opportunities and competitive pricing should remain restrained in response to modest loan demand in the current economic environment 
further  continuing changes in our deposit mix  especially growth in lower cost transaction and savings accounts  in particular non interest bearing deposits  have meaningfully contributed to the decrease in our funding costs compared to earlier periods  and should also result in lower deposit costs going forward 
average fhlb advances excluding the effect of fair value adjustments decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the decline in outstanding fhlb advances was almost entirely responsible for the  decrease in the related interest expense as the average rate paid on fhlb advances remained nearly unchanged for the years ended december  and at and  respectively 
other borrowings consist of retail repurchase agreements with customers secured by certain investment securities and  prior to march   the million of senior bank notes issued under the tlgp 
the senior bank notes had a fixed rate of  plus a guarantee fee  and matured on march  repaying these notes resulted in a significant reduction in the cost of borrowings for primarily as a result of repaying the senior bank notes  the average balance for other borrowings decreased million to million at december  compared to million a year earlier 
the rate on these other borrowings likewise decreased to from a year earlier and the related interest expense for other borrowings decreased by million to  for the year ended december   from million one year earlier 
junior subordinated debentures which were issued in connection with our trust preferred securities had an average balance excluding the effect of fair value adjustments of million for both the years ended december  and these junior subordinated debentures are adjustable rate instruments with repricing frequencies of three months based upon the three month libor index 
during  the average rate decreased to compared to for the lower average cost of the junior subordinated debentures in the current year was primarily the result of the expiration on february  of a five year fixed rate period on one debenture and its repricing from a fixed rate of to an adjustable rate of libor plus  or at december  table  analysis of net interest spread  presents  for the periods indicated  our condensed average balance sheet information  together with interest income and yields earned on average interest earning assets and interest expense and rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities

provision and allowance for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million  compared to million for the year ended december  as discussed in the summary of critical accounting policies section above and in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the provision and allowance for loan losses is one of the most critical accounting estimates included in our consolidated financial statements 
the provision for loan losses reflects the amount required to maintain the allowance for losses at an appropriate level based upon management s evaluation of the adequacy of general and specific loss reserves  trends in delinquencies and net charge offs and current economic conditions 
our provision for loan losses was substantially less in the year ended december  than in nonetheless  it remained elevated in relation to historical loss rates prior to the economic downturn  particularly during the first half of  in response to still high levels of delinquencies  non performing assets and net charge offs as well as diminished property values and uncertain economic conditions 
however  all of our asset quality indicators improved significantly throughout the years and  allowing us to decrease the level of provisioning as each year progressed 
reflecting lingering weakness in the economy and lower property values  during  we continued to provide for loan losses at a relatively high level and maintained a substantial allowance for loan losses at december  even though non performing loans and total loans outstanding declined 
although the allowance for loan losses at december  continued to reflect material levels of delinquencies and net charge offs for land and land development loans  our exposure to these types of loans was further reduced during the year as additional problem asset resolutions occurred 
the allowance for loan losses also continues to reflect our concerns that the significant number of distressed sellers in the market and additional expected lender foreclosures may further disrupt certain housing markets and adversely affect home prices and the demand for building lots 
these concerns have remained elevated during the past four years as price declines for housing and related lot and land markets have occurred in most areas of the puget sound and portland regions where a significant portion of our one to four family residential and construction and development loans are located 
nonetheless  more recently we have been encouraged by evidence of stabilization or modest improvement in certain markets in our service areas 
aside from housing related construction and development loans  non performing loans often reflect unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower  however  the weak pace of general economic activity and declining commercial real estate values have been significant contributing factors to more recent late cycle defaults in other non housing related segments of the portfolio 
we recorded net charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  and non performing loans decreased by million during the year to million at december   compared to million at december  a comparison of the allowance for loan losses at december  and reflects a decrease of million  or  to million at december   from million at december  included in our allowance at december  was an unallocated portion of million  which is based upon our evaluation of various factors that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans loans receivable excluding allowance for losses decreased to at december   compared to at december  however  as a result of the reduction in problem loans  the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans increased to at december   compared to a year earlier 
as of december   we had identified million of impaired loans 
impaired loans are comprised of loans on nonaccrual  tdrs that are performing under their restructured terms and loans that are days or more past due  but are still on accrual 
impaired loans may be evaluated for reserve purposes using either a specific impairment analysis or collectively evaluated as part of homogeneous pools 
for more information on these impaired loans  refer to note and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  was adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination

the remainder of the allocated and unallocated allowance for loan losses is established for the purpose of providing for estimated losses which are inherent in the loan portfolio 
other operating income 
other operating income  which includes changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value as well as non interest revenues from core operations  decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a million unfavorable variance in net fair value adjustments compared to the prior year 
excluding fair value and otti adjustments and  in the current year  a small gain on sale of securities  other operating income from core operations increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million at december   largely as a result of significantly increased revenues from mortgage banking 
mortgage banking revenues increased by million as increased production and sales of loans were supported by high levels of refinancing in the very low interest rate environment 
loan sales for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  importantly  and primarily as a result of growth in our customer base  income from deposit fees and other service charges increased by million  or approximately  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
by contrast  loan servicing fee income decreased  compared to the prior year  primarily reflecting a  impairment charge on our msrs 
miscellaneous revenues also increased significantly  largely as a result of increased fees associated with interest rate swaps and income on bank owned life insurance 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net charge of million for changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value  compared to a net charge of  for the year ended december  the adjustments in primarily reflect changes in the valuation of the junior subordinated debentures we have issued  which resulted in million in charges that were partially offset by net gains in the value of certain investment securities 
the net fair value loss in was also largely a result of changes in the valuation of the junior subordinated debentures  which resulted in million in charges that were partially offset by net gains in the values of certain investment securities 
additionally  in  we had a million recovery as a result of the full cash repayment of a trust preferred security issued by a commercial bank that had been written off as an otti charge in as discussed more thoroughly in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the valuation for many of these financial instruments has become very difficult and more subjective in recent periods as current and reliable observable transaction data does not exist 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year  largely as a result of decreased costs related to reo and fdic deposit insurance which were partially offset by increased compensation expenses 
while lower in than in  both years expenses reflect significant costs associated with problem loan collection activities including professional services and valuation charges related to reo  which we expect will decline in future periods as a result of the continuing reduction in non performing assets 
total reo expenses were million  including only  of net losses and valuation adjustments  for the year ended december   compared to million  including million of losses and valuation adjustments  for the year ended december  importantly  our total reo was reduced by nearly million during to million at december   compared to million a year earlier 
the cost of fdic insurance decreased by million compared to the prior year  largely as a result of the decrease in average deposit balances  leading to a decrease in average assets  and a reduction in the premium assessment rate 
compensation expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily reflecting salary and wage adjustments  increased mortgage banking activity and higher health insurance costs 
the increase in compensation costs was partially offset by an million increase in the amount of the credit for capitalized loan origination costs as a result of increased new loan originations and a million reduction in professional fees largely due to decreased legal expenses associated with problem loan resolution 
payment and card processing expenses increased by  reflecting the increased number of transaction accounts and increased customer usage of debit and credit cards 
all other expenses were only modestly changed from the prior year 
income taxes our normal  expected statutory income tax rate is  representing a blend of the statutory federal income tax rate of and apportioned effects of the oregon and idaho income tax rates 
however  during  we evaluated our net deferred tax asset and determined it was prudent to establish a valuation allowance against the entire asset 
while the full valuation allowance remained in effect  we did not recognize any tax expense or benefit in our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  we did not recognize any tax expense or benefit for the year ended december   although our pre tax net income was million 
during  we determined that maintaining the full valuation allowance was no longer appropriate and reversed all of the valuation allowance resulting in a substantial tax benefit for the year 
the reversal of the valuation allowance  net of adjustments to tax expense benefits  resulted in a net benefit from income taxes for the year ended december  of million 
beginning with the first quarter of  we expect to recognize income tax expense based upon the statutory rate noted above  although certain tax exempt income and tax credits likely will result in a slightly lower effective rate in future periods 
for more information on income taxes and deferred taxes  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and following three difficult years and despite a still challenging economy  banner corporation returned to profitability in while this return to profitability largely resulted from a material decrease in credit costs  particularly our provision for loan losses  it also reflected increased revenue generation from our core operations 
the decrease in credit costs reflected a substantially reduced level of non performing assets  while the increase in revenues was driven by significant improvement in our net interest income and deposit fees and other service charges fueled by growth in core deposits 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  which  after providing for the preferred stock dividend of million and related discount accretion of million  resulted in a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share 
this compared to a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
our results for also included an million provision for income taxes  despite a pre tax loss  as we recorded a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
by contrast  for the year ended december   we had pre tax net income of million  with the resulting provision for income taxes offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance 
aside from credit costs  our operating results depend largely on our net interest income which increased by million to million  primarily because of a significant reduction in deposit costs and a reduction in the adverse effect of non performing assets  and was the most important component of our growth in revenues from core operations in our operating results for the year ended december  also included an increase in other operating income  which was particularly influenced by a million recovery of a previous otti charge which was partially offset by a net loss of  as a result of changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value 
by comparison  for the year ended december   we recorded million of otti charges  which were partially offset by million in net fair value gains 
excluding these fair value and otti adjustments  our other operating income was nearly unchanged at million for the year ended december  compared to the preceding year  as increased deposit fees and other service charges were generally offset by decreased gains on the sale of loans from mortgage banking operations 
other operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the prior year  largely as a result of decreased costs related to reo and fdic deposit insurance 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan losses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million one year earlier  primarily as a result of an increase in the net interest margin and despite a modest decrease in average interest earning assets 
the net interest margin of for the year ended december  increased basis points from the prior year  largely as a result of the effect of a much lower cost of deposits which more than offset a further decrease in asset yields 
while less severe than in the preceding year as a result of the significant reduction in problem assets  our net interest margin continued to be adversely affected by the high level of nonaccrual loans and other non performing assets 
however  nonaccruing loans reduced the margin by basis points during the year ended december   compared to the basis point reduction for the prior year 
in addition  the mix of earning assets changed to include fewer loans and more securities and interest bearing deposits 
this continued shift in the mix in the low interest rate environment had a further adverse effect on earning asset yields 
reflecting generally lower market interest rates as well as changes in asset mix  the yield on earning assets for the year ended december  decreased by basis points compared to the prior year 
more importantly  funding costs were also significantly lower  especially deposit costs  which decreased basis points to from a year earlier  more than offsetting the decline in asset yields 
as a result  the net interest spread expanded to for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year and was only partially offset by the decline in average interest earning assets 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest income occurred as a result of a million decrease in the average balance of interest earning assets  as well as a basis point decrease in the average yield on those assets 
the yield on average interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended december   compared to one year earlier  largely as a result of changes in the mix of assets and the impact of lower market rates on the securities portfolio 
the federal reserve continued monetary policy actions during designed to maintain short term market interest rates at the extremely low levels of the previous three years and initiated further actions to move intermediate and longer term rates even lower in despite the pressure from lower market interest rates  our loan yields were only modestly lower at for the year ended december  compared to in the preceding year largely because of a decrease in the amount of non performing loans 
average loans receivable for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to billion  compared to billion for the prior year 
interest income on loans decreased by million  or  to million for the year from million for the year ended december   reflecting the decreased average balance and the lower average yield on loans 
the combined average balance of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  daily interest bearing deposits and fhlb stock increased by million excluding the effect of fair value adjustments for the year ended december   and the interest and dividend income from those investments increased by  compared to the prior year 
the effect of the increased average balance was nearly offset as the average yield on the securities portfolio and cash equivalents decreased to for the year ended december   from one year earlier 
the modest decrease in the combined yield on those investments  despite declining market interest rates  reflects a change in the mix to include lower balances of daily interest bearing deposits and more investment securities  primarily us government agency securities  which helped to offset the adverse impact of lower market rates 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year  a decrease of million  or 
the sharp decline in interest expense occurred as a result of a basis point decrease in the average cost of all interest bearing liabilities to for the year ended december   from one year earlier  and a million  or  decrease in average interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in average interest bearing balances reflects a substantial decrease in the average balance of certificates of deposit  as well as a decrease in fhlb advances and other borrowings  which were only partially offset by increases in transaction and savings accounts 
deposit interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year as a result of a basis point decrease in the cost of deposits despite a million decrease in the average balance of deposits 
average deposit balances decreased to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december   while the average rate paid on deposit balances decreased to in from for the prior year 
deposit costs are significantly affected by changes in the level of market interest rates  however  changes in the average rate paid for interest bearing deposits frequently tend to be less severe and to lag changes in market interest rates 
in addition  non interest bearing deposits dampen the effect of changes in market rates on our aggregate cost of deposits 
this lower degree of volatility and lag effect for deposit pricing have been evident in the continuing decrease in deposit costs as the federal reserve pursued policies beginning in first to aggressively lower short term interest rates and subsequently to maintain the very low level of interest rates 
furthermore  competitive pricing pressure for interest bearing deposits was quite intense for certain periods two to three years earlier  as many financial institutions experienced increased liquidity concerns in the deteriorating economic conditions 
however  as market rates remained low for an extended period  competitors liquidity strains were generally mitigated and certificates of deposit issued at those times reached maturity  we experienced significantly declining deposit costs during  and further  changes in our deposit mix  reflecting growth in lower cost transaction and savings accounts as a result of our branch network continuing to mature and the successful execution of targeted marketing strategies  also meaningfully contributed to the decrease in funding costs 
average fhlb advances excluding the effect of fair value adjustments decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the decline in outstanding fhlb advances was primarily responsible for a  decrease in the related interest expense as the average rate paid on fhlb advances remained nearly unchanged for the years ended december  and at and  respectively 
the average balance for other borrowings  consisting of customer retail repurchase agreements and senior bank notes  was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to the prior year  while the related interest expense for other borrowings decreased by  to million for the year ended december   from million one year earlier 
all of the decrease in average balance and interest expense was related to the retail repurchase agreements  as there was no change in the senior bank notes during the year ended december  as a result  the average rate paid on other borrowings increased eight basis points to for the year ended december   compared to one year earlier 
junior subordinated debentures had an average balance excluding the effect of fair value adjustments of million for both the years ended december  and the average rate decreased slightly to for compared to for with one exception  these junior subordinated debentures were adjustable rate instruments with repricing frequencies of three months based upon the three month libor index 
the slightly lower average cost of the junior subordinated debentures in reflects the relatively minor difference in the average three month libor rate for the two year period 
provision and allowance for loan losses 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was million  compared to million for the year ended december  while our provision for loan losses was substantially less in the year ended december  than in  it remained elevated in relation to historical loss rates prior to the economic downturn in response to still high levels of delinquencies  non performing assets and net charge offs as well as declining property values during the year 
however  all of our asset quality indicators improved significantly throughout  allowing us to decrease the level of provisioning as the year progressed and compared to the prior year 
although the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  continued to largely reflect material levels of delinquencies and net charge offs for construction  land and land development loans  our exposure to these types of loans was further reduced during as problem asset resolutions occurred 
the provision and allowance for loan losses also continued to reflect our concerns that the significant number of distressed sellers in the market and additional expected lender foreclosures might further disrupt certain housing markets and adversely affect home prices and the demand for building lots 
aside from housing related construction and development loans  non performing loans often reflect unique operating difficulties for the individual borrower  however  the weak pace of general economic activity and declining commercial real estate values significantly contributed to defaults in other non housing related segments of the portfolio 
we recorded net charge offs of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year  and non performing loans decreased by million during the year to million at december   compared to million at december   a comparison of the allowance for loan losses at december  and reflected a decrease of million  or  to million at december   from million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans loans receivable excluding allowance for losses decreased to at december   compared to at december  however  as a result of the reduction in problem loans  the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans increased to at december   compared to a year earlier 
other operating income 
other operating income  which includes changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value as well as non interest revenues from core operations  increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million recovery of a security that had been written off as an otti charge in the prior year  which was partially offset by a million unfavorable variance in net fair value adjustments compared to the prior year 
excluding fair value and otti adjustments  other operating income from core operations remained essentially unchanged at million for the years ended december  and  as increased deposit fees and other service charges were offset by decreased revenues from mortgage banking activity 
primarily as a result of growth in our customer base  income from deposit fees and other service charges increased by  or approximately  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
while our mortgage banking activity increased in the second half of  gain on sale of loans decreased by million to million for the full year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
loan sales for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  loan servicing fee income increased  compared to the prior year  reflecting an increase in the balance of loans serviced for others 
miscellaneous revenues also increased modestly  largely as a result of increased fees associated with interest rate swaps which were partially offset by lower returns on bank owned life insurance 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net charge of  for changes in the valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value  compared to a net gain of million for the year ended december  the adjustments in primarily reflect changes in the valuation of the junior subordinated debentures we have issued  which resulted in million in charges that were partially offset by net gains in the values of certain investment securities 
the net fair value gain in was largely a result of the impact of lower market interest rates on the valuation of certain fixed rate securities 
additionally  in  we had a million recovery as a result of the full cash repayment of a trust preferred security issued by a commercial bank that had been written off in for the year ended december   we had total otti charges of million  while in we did not experience any otti charges 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year  largely as a result of decreased costs related to reo and fdic deposit insurance which were partially offset by increased compensation expenses 
while lower in than in  both years expenses reflect significant charges related to reo operations  including holding costs  losses on sales and valuation adjustments on foreclosed properties 
total reo expenses were million  including million of losses and valuation adjustments  for the year ended december   compared to million  including million of losses and valuation adjustments  for the year ended december  importantly  however  our total reo was reduced by nearly million during to million at december   compared to million a year earlier 
the cost of fdic insurance decreased by million in  compared to the prior year  largely because of changes in the assessment formula mandated in the dodd frank act 
compensation increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily reflecting changes in salary levels and benefit costs 
the increase in compensation costs was partially offset by an  increase in the amount of the credit for capitalized loan origination costs as a result of increased new loan originations and a  reduction in occupancy and equipment expenses as a result of lower equipment and software depreciation and charges 
payment and card processing expenses increased by  primarily reflecting the increased number of transaction accounts and increased customer usage of debit and credit cards 
all other expenses were only modestly changed from the prior year 
income taxes 
our normal  expected statutory income tax rate is  representing a blend of the statutory federal income tax rate of and apportioned effects of the oregon and idaho income tax rates of and  respectively 
however  because of the full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset  there was no net provision for income taxes for the year ended december   although our pre tax net income was million 
for the year ended december   as a result of establishing the deferred tax valuation allowance  we recorded a net provision for income taxes of million despite having a pre tax loss of million  which resulted in an effective tax rate of negative 
during  we determined that it was prudent to provide a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
reasons for the determination included the negative evidence of three years of cumulative losses  the modest pace of economic recovery  and the continued difficulty in segments of the loan portfolio that put a near term return to profitability in question 
a valuation allowance was established during against the entire net deferred tax asset  reducing the balance  net of the allowance  to zero 
the valuation allowance was subsequently adjusted going forward for any changes in the net deferred tax asset  and the balance of our deferred tax asset  net of the allowance  continued to remain at zero on our balance sheet throughout for more information on deferred taxes  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
market risk and asset liability management our financial condition and operations are influenced significantly by general economic conditions  including the absolute level of interest rates as well as changes in interest rates and the slope of the yield curve 
our profitability is dependent to a large extent on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received from our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on our interest bearing liabilities 
our activities  like all financial institutions  inherently involve the assumption of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will have an adverse impact on the institution s earnings and underlying economic value 
interest rate risk is determined by the maturity and repricing characteristics of an institution s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
interest rate risk is measured by the variability of financial performance and economic value resulting from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk affecting our financial performance 
the greatest source of interest rate risk to us results from the mismatch of maturities or repricing intervals for rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
this mismatch or gap is generally characterized by a substantially shorter maturity structure for interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets  although our floating rate assets tend to be more immediately responsive to changes in market rates than most funding deposit liabilities 
additional interest rate risk results from mismatched repricing indices and formula basis risk and yield curve risk  and product caps and floors and early repayment or withdrawal provisions option risk  which may be contractual or market driven  that are generally more favorable to customers than to us 
an exception to this generalization is the beneficial effect of interest rate floors on a substantial portion of our performing floating rate loans  which help us maintain higher loan yields in periods when market interest rates decline significantly 
however  in a declining interest rate environment  as loans with floors are repaid they generally are replaced with new loans which have lower interest rate floors 
as of december   our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately billion and had a weighted average floor rate of 
an additional source of interest rate risk  which is currently of concern  is a prolonged period of exceptionally low market interest rates 
because interest bearing deposit costs have been reduced to nominal levels  there is very little possibility that they will be significantly further reduced 
by contrast  if market rates remain very low  loan and securities yields will likely continue to decline as longer term instruments mature or are repaid 
further  non interest bearing deposits provide a meaningful portion of our funding 
as a result  a prolonged period of very low interest rates will likely result in compression of our net interest margin 
while this pressure on the margin may be mitigated by further changes in the mix of assets and deposits  particularly increases in non interest bearing deposits  a prolonged period of low interest rates will present a very difficult operating environment for most banks  including us 
the principal objectives of asset liability management are to evaluate the interest rate risk exposure  to determine the level of risk appropriate given our operating environment  business plan strategies  performance objectives  capital and liquidity constraints  and asset and liability allocation alternatives  and to manage our interest rate risk consistent with regulatory guidelines and policies approved by the board of directors 
through such management  we seek to reduce the vulnerability of our earnings and capital position to changes in the level of interest rates 
our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability management committee  which is comprised of members of our senior management 
the committee closely monitors our interest sensitivity exposure  asset and liability allocation decisions  liquidity and capital positions  and local and national economic conditions and attempts to structure the loan and investment portfolios and funding sources to maximize earnings within acceptable risk tolerances 
sensitivity analysis our primary monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is asset liability simulation modeling  which is designed to capture the dynamics of balance sheet  interest rate and spread movements and to quantify variations in net interest income resulting from those movements under different rate environments 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in the modeled interest rate environments provides a measurement of interest rate risk 
we also utilize economic value analysis  which addresses changes in estimated net economic value of equity arising from changes in the level of interest rates 
the net economic value of equity is estimated by separately valuing our assets and liabilities under varying interest rate environments 
the extent to which assets gain or lose value in relation to the gains or losses of liability values under the various interest rate assumptions determines the sensitivity of net economic value to changes in interest rates and provides an additional measure of interest rate risk 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis performed by us incorporates beginning of the period rate  balance and maturity data  using various levels of aggregation of that data  as well as certain assumptions concerning the maturity  repricing  amortization and prepayment characteristics of loans and other interest earning assets and the repricing and withdrawal of deposits and other interest bearing liabilities into an asset liability computer simulation model 
we update and prepare simulation modeling at least quarterly for review by senior management and the directors 
we believe the data and assumptions are realistic representations of our portfolio and possible outcomes under the various interest rate scenarios 
nonetheless  the interest rate sensitivity of our net interest income and net economic value of equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
the following table sets forth as of december  and  the estimated changes in our net interest income over a one year time horizon and the estimated changes in economic value of equity based on the indicated interest rate environments dollars in thousands table interest rate risk indicators december  estimated increase decrease in change in basis points in interest rates net interest income next months economic value of equity december  estimated increase decrease in change in basis points in interest rates net interest income next months economic value of equity assumes an instantaneous and sustained uniform change in market interest rates at all maturities  however  no rates are allowed to go below zero 
the current federal funds rate is 
another although less reliable monitoring tool for assessing interest rate risk is gap analysis 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice  based upon certain assumptions  within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest sensitive assets 
generally  during a period of rising rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
certain shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of some borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a severe change in market rates 
table  interest sensitivity gap  presents our interest sensitivity gap between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  and the tables set forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which are anticipated by us  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future periods shown 
at december   total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year exceeded total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing in the same time period by million  representing a one year cumulative gap to total assets ratio of 
management is aware of the sources of interest rate risk and in its opinion actively monitors and manages it to the extent possible 
the interest rate risk indicators and interest sensitivity gaps as of december  and are within our internal policy guidelines and management considers that our current level of interest rate risk is reasonable 
the following tables provide a gap analysis as of december  and dollars in thousands table interest sensitivity gap december  within months after months within year after year within years after years within years after years within years over years total interest earning assets construction loans fixed rate mortgage loans adjustable rate mortgage loans fixed rate mortgage backed securities adjustable rate mortgage backed securities fixed rate commercial agricultural loans adjustable rate commercial agricultural loans consumer and other loans investment securities and interest earning deposits total rate sensitive assets interest bearing liabilities regular savings and interest bearing checking accounts money market deposit accounts certificates of deposit fhlb advances trust preferred securities retail repurchase agreements total rate sensitive liabilities excess deficiency of interest sensitive assets over interest sensitive liabilities cumulative excess deficiency of interest sensitive assets cumulative ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap to total assets ratio of cumulative gap to total assets footnotes follow table interest sensitivity gap continued december  within months after months within year after year within years after years within years after years within years over years total interest earning assets construction loans fixed rate mortgage loans adjustable rate mortgage loans fixed rate mortgage backed securities adjustable rate mortgage backed securities fixed rate commercial agricultural loans adjustable rate commercial agricultural loans consumer and other loans investment securities and interest earning deposits total rate sensitive assets interest bearing liabilities regular savings and interest bearing checking accounts money market deposit accounts certificates of deposit fhlb advances other borrowings trust preferred securities retail repurchase agreements total rate sensitive liabilities excess deficiency of interest sensitive assets over interest sensitive liabilities cumulative excess deficiency of interest sensitive assets cumulative ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap to total assets ratio of cumulative gap to total assets footnotes follow adjustable rate assets are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due to mature  and fixed rate assets are included in the period in which they are scheduled to be repaid based upon scheduled amortization  in each case adjusted to take into account estimated prepayments 
mortgage loans and other loans are not reduced for allowances for loan losses and non performing loans 
mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  other loans and investment securities are not adjusted for deferred fees and unamortized acquisition premiums and discounts 
adjustable rate liabilities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period they are due to mature 
although regular savings  demand  interest bearing checking  and money market deposit accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal  based on historical experience management considers a substantial amount of such accounts to be core deposits having significantly longer maturities 
for the purpose of the gap analysis  these accounts have been assigned decay rates to reflect their longer effective maturities 
if all of these accounts had been assumed to be short term  the one year cumulative gap of interest sensitive assets would have been million  or of total assets at december   and million  or  at december  interest bearing liabilities for this table exclude certain non interest bearing deposits that are included in the average balance calculations reflected in table  analysis of net interest spread 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  proceeds from loan principal and interest payments and sales of loans  and the maturity of and interest income on mortgage backed and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  competition and our pricing strategies 
our primary investing activity is the origination and purchase of loans and  to a lesser extent  the purchase of securities 
during the years ended december   and  we purchased loans of million  million and  respectively  while loan originations  net of repayments  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
this activity was funded primarily by sales of loans 
during the years ended december   and  we sold million  million  and million  respectively  of loans 
during the year ended december   deposits increased by million  despite a million decline in certificates of deposit  while during the years ended december  and  deposits decreased by million and million  respectively 
the increase in deposits in was the result of our increased marketing focus on retail deposits and our success in growing the number and dollar volume of core deposit accounts 
the decrease in deposits in the two previous years and in certificates of deposit in was driven by our pricing decisions designed to shift our deposit portfolio into lower cost checking  savings and money market accounts  and allow higher rate certificates of deposit to run off 
additionally  during we further reduced brokered deposits by million to just million at december  brokered deposits and public funds are generally more price sensitive than retail deposits and our use of those deposits varies significantly based upon our liquidity management strategies at any point in time 
fhlb advances excluding fair value adjustments decreased  million  and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and other borrowings at december  decreased million to million following a decrease of million in and a decrease of million in the decrease in other borrowings in the year ended december  was due to the million repayment of the senior bank notes issued under the tlgp and a decrease of million of retail repurchase agreements 
we must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to accommodate deposit withdrawals  to support loan growth  to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities 
during the years ended december   and  we used our sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments  purchase securities  add to our short term liquidity position and pay maturing savings certificates and deposit withdrawals 
at december   we had outstanding loan commitments totaling billion  including undisbursed loans in process and unused credit lines totaling million 
while representing potential growth in the loan portfolio and lending activities  this level of commitments is proportionally consistent with our historical experience and does not represent a departure from normal operations 
we generally maintain sufficient cash and readily marketable securities to meet short term liquidity needs  however  our primary liquidity management practice is to increase or decrease short term borrowings  including fhlb advances and federal reserve board borrowings 
we maintain credit facilities with the fhlb seattle  which at december  provide for advances that in the aggregate may equal the lesser of of banner bank s assets or adjusted qualifying collateral subject to a sufficient level of ownership of fhlb stock  up to a total possible credit line of million  and of islanders bank s assets or adjusted qualifying collateral  up to a total possible credit line of million 
advances under these credit facilities excluding fair value adjustments totaled million  or less than of our assets at december  in addition  banner bank has been approved for participation in the federal reserve bank s borrower in custody bic program 
under this program banner bank can borrow from up to of eligible loans  depending on collateral type and risk rating 
we currently estimate the federal reserve s bic program would provide additional borrowing capacity of million 
we had no funds borrowed from the federal reserve bank at december  or at december   certificates of deposit amounted to billion  or of our total deposits  including million which were scheduled to mature within one year 
certificates of deposit declined from of our total deposits at december   and of total deposits at december   reflecting our efforts to shift the portfolio mix into lower cost core deposits 
while no assurance can be given as to future periods  historically  we have been able to retain a significant amount of our deposits as they mature  although in and we intentionally encouraged certificates of deposit to decline 
management believes it has adequate resources and funding potential to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements 
in addition to the trust preferred securities we issued  our capital base is primarily comprised of common stock and paid in capital  which were reduced by an accumulated deficit largely as a result of goodwill impairment charges recorded in and net losses in and during  we received million when we issued our series a preferred stock and a related warrant to the treasury through its capital purchase program 
the series a preferred stock was repaid during and the warrant to purchase up to million in banner corporation common stock remains outstanding at december  during  the company completed a secondary offering of its common stock  resulting in net proceeds of million 
for additional information see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  during the years ended december   and  we issued shares of common stock through our drip  which resulted in net proceeds of million  million and million  respectively 
banner corporation has allocated a significant portion of these net proceeds to strengthen banner bank s regulatory capital ratios  however  at december   banner corporation had retained million in cash to be used for general corporate purposes 
capital requirements banner corporation is a bank holding company registered with the federal reserve 
bank holding companies are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the federal reserve under the bank holding company act of  as amended bhca  and the regulations of the federal reserve 
banner bank and islanders bank  as state chartered  federally insured commercial banks  are subject to the capital requirements established by the fdic 
the capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require banner corporation and the banks to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital 
the federal reserve requires banner corporation to maintain capital adequacy that generally parallels the fdic requirements 
the fdic requires the banks to maintain minimum ratios of tier total capital to risk weighted assets as well as tier leverage capital to average assets 
at december   banner corporation and the banks each exceeded all current regulatory capital requirements 
see item  business regulation  and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding banner corporation s and banner bank s regulatory capital requirements

well capitalized only applies to the banks 
effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the changes in relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
the following table shows the obligations of banner corporation and its subsidiaries  banner bank and islanders bank  as of december  by maturity in thousands table contractual obligations due in one year or less due in one to three years due in three to five years due in more than five years total advances from federal home loan bank junior subordinated debentures retail repurchase agreements operating lease obligations purchase obligation total at december   we had commitments to extend credit of billion 
in addition  we have contracts with various vendors to provide services  including information processing  for periods generally ranging from one to five years  for which our financial obligations are dependent upon acceptable performance by the vendor
