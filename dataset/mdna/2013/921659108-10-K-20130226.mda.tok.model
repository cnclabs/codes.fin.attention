item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k include historical information and other information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and contain forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under the risk factors section of this report and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of products for the treatment of central nervous system disorders 
we believe that each of our products and partnered products will address a large market with significant unmet medical needs by offering advantages over currently available therapies 
our product portfolio includes fanapt iloperidone  a compound for the treatment of schizophrenia  the oral formulation of which is currently being marketed and sold in the us by novartis pharma ag novartis  tasimelteon  a compound for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders crsd  which is currently in clinical development for the treatment of non  and vly  a small molecule neurokinin receptor nk r antagonist 
in december and january  we announced positive results for two phase iii studies for tasimelteon in the treatment of non hour disorder non 
the set phase iii study demonstrated that tasimelteon was able to entrain the master body clock as measured by melatonin and cortisol circadian rhythms 
tasimelteon was also shown to significantly improve clinical symptoms across a number of sleep and wake measures 
these results provided robust evidence of direct and clinically meaningful benefits to patients with non the reset phase iii study demonstrated the maintenance effect of milligrams mg of tasimelteon to entrain melatonin and cortisol circadian rhythms in individuals with non patients treated with tasimelteon maintained their clinical benefits while patients receiving placebo showed significant deterioration in measures of nighttime sleep  daytime naps and timing of sleep 
the tasimelteon non program continues towards its goal of a projected mid new drug application nda filing with the us food and drug administration fda 
we will meet with the fda in the first quarter of for a pre nda meeting on tasimelteon in the treatment of patients with non in january  vanda reported top line results of the phase iib iii clinical study magellan in major depressive disorder mdd  investigating the efficacy and safety of tasimelteon as a monotherapy in the treatment of patients with mdd 
the clinical study did not meet the primary endpoint of change from baseline in the hamilton depression scale hamd after weeks of treatment as compared to placebo 
as a result  all activities have been discontinued related to the mdd indication for tasimelteon 
we incurred million in research and development costs in directly attributable to our development of tasimelteon 
pursuant to the amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis  we received an upfront payment of million in and are eligible for additional payments totaling up to million upon novartis achievement of certain commercial and development milestones for fanapt in the us and canada 
based on the current sales performance of fanapt in the us and the decision by novartis to cease development of the long acting injectable or depot formulation of fanapt  we expect that some or all of these commercial and development milestones will not be achieved by novartis 
we also receive royalties  which  as a percentage of net sales  are in the low double digits  on net sales of fanapt in the us and canada 
we retain exclusive rights to fanapt outside the us and canada and we have exclusive rights to use any of novartis data for fanapt for developing and commercializing fanapt outside the us and canada 
we incurred million in research and development costs in directly attributable to our development of fanapt 
since we began our operations in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the in licensing and clinical development of our compounds 
our ability to generate additional revenues largely depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to complete the development of our products or product candidates to obtain the 
table of contents regulatory approvals for and manufacture  market and sell our products and product candidates and on novartis ability to successfully commercialize fanapt in the us the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on a number of factors  including risks related to our business  risks related to our industry  and other risks which are detailed in item a of part i of this annual report on form k  entitled risk factors 
revenues 
our revenues are derived primarily from our amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis and include an upfront payment  product sales and future milestone and royalty payments 
revenue is considered both realizable and earned when the following four conditions are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  iii delivery or performance has occurred and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue related to the million upfront payment is being recognized ratably on a straight line basis from the date the amended and restated sublicense agreement became effective november through the expected life of the us patent for fanapt which we expect to last until may this includes the hatch waxman extension that extends patent protection for drug compounds for a period of five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term hatch waxman extension and we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity 
we recognize revenue from fanapt royalties and commercial and development milestones from novartis when realizable and product revenue upon delivery of our products to novartis 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of fees for services provided by third parties in connection with the clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  milestone payments  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  costs for regulatory consultants and filings  depreciation of capital resources used to develop products  related facilities costs  and salaries  other employee related costs and stock based compensation for research and development personnel 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred for compounds in the development stage  including manufacturing costs and milestone payments made under license agreements prior to fda approval 
upon and subsequent to fda approval  manufacturing and milestone payments are capitalized 
milestone payments are accrued when it is deemed probable that the milestone event will be achieved 
costs related to the acquisition of intellectual property are expensed as incurred if the underlying technology is developed in connection with our research and development efforts and has no alternative future use 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our products and product candidates and pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise 
we incurred research and development expenses in the aggregate of million in including employee stock based compensation expense of million 
we expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we continue to develop our products and product candidates 
we expect to incur licensing costs in the future that could be substantial  as we continue our efforts to develop our products  product candidates and partnered products and to evaluate potential in license product candidates or compounds 

table of contents the following table summarizes our product development initiatives for  and  respectively 
included in this table are the research and development expenses recognized in connection with the clinical development of fanapt  tasimelteon and vly year ended december  in thousands direct project costs tasimelteon fanapt vly total direct product costs indirect project costs facility depreciation other indirect overhead costs total indirect expenses total research and development expenses many of our research and development costs are not attributable to any individual project because we share resources across several development projects 
we record direct costs  including personnel costs and related benefits and stock based compensation  on a project by project basis 
we record indirect costs that support a number of our research and development activities in the aggregate 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  other related costs for personnel  including employee stock based compensation  related to executive  finance  accounting  information technology  marketing  and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and fees for legal  accounting and other professional services 
general and administrative expenses also include third party expenses incurred to support business development  marketing and other business activities related to fanapt 
we incurred general and administrative expenses of million in  including employee stock based compensation expense of million 
other income 
other income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash and non recurring income expense transactions that are outside of our normal business operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies appears in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
however  we believe that the following accounting policies are important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and we have accordingly included them in this discussion 
accrued liabilities 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements we are required to estimate accrued liabilities 
the estimation of accrued liabilities involves identifying services that have been performed on 
table of contents our behalf  and then estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such services as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements 
accrued liabilities include professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants  contract service fees  such as those under contracts with clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  fees to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials  and fees for marketing and other commercialization activities 
pursuant to our assessment of the services that have been performed on clinical trials and other contracts  we recognize these expenses as the services are provided 
our assessments include  but are not limited to i an evaluation by the project manager of the work that has been completed during the period  ii measurement of progress prepared internally and or provided by the third party service provider  iii analyses of data that justify the progress  and iv our judgment 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
milestone payments are accrued when it is deemed probable that the milestone event will be achieved 
upon fda acceptance of an nda filing for tasimelteon  the company would be obligated to make milestone payments of million under regulatory consulting agreements and million under licensing agreements  respectively 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived primarily from our amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis and include an upfront payment  product revenue and future milestone and royalty revenues 
revenue related to the upfront payment is being recognized ratably from the date the amended and restated sublicense agreement became effective november through the expected life of the us patent for fanapt  which we expect to last until may this includes the hatch waxman extension that extends patent protection for drug compounds for a period of five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term hatch waxman extension and we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity 
we recognize revenue related to fanapt royalties and commercial and development milestones as they are realizable and earned  and product revenue upon delivery of our products to novartis 
our revenues have also been derived from grant revenue which is recognized when it is received 
employee stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
expected volatility rates are based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded common stock and other factors 
the weighted average expected term of stock options granted is based on the simplified method as the options meet the plain vanilla criteria required by authoritative guidance 
significant changes in the market price of the company s common stock in recent years has made historical data less reliable for the purpose of estimating future vesting  exercise  and employment behavior 
the simplified method provided a more reasonable approach for estimating the weighted average expected term for options granted in the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant 
we have not paid dividends to our stockholders since our inception other than a dividend of preferred share purchase rights which was declared in september and do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
employee stock based compensation expense for a period is also affected by the expected forfeiture rate for the respective option grants 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments or expected forfeitures are too high or too low  it would have the effect of overstating or understating expenses 

table of contents employee stock based compensation expense related to stock based awards for the years ended december   and  was comprised of the following year ended december  in thousands research and development general and administrative total employee stock based compensation expense the research and development portion of employee stock based compensation expense for was impacted by the termination of our chief medical officer in the third quarter of and the resulting reversal of employee stock based compensation expense resulting from the cancellation of certain of his outstanding equity awards 
income taxes 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to future projections of taxable income  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities and tax planning strategies 
settlement of filing positions that may be challenged by tax authorities could impact our income taxes in the year of resolution 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences becomes deductible or the net operating losses nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
when considering the reversal of the valuation allowance  we consider the level of past and future taxable income  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the utilization of the carryforwards and other factors 
revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the fact that we have historically generated nols serves as strong evidence that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
therefore  we have a full valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets as of december  recent accounting pronouncements there are no new accounting pronouncements that have had or that we expect will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including any possible payments made or received pursuant to license or collaboration agreements  progress of our research and development efforts  the timing and outcome of clinical trials and related possible regulatory approvals and our and our partners ability to successfully commercialize our products  product candidates and partnered products 
our limited operating history makes predictions of future operations difficult or impossible 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  included million recognized from novartis related to straight line recognition of upfront license fees and

clinical trials costs increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to costs related to the tasimelteon trials for the treatment of non in blind individuals without light perception and the tasimelteon trial for the treatment of mdd 
contract research and development  consulting  materials and other direct costs increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to costs related to the tasimelteon non and mdd trials  costs related to the preparation of a future tasimelteon new drug application nda filing with the fda and the initial license fee associated with vly salaries  benefits and related costs increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  due to new employees hired in and and the termination of our chief medical officer in the third quarter of and the severance costs associated with his termination 
employee stock based compensation expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  due to the termination of our chief medical officer in the third quarter of and the reversal of employee stock based compensation expense resulting from the cancellation of certain of his outstanding equity awards and a reduction in the amortization of employee stock based compensation expense from the lower fair value of equity awards granted during and compared to equity awards granted in prior periods

other expenses included lease exit costs and related accelerated depreciation in and a lease termination penalty in relating to our former headquarters lease in rockville  maryland 
other income 
other income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of a legal settlement related to a lawsuit filed against one of our stockholders partially offset by lower interest income 
while we did not participate in the lawsuit proceedings  we received a portion of the settlement 
tax provision benefit 
the tax benefit for the year ended december  was fully offset by a tax valuation allowance resulting from our assessment that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
the benefit for income taxes of million for the year ended december  is the result of the approval for a change in accounting method from the internal revenue service irs 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  included million recognized from novartis related to straight line recognition of upfront license fees and million in royalty revenue based on sales of fanapt

tax provision benefit 
the benefit for income taxes of million for the year ended december  is a result of the approval for a change in accounting method from the irs 
our effective tax rate of for the year ended december  was favorably impacted by the approval for a change in accounting method from the irs 
in addition  our tax rate was favorably impacted by the research and development and orphan drug credits 
intangible asset the following is a summary of our intangible asset as of december  estimated useful life years december  in thousands gross carrying amount accumulated amortization net carrying amount fanapt in may  we announced that the fda had approved the nda for fanapt 
as a result of the fda s approval of the nda  we met a milestone under our original sublicense agreement with novartis which required us to make a payment of million to novartis 
the million was capitalized and is being amortized over the remaining life of the us patent for fanapt  which we expect to last until may this includes the hatch waxman extension that provides patent protection for drug compounds for a period of five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term hatch waxman extension and we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity 
this term is our best estimate of the life of the patent  if  however  the pediatric extension is not granted  the intangible asset will be amortized over a shorter period 
we capitalized and began amortizing the asset immediately following the fda approval of the nda for fanapt 
the intangible asset is being amortized over its estimated useful economic life using the straight line method 
amortization expense was million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following table summarizes our intangible asset amortization schedule as of december  in thousands total after intangible asset 
table of contents deferred revenue the following is a summary of changes in total deferred revenue for the years ended december   and in thousands balance at beginning of year reductions from licensing revenue recognized balance at end of year year ended december  december  december  we entered into an amended and restated sublicense agreement with novartis in october  pursuant to which novartis has the right to commercialize and develop fanapt in the us and canada 
under the amended and restated sublicense agreement  we received an upfront payment of million in december we established a joint steering committee jsc with novartis following the effective date of the amended and restated sublicense agreement 
we concluded that the jsc constitutes a deliverable under the amended and restated sublicense agreement and that revenue related to the upfront payment will be recognized ratably over the term of the jsc  however  the delivery or performance has no term as the exact length of the jsc is undefined 
as a result  we deemed the performance period of the jsc to be the life of the us patent for fanapt  which we expect to last until may this includes the hatch waxman extension that provides patent protection for drug compounds for a period of five years to compensate for time spent in development and a six month pediatric term extension 
fanapt has qualified for the full five year patent term hatch waxman extension and we expect that fanapt will be eligible for six months of pediatric exclusivity 
this term is our best estimate of the life of the patent 
revenue related to the upfront payment will be recognized ratably from the date the amended and restated sublicense agreement became effective november through the expected life of the us patent for fanapt may 
for each of the years ended december   and  we recognized revenue of million for the license agreement 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were million compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents are deposits in operating accounts and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of days or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits  investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  and commercial paper of high quality corporate issuers 
our marketable securities consist of investments in government sponsored enterprises and commercial paper 

table of contents as of december  and  our liquidity resources are summarized as follows as of december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents marketable securities  current us treasury and government agencies corporate debt marketable securities  current marketable securities  non current us treasury and government agencies marketable securities  non current total as of december   we maintained all of our cash and cash equivalents in two financial institutions 
deposits held with these institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits  but we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such deposits 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  as we focus on clinical trials and manufacturing required for the development of our products 
the duration and cost of clinical trials are a function of numerous factors such as the number of patients to be enrolled in the trial  the amount of time it takes to enroll them  the length of time they must be treated and observed  and the number of clinical sites and countries for the trial 
in addition  orphan clinical trials create an additional challenge due to the limited number of available patients afflicted with the disease 
we must receive regulatory approval to launch any of our products commercially 
in order to receive such approval  the appropriate regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy and that our products and the manufacturing facilities meet all applicable regulatory requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to receive regulatory approval for any of our compounds or that our compounds and the manufacturing facilities will meet all applicable regulatory requirements 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  the costs to advance our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and may vary significantly 
we expect that our existing funds will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  primarily including the scope and costs of our clinical development programs  the scope and costs of our manufacturing and process development activities  the magnitude of our discovery and preclinical development programs and the level of our pre commercial launch activities 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing required in the future will be available on acceptable terms  if at all

contractual obligations and commitments the following is a summary of our non cancellable long term contractual cash obligations as of december  cash payments due by period in thousands total after operating leases this table does not include various agreements that we have entered into for services with third party vendors  including agreements to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates  and for consulting and other contracted services due to the cancelable nature of the services 
we accrued the costs of these agreements based on estimates of work completed to date 
this table does not include milestone payments that could be due under our agreement with a regulatory consultant we have engaged to assist in our efforts to prepare  file and obtain fda approval of an nda for tasimelteon 
as part of the engagement and subject to certain conditions  we could be obligated to make

this table does not include milestone payments that could be due under our license agreements 
under our license agreement with bristol myers squibb bms for the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize tasimelteon  we would be obligated to make future milestone payments to bms and massachusetts general hospital mgh of less than million in the aggregate the majority of which are tied to sales milestones 
in the event that a tasimelteon nda is accepted for filing by the fda  we will incur milestone obligations of million 
under our license agreement with eli lilly and company for the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize vly  we could be obligated to make future milestone payments of up to million for pre nda approval milestones and up to million for future regulatory approval and sales milestones 
operating leases our commitments related to operating leases represent the minimum annual payments for the operating lease for our headquarters located in washington  dc  which expires in and the lease exit liability for our former headquarters located in rockville  maryland  up to the lease termination date of june  in july  we entered into an office lease with square office owner llc the landlord for our current headquarters  consisting of  square feet at pennsylvania avenue  nw in washington  dc the lease 
under the lease  rent payments are abated for the first months 
the landlord provided us with a cash contribution of million for tenant improvements during the year ended december  subject to the prior rights of other tenants in the building  we have the right to renew the lease for five years following the expiration of its original term 
we also have the right to sublease or assign all or a portion of the premises  subject to standard conditions 
the lease may be terminated early by us or the landlord upon certain conditions

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant impact on the realized value of our investments
