business segments we operate two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
although the two operating segments have many similarities in their products  production processes  distribution methods  and 
table of contents regulatory environment  there are differences in most of these areas and distinct differences in their economic characteristics 
as a result  we consider these segments to be two distinct reportable segments 
wet seal 
wet seal is a junior apparel brand for girls who seek fashion apparel and accessories at affordable prices  with a target customer age range of to years old 
wet seal seeks to provide its customer base with a balance of trend right and fashion basic apparel and accessories that are budget friendly

we also maintain a web based store located at www 
ardenb 
com  offering arden b merchandise comparable to that carried in our stores  to customers over the internet 
our e commerce stores are designed to serve as an extension of the in store experience and offer an expanded selection of merchandise  with the goal of growing both e commerce and in store sales 
we continue to develop our wet seal and arden b websites to increase their effectiveness in marketing our brands 
we do not consider our web based business to be a distinct reportable segment 
the wet seal and arden b reportable segments include  in addition to data from their respective stores  data from their respective e commerce operations 
see note segment reporting  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for financial information regarding segment reporting  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
our stores wet seal stores average approximately  square feet in size and in fiscal had average sales per square foot of as of february   we operated wet seal stores 
arden b stores average approximately  square feet in size and in fiscal had average sales per square foot of as of february   we operated arden b stores 
during fiscal  we opened and closed wet seal stores and closed arden b stores 
as we continue to focus on turning around the wet seal business  we currently plan to open new wet seal stores primarily to replace the approximately to stores that will be closing upon lease expiration in fiscal  with openings primarily in outlet centers  in which we have experienced relatively strong sales productivity and profitability 
we currently plan to close approximately arden b stores in fiscal upon lease expiration  as we focus efforts on improving merchandising and marketing strategies in that business 
we have approximately existing wet seal store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal additionally  approximately of these leases expire in the last few days of fiscal  and we expect to remodel or relocate a portion of these wet seal stores during fiscal for the remaining expiring leases  we expect to negotiate new leases that will allow us to remain in all but a small number of these wet seal locations 
our ability to increase the number of wet seal stores in the future will depend  in part  on satisfactory cash flows from existing operations  the demand for our merchandise  and our ability to find suitable mall or other locations with acceptable sites and satisfactory lease terms  and general business conditions 
our management does not believe there are significant geographic constraints within the us on the locations of future stores 
competitive strengths experienced management team 
we believe our new chief executive officer  mr 
john d 
goodman  and other key members of our management team have the requisite experience and knowledge in the fast fashion retail apparel sector  which will be instrumental in managing our company through its transition back to a fast fashion strategy and driving our company in the next phase of its growth cycle

table of contents ms 
kim bajrech and ms 
debbie shinn  our svp general merchandise managers for the wet seal division  joined us in july  and both have a strong knowledge of fast fashion and a proven history of operating that model successfully at our company 
merchandising models at wet seal and arden b are focused on fashion at affordable prices  speed and flexibility 
at wet seal  we have developed considerable expertise in identifying  sourcing and selling a broad assortment of fast fashion apparel and accessories at competitive prices for our customers 
at arden b we continue to focus on offering unique fashion apparel and accessories for our young contemporary customers and have shifted the merchandising model over recent years to be quicker and more flexible 
additionally  arden b has been established as a preferred destination for dresses and other social occasion fashion needs for our customers 
our buyers work closely with senior management to evaluate the optimal merchandise assortments and promotion and pricing strategies 
a significant portion of our merchandise is sourced domestically or from domestic importers 
this sourcing strategy is intended to enable us to ship new merchandise to stores with a high frequency and to react quickly to changing fashion trends 
we also take regular markdowns with the objective of ensuring the rapid sale of slow moving inventory 
strong financial position 
in recent years  we have maintained strong levels of cash  cash equivalents and investments  extinguished our debt and repurchased a significant number of shares of our class a common stock 
through fiscal  million in principal amount of our convertible notes and million in face amount of our convertible preferred stock had been converted into shares of our class a common stock 
also  in fiscal    and  we repurchased million  million  million  and million shares of our class a common stock for million  million  million  and million  respectively  under our share repurchase programs and through tendering employee shares upon restricted share vesting for tax obligations 
we repurchased no common stock during fiscal as of february   our cash  cash equivalents and investments were million  with no debt  and our stockholders equity was million 
our strong balance sheet allows us the ability to execute on our current strategic initiatives and growth plans 
strategy as part of a strategic review of business operations  we have identified what we believe are significant opportunities to turnaround our recent business trends  drive sales productivity and merchandise margin  and grow our existing store base and e commerce business 
the key elements of our opportunities are to strengthen customer engagement and focus 
during fiscal  in conjunction with a mid strategic shift geared toward providing elevated product and a narrower assortment to an older target customer  we lost our focus on our previous core fast fashion customer at wet seal 
to regain our focus and strengthen our engagement with our core customer in both divisions  we have begun planning and implementing social media strategies highly focused on them 
we have also begun to identify other methods  including customer focus groups and ongoing panels  that will allow us to achieve frequent interaction with our customers in both divisions to gain insight into their fashion needs and lifestyles to allow us to better align our organizational goals and marketing efforts with them 
we have only recently begun many of these initiatives and will continue to further develop and refine them in fiscal re establish and strengthen our brands 
through intensified customer engagement and interaction  we will be informed of how customers perceive our brands and will react with initiatives to re establish and strengthen customer perception of our brands in both of our divisions 
during fiscal  we intend to first focus on offering trend right apparel and accessories that meet our customers fashion needs 
concurrently  we will focus on improving how we communicate with our customers  both in our stores and through e commerce  through playfully disruptive lease line marketing  improved visual merchandising  and targeted social media outreach  as well as through empowering our employees providing the information and training necessary to better understand and engage our customers 
through these efforts  we believe we can regain our customers attention and confidence in our brands 
improve merchandise margin 
in both our wet seal and arden b divisions  we intend to improve merchandise margin by focusing on growing key categories that are more profitable  establishing formal test and re order programs for portions of our fashion assortments  broadening our assortments to minimize category risks and providing our merchants with more flexibility to shift inventory into trending categories 
we plan to enhance our planned promotional strategies  more aggressively manage inventory  continue to improve our sourcing processes and expand and strengthen our sourcing base 
improve store operations and develop a selling culture 
we are improving customer service and strengthening customer engagement through the development of more precise labor scheduling tools to allow our store associates to focus more on our customers to increase store productivity and comparable store sales growth 
we intend to increase store productivity and efficiency through streamlined operational tasks and reduced non selling activities  and by providing our store 
table of contents associates with the key performance metrics needed to manage and build their business 
we also will perform more detailed analysis and monitoring to identify improvement opportunities for underperforming stores 
in addition  we intend to improve our employee selling skills through stronger partnerships with the merchandising organization in addition to new e learning training and development programs 
conservatively grow wet seal store base and position for future growth 
we plan to open new wet seal stores primarily to replace the approximately to stores that will be closing upon lease expiration in fiscal  with openings primarily in outlet centers  in which we have experienced relatively strong sales productivity and profitability 
additionally  during fiscal we plan to remodel or relocate approximately wet seal stores upon lease renewals 
as we open new wet seal stores  or remodel our existing wet seal stores  in fiscal  we intend to take advantage of favorable store construction costs for outlet centers and utilize elements of a refreshed store design that was developed in fiscal as part of a strategic planning process in fiscal  we intend to further refine our real estate strategy to focus on market by market growth targets  target malls and or other locations within those markets that best align with our core customer and brands 
we believe these efforts should position wet seal for store base growth beyond fiscal improve marketing 
we believe we have an opportunity to improve our marketing strategies and execution 
we intend to re direct our marketing investments at both wet seal and arden b in fiscal to more effectively focus on driving store and e commerce traffic and conversion and to re establish and strengthen our brands with our customers 
we also intend to continue to enhance our e commerce sites as marketing vehicles for our stores  including a broader utilization of social media  and to focus on direct marketing programs and improved in store visual merchandising 
realize comparable store sales growth opportunity 
we are focused on regaining sales productivity lost through our comparable stores sales declines experienced in fiscal and prior years  as a result of our unsuccessful strategy change in mid through fiscal and the challenging economic environment over the past several years 
sales productivity at both wet seal and arden b remains below historical peaks 
in fiscal  we will seek to achieve comparable store sales improvement through implementing strategies noted above  which  among other things  include strengthening customer engagement and focus  re establishing and strengthening our brands  improving merchandising  promotional and marketing practices  offering broader merchandise assortments and exploiting key merchandise category opportunities

continue to manage business conservatively in the near term through our turnaround 
we have taken many recent strategic actions intended to increase our financial strength during our turnaround and to position ourselves to capitalize on our company s growth and operating leverage opportunities when we have stabilized the business 
in concert with our turnaround efforts  our near term goals include preserving a strong balance sheet  improving existing sales trends  continuing conservative growth of our wet seal division store base only in channels that have proven to generate strong sales productivity and profitably  pursuing capital expenditure investments that are accretive or provide efficiencies to the business and maintaining clean and more productive inventory levels 
additionally  we intend to continue to identify opportunities to further leverage our planning and allocation and merchandising systems and our distribution center sorter system  and plan to continue to closely monitor inventory positions during fiscal  while seeking to have the appropriate inventory mix and levels in new trend opportunities 
improve arden b business 
beginning in fiscal  we significantly reduced the size and cost of the arden b merchandising organization  refined the product development and sourcing processes to include more partnering with merchandise suppliers  and adjusted our merchandise mix and pricing and promotional strategies 
the changes to the pricing and promotional strategies at arden b included significant reductions in price points across all categories 
in response to these changes  arden b experienced positive comparable store sales results and improved merchandise margins in fiscal  intermittent improvement in fiscal and early fiscal  and then decline in the business in latter fiscal that continued in fiscal we closed arden b stores in fiscal  and we plan to close approximately additional arden b stores in fiscal as we focus efforts on improving merchandising and marketing strategies in that brand 
we believe arden b has opportunity to generate more consistent financial growth and performance 
we aim to drive further sales and profitability improvement at arden b by better leveraging our distinctive dress business positioning into other product categories  maintaining our value pricing strategy  and continually improving the in store customer experience 
expand our e commerce business 
we stabilized our e commerce business in fiscal and began to see growth in the latter part of the year 
this stabilization was a result of employing several initiatives  including aligning our e commerce and store shopping experiences  employing multi channel marketing strategies  such as synergizing e commerce customer 
table of contents relationship management with our store loyalty programs  expanding e commerce only offerings in certain key merchandise categories  significantly growing our customer contact channels  and improving e commerce inventory planning and allocation practices 
these initiatives are ongoing 
we believe establishing consistent shopping and brand experiences between the e commerce and store channels is instrumental to driving growth in our multi channel customer base 
we believe this will lead to greater long term growth potential in our e commerce business and add more value from our e commerce channel as a marketing vehicle for our stores 
also  we continue to focus on and implement enhancements to our websites that will improve the customer experience 
buying our buying teams are responsible for quickly identifying evolving fashion trends and developing themes to guide our merchandising strategy 
each retail division has a separate buying team 
the merchandising teams for each division develop fashion themes and strategies by identifying trends and assessing how they best apply to our target customer  shopping appropriate domestic and international markets  using fashion services  and gathering references from industry publications 
the buying teams then work closely with vendors to use colors  materials  and designs that create images consistent with the themes for our product offerings 
since fiscal for our wet seal division  and beginning in fiscal for our arden b division  the majority of our merchandise is designed externally 
this allows us more flexibility to respond to the changing fashion trends of our target customers  to buy in smaller lots  and to reduce sourcing lead times 
see also allocation and distribution of merchandise below 
marketing  advertising  and promotion we believe that our brands are among our most important assets 
our ability to successfully increase brand awareness is dependent upon our ability to address the changing needs and priorities of each brand s target customers 
to that end  we focus many of our marketing efforts to better understand our customers and their needs and ensure we align our brand messages in our marketing  and the channels through which we deliver these messages  to our target customers 
we will also continue our emphasis on visual merchandising in our stores and e commerce sites  and in our direct marketing 
as discussed further in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  we also offer customer loyalty programs in both of our brands 
at wet seal  we offer a frequent buyer program in order to build loyalty to the brand  increase the frequency of visits  promote multiple item purchases  and gain direct access to the customer 
at arden b  we offer a loyalty program  b rewarded  designed for the same purposes as those of our wet seal division 
we intend to implement marketing strategies to build upon the past successes of these loyalty programs  synergize these programs with our e commerce customer relationship management efforts  and ensure they align with our brands for each division 
we also plan to more aggressively pursue customer acquisitions and to increase our use of e commerce marketing to drive increased store traffic 
during fiscal   and  we spent   and  respectively  of net sales on advertising 
in fiscal  our primary marketing focus was on visual merchandising  including in store promotion programs and events  and on e commerce 
we expect to decrease marketing and advertising spending modestly in fiscal  and re direct spend toward what we expect to be more effective marketing investments in support of our business strategies 
sourcing and vendor relationships we purchase our merchandise primarily from domestic vendors 
for fiscal  we directly imported approximately of our retail merchandising receipts from foreign vendors 
although in fiscal no single vendor provided more than of our merchandise  management believes we are one of the largest customers of many of our smaller vendors 
quality control is monitored and merchandise is inspected upon arrival at our foothill ranch  california facility 
we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any single supplier  and there are many vendors who could supply our merchandise 
allocation and distribution of merchandise our merchandising strategies depend heavily on maintaining a regular flow of fashionable merchandise into our stores 
successful execution depends largely on our integrated buying  planning  allocation  and distribution functions 
by working closely with store operations management and merchandise buyers  our teams of planners and allocators manage inventory levels and coordinate allocation of merchandise to each of our stores based on sales volume and store size  demographics  
table of contents climate  and other factors that may influence an individual store s product mix 
we utilize merchandise planning software that assists us in streamlining the planning process 
we also utilize size optimization software to support allocation of sizes to better align with each store s needs 
all merchandise is received from vendors at our foothill ranch  california distribution center  where items are inspected and prepared for shipping to our stores 
we ship merchandise to our stores by common carrier 
consistent with our goal of maintaining a regular flow of our product offerings  we frequently ship new merchandise to stores  and markdowns are taken regularly to ensure acceptable rates of sale of slow moving inventory 
we also utilize a markdown optimization system at our wet seal division to improve the speed of selling through slow product and improve merchandise margins 
marked down merchandise that remains unsold is either sent to select stores for deep discounting and sale  sent to our e commerce sites for sale  sold to an outside clearance company  or given to charity 
the fulfillment process and distribution of merchandise for our e commerce business is performed at our foothill ranch  california distribution center 
information and control systems our merchandise  financial  and store computer systems are integrated and operate using primarily oracle technology 
we maintain a large data warehouse that provides management  buyers  and planners comprehensive data that helps us identify emerging trends and manage inventories 
the core systems supporting our business are frequently enhanced to support strategic business initiatives 
our stores have a point of sale system operating on software provided by oracle 
this system facilitates bar coded ticket scanning  automatic price lookups  and centralized credit authorizations 
stores are networked to the corporate office via a centrally managed virtual private network 
we utilize a store portal intranet that is integrated with the corporate merchandise enterprise resource planning system to provide the stores and corporate staff with current information regarding sales  promotions  inventory  and shipments  and enables more efficient communications with the corporate office 
we utilize wide area networking hardware at our stores  which guards against security breaches to our stores point of sale system 
we also recently upgraded our merchandising systems 
in fiscal  in order to further improve gross margin through the use of technology  we completed implementation of oracle markdown optimization and sas size optimization systems for our wet seal business 
in fiscal  to maximize the benefits of size optimization  we completed installation of a distribution center automated sorter system to allow automated picking of customized size ranges for each store 
a major upgrade to the oracle retail merchandising system began in fiscal and was completed in early fiscal additionally  several enhancements and upgrades were completed in fiscal to the point of sale systems to create more efficiency within the store environment 
in fiscal  to improve our in store point of sale process  we replaced our aging psc scanners with new tablets in approximately wet seal stores and may decide to complete roll out of this technology to additional stores in we also completed several upgrades which included store routers  cisco equipment purchases and installation of a new storage area network 
seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending during september  historically accounting for a large percentage of our sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly less than of our annual sales 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
however  we began to experience cost pressures in the fourth quarter of fiscal and saw further cost increases through fiscal and most of fiscal  as a result of rising commodity prices  primarily for cotton  increased labor costs  due to labor shortages in china  from which a majority of our merchandise is sourced by our vendors  and increasing fuel costs 
although cotton prices have stabilized  the other sourcing cost pressures are expected to continue into fiscal the rising value of the currency in china relative to the us dollar may also have an impact on future product costs 
in response to the costs increases  we leverage our large vendor base to lower costs  are identifying new vendors and are assessing ongoing promotional strategies in efforts to maintain or improve upon historical merchandise margin levels 
we cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 

table of contents trademarks we own numerous trademarks  several of which are important to our business 
our primary and most significant trademarks and service marks are wet seal and arden b  which are registered in the united states patent and trademark office 
we also have registered  or have applications pending for  a number of other trademarks including  but not limited to  b

additionally  we have registered  or have pending applications for the following international trademarks including but not limited to  wet seal  blue asphalt  the wet seal  urban vibe  arden b  and contempo casuals 
in general  the registrations for these trademarks and service marks are renewable indefinitely as long as the marks are used as required under applicable regulations 
we are not aware of any significant adverse claims or infringement actions relating to our trademarks or service marks 
competition the women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location  and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores  and other apparel retailers  including abercrombie fitch  aeropostale  american eagle  anthropologie  banana republic  bcbg  bebe  body central  charlotte russe  express  forever  gap  guess  h m  nordstrom  old navy  pacific sunwear  rue  target  urban outfitters  zara  and other regional retailers 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
while we believe we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms  competition for prime locations within malls and power centers is intense  and we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain new locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 
customers our company s business is not dependent upon a single customer or small group of customers 
environmental matters we are not aware of any federal  state  or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position  or result in material capital expenditures 
however  we cannot predict the effect on our operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations 
during fiscal  we did not make any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated for fiscal government regulation our company is subject to various federal  state  and local laws affecting our business  including those relating to advertising  consumer protection  privacy  health care  tax  environmental and zoning and occupancy 
each of our company s stores must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which the store is located 
to date  our company has not been significantly affected by any difficulty  delay  or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals 
our company is also subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as employment and pay practices  overtime  and working conditions 
the bulk of our company employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to the federal and state minimum wages 
in the past  we have been assessed penalties or paid settlements to gain dismissal of lawsuits for noncompliance with certain of these laws  and future noncompliance could result in a material adverse effect on our company operations 
in july  may  september  may  and october  we were served with class action complaints alleging violations under certain state of california labor laws and on april   the us equal employment opportunity commission the eeoc requested information and records relevant to several charges of discrimination by us against our employees 
in november  we reached an agreement to settle the july class action complaint for approximately million 
in march  we paid million to settle the may class action complaint 
on february   the court of appeals issued a remittitur to send the september case back to the trial court where it will proceed on behalf of only the three named plaintiffs and not as a class action 
on september   the nlrb dismissed the plaintiffs claims for the may matter  however  the matter is still pending in state court and plaintiffs are appealing the court order granting our motion to compel arbitration 
on march   the court entered an order denying our motion to compel arbitration for the october class action complaint  and on september   we filed a notice of appeal 
on november   we reached resolution with the eeoc and several of the individual complainants that concludes the 
table of contents eeoc investigation 
between november and march  we paid approximately million to settle with individual complainants 
we also agreed to programmatic initiatives that are consistent with our diversity plan 
we will report progress on our initiatives and results periodically to the eeoc 
claimants with whom we did not enter into a settlement had an opportunity to bring a private lawsuit within ninety days from the date they received their november  right to sue notice from the eeoc  however  that time period is tolled for those individuals who are putative class members in a race discrimination class action filed on july  in the united states district court for the central district of california with respect to any race discrimination claims they have that are within the scope of the putative class action 
we continue to monitor our facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act  or the ada  in order to conform to its requirements 
under the ada  we could be required to expend funds to modify stores to better provide service to  or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of  disabled persons 
we believe that expenditures  if required  would not have a material adverse effect on our company s operations 
employees as of february   we had  employees  consisting of  full time employees and  part time employees 
full time personnel consisted of salaried employees and  hourly employees 
all part time personnel are hourly employees 
of all employees   were sales personnel and were administrative and distribution center personnel 
personnel at all levels of store operations are provided various opportunities for cash and or other incentives based upon various individual store sales and other performance targets 
all of our employees are nonunion and  in management s opinion  are paid competitively at current industry standards 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
item a 
risk factors risks related to our business general economic conditions  perceptions of such conditions by our customers and the impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending have adversely impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so 
our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending 
consumer purchases of discretionary items  including our merchandise  generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty 
as a result of recent increases in payroll taxes and increasing fuel costs  disposable income has decreased  which may lead to a decrease in demand for our merchandise 
in addition  continued difficult economic conditions may impact many facets of our operations  including  among other things  the ability of one or more of our vendors to deliver their merchandise in a timely manner or otherwise meet their obligations to us 
if pressures on disposable income and poor economic conditions in the us and world economic markets continue  or if they deteriorate further  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may continue to experience declines in comparable store sales in our wet seal division  and there can be no guarantee that the strategic initiatives we are implementing to improve our results will be successful 
during fiscal our comparable store sales declined by in our wet seal division 
we have taken steps to return to our core expertise of fast fashion merchandising which long supported our success in the past in the wet seal division 
however  there can be no guarantee that our financial results will improve and  if they do  there can be no guarantee as to the timing  duration or significance of such improvement 
we have experienced poor comparable store sales and operating results in our arden b division  and we cannot assure that we will be able to re establish and sustain improvements in the future 
in fiscal and  we experienced weak comparable same store sales and operating results in the arden b division due to not having the appropriate inventory levels in key performing categories and fashion content weakness 
we began to see improvement in january there can be no guarantee that our efforts to improve results will be successful and that the financial performance of our arden b division will improve 
we have experienced losses and relied on our cash reserves to fund our operations and implement our strategic growth plans 
if we are unable to improve cash flow from operations or obtain additional capital to meet our liquidity and capital resource requirements and pursue our growth strategy  our business may be adversely affected 
in recent years  we have maintained strong levels of cash  cash equivalents and investments and extinguished our debt 
however  in fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million and negative cash flow from operations of million 
if we continue to experience negative cash flow from operations  we will need to continue to rely on our cash reserves to fund our 
table of contents business or seek additional capital 
there can be no assurance that any such capital would be available to us 
accordingly  if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures  and our cash reserves are depleted  we may need to take various actions  such as down sizing and or eliminating certain operations  which could include exit costs  or reducing or delaying capital expenditures  strategic investments or other actions  and our business may be adversely affected 
if we are unable to anticipate and react to new fashion and product demand trends  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we rely on a limited demographic customer base for a large percentage of our sales 
our brand image is dependent upon our ability to anticipate  identify and provide fresh inventory reflecting current fashion trends 
furthermore  the continued difficult economic conditions make it increasingly difficult for us to accurately predict product demand trends 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately or in a timely manner to these fashion and product demand trends  we could experience reduced consumer acceptance of our products  a diminished brand image and higher markdowns 
these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if we decrease the price that we charge for our products or offer extensive  continued promotions on our products  we may earn lower gross margins and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
the prices that we are able to charge for our products depend on  among other things  the type of product offered  the consumer response to the product and the prices charged by our competitors 
to the extent that we are forced to lower our prices  our gross margins will be lower and our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
we have recorded asset impairment charges in the past and we may record material asset impairment charges in the future 
quarterly  we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets is not recoverable  we will be required to record impairment charges relating to those assets 
for example  our assessments during fiscal indicated that operating losses or insufficient operating income existed at certain retail stores  with a projection that the operating losses or insufficient operating income for those locations would continue 
as such  we recorded non cash charges of million during fiscal within asset impairment in the consolidated statements of operations to write down the carrying values of these stores long lived assets to their estimated fair values 
our quarterly evaluation of store assets includes consideration of current and historical performance and projections of future profitability 
the profitability projections rely upon estimates made by us  including store level sales  gross margins  and direct expenses  and  by their nature  include judgments about how current strategic initiatives will impact future performance 
if we are not able to achieve the projected key financial metrics for any reason  including because any of the strategic initiatives being implemented do not result in significant improvements in our current financial performance trend  we would incur additional impairment of assets in the future 
in the event we record additional impairment charges  this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may face risks associated with the transition of our senior management  newly appointed chief executive officer and our new board of directors 
in general  our success depends to a significant extent on the performance of our senior management  particularly personnel engaged in merchandising and store operations  and on our ability to identify  hire and retain additional key management personnel 
we have had significant changes in management in the beginning of fiscal and during fiscal   and  and these changes may impact our ability to execute our business strategy 
on july   our previous chief executive officer was terminated 
on october   our previous executive vice president and chief merchandise officer of our wet seal division resigned from our company 
on february   our previous president and chief operating officer resigned from our company 
on february   our previous senior vice president of store operations resigned from our company 
effective january   we appointed mr 
john d 
goodman as our new chief executive officer 
while mr 
goodman immediately became involved in the day to day activities of our company  we anticipate that we will experience a transition period before he is fully integrated into the organization 
during this transition period  we may experience a disruption to our customer relationships  employee morale and or business 

table of contents in addition  our recent appointment of six new members to our board and the resulting transition and integration of these individuals may impact our ability to execute our business strategy in the near term 
on september   we appointed two new directors to our board  ms 
kathy bronstein and mr 
john d 
goodman  who subsequently was appointed our chief executive officer  as noted above 
on october   we entered into an agreement settlement agreement with clinton group  inc cgi  for the purpose of resolving a pending consent solicitation and effecting an orderly change in the composition of our board 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  four of the members of our board resigned  mr 
harold kahn  mr 
jonathan duskin  mr 
sidney horn and mr 
henry winterstern  and four new directors  ms 
dorrit bern  ms 
lynda davey  ms 
mindy meads and mr 
john mills  were appointed as directors of the board to fill the four vacancies created by the resignations 
while all of the recently appointed directors have become immediately engaged in our business  we expect that we will continue to experience a transition period until they are fully integrated into their roles 
we cannot provide any assurance that there will not be any disruption that adversely impacts our business during such transition period 
our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders 
over the last few years  proxy contests and other forms of stockholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies in retail businesses  including us 
as noted in the preceding risk factor  in  we were engaged in a proxy contest with cgi which resulted in our entering into the settlement agreement and appointing four new directors to fill vacancies created by director resignations  and led to a significant increase in our operating expenses  which contributed to our net loss in fiscal although the proxy contest was settled  we could become engaged in another proxy contest  or experience other stockholder activism  in the future 
for example  on february   cgi delivered a letter to our board of directors expressing appreciation for recent measures implemented by the board  but suggesting the return of additional capital to the company stockholders via a dutch auction share repurchase program 
our board considered cgi suggestion and advised cgi that it believed that our existing strategies and plans were prudent and in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
if stockholder activism continues or increases  particularly with respect to matters which our board of directors  in exercising their fiduciary duties  disagree with or have determined not to pursue  our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time consuming  disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management  and perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities  and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel  business partners and customers 
in addition  if faced with another proxy contest  we may not be able to respond successfully to the contest or dispute  which would be disruptive to our business 
even if we are successful  if individuals are elected to our board with a differing agenda  our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders may be adversely affected 
these actions could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility 
our company ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping centers in which many of our stores are located 
substantially all of our stores are located in regional mall shopping centers 
factors beyond our control impact mall traffic  such as general economic conditions and consumer spending levels 
consumer spending and mall traffic remain depressed due to the continued difficult economic conditions 
as a result  mall operators have been facing increasing operational and financial difficulties 
the increasing inability of mall anchor tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic around our stores  the increasing inability of mall operators to attract anchor tenants and maintain viable operations and the increasing departures of existing anchor and other mall tenants due to declines in the sales volume and in the popularity of certain malls as shopping destinations  have reduced and may continue to reduce our sales volume and  consequently  adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to procure merchandise could be adversely affected by changes in our vendors factoring arrangements 
changes in our vendors factoring arrangements may threaten the factors financial viability and ability to provide factoring services to its customers 
although we do not have a direct relationship with factors  a portion of our vendors who supply our company with merchandise have direct factoring arrangements 
vendors who engage in factoring transactions will typically sell their accounts receivable to a factor at a discount in exchange for cash payments  which can be used to finance the business and operations of the vendors 

table of contents if the financial condition of our vendors factors were to deteriorate and certain of our vendors were unable to procure alternative factoring arrangements from competitors of their factor on the same or substantially similar terms  our ability to timely procure merchandise for our stores could be adversely affected 
this could require the devotion of significant time and attention by our management to adequately resolve such matters 
in turn  our results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal or state income tax purposes is subject to limitations 
we believe that our net operating losses nols are a valuable asset and we intend to take actions to protect the value of our nols 
however  section of the internal revenue code section contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal net operating loss carryforwards to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in our stockholders ownership interests in our company 
under section  potential limitations on nols are triggered when there has been an ownership change generally defined as a greater than change by value in our stock ownership over a three year period 
we incurred ownership changes in april and december  which resulted in section limitations applying to nols generated prior to those dates  which were approximately million 
despite these ownership changes  we may utilize all of our million of nols as of february   to offset future taxable income 
future transactions involving the sale or other transfer of our stock may result in additional ownership changes for purposes of section the occurrence of such additional ownership changes could limit our ability to utilize our remaining nols and possibly other tax attributes 
limitations imposed on our ability to use nols and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income could cause us to pay us federal income taxes earlier than we otherwise would if such limitations were not in effect 
any further ownership change also could cause such nols and other tax attributes to expire unused  thereby reducing or eliminating the benefit of such nols and other tax attributes to us and adversely affecting our future cash flows 
in addition  we may determine that varying state laws with respect to nol utilization may result in lower limits  or an inability to utilize nols in some states altogether  which could result in us incurring additional state income taxes 
during fiscal  the state of california passed legislation that suspended our ability to utilize nols to offset taxable income in fiscal and in late  the state of california extended such legislation  which further suspended use of nols to fiscal and as a result  we incurred additional cash state income taxes in california 
in the event that state law results in lower limits  or an inability to utilize loss carryforwards  or we become subject to federal alternative minimum tax  this could adversely affect our future cash flows 
we may suffer negative publicity and our business may be harmed if we need to recall any products we sell 
each of our wet seal and arden b divisions has in the past needed to  and may in the future need to  recall products that we determine may present safety issues 
if products we sell have safety problems of which we are not aware  or if we or the consumer product safety commission recall a product sold in our stores  we may suffer negative publicity and  potentially  product liability lawsuits  which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation  financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 
if we are unable to pass through increases in raw material  labor and energy costs to our customers through price increases  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our product costs rise from time to time due to increasing commodity prices  primarily for cotton  as well as due to higher production labor and energy costs 
we may not be able to  or may elect not to  pass these increases on to our customers through price increases  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon a single center for our corporate offices and distribution activities  and any significant disruption in the operation of this center could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
our corporate offices and the distribution functions for all of our stores and e commerce business are handled from a single  leased facility in foothill ranch  california 
in general  this area of california is subject to earthquakes and wildfires 
any significant interruption in the operation of this facility due to a natural disaster  arson  accident  system failure or other unforeseen event could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and  consequently  lead to a decrease in sales 
furthermore  we have little experience operating essential functions away from our main corporate offices and are uncertain what effect operating satellite facilities might have on our business  personnel and results of operations 
the financial 
table of contents losses incurred may exceed our insurance for earthquake damages and business interruption costs related to any such disruption 
as a result  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in our revenues for the back to school season in the third fiscal quarter and the holiday season in the fourth fiscal quarter have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues  with a disproportionate amount of our revenues being generated in the third fiscal quarter back to school season  which begins the last week of july and ends during september  and the fourth fiscal quarter holiday season 
in addition  any factors that harm our third and fourth fiscal quarter operating results  including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions  could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year 
in order to prepare for our peak shopping seasons  we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry at other times of the year 
an unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown  which could reduce our net sales and gross profit 
alternatively  an unanticipated increase in demand for certain of our products could leave us unable to fulfill customer demand and result in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors  including the merchandise mix and the timing and level of inventory markdowns 
as a result  historical period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future period to period results 
reliance should not be placed on the results of a single fiscal quarter  particularly the third fiscal quarter back to school season or fourth fiscal quarter holiday season  as an indication of our annual results or our future performance 
extreme or unseasonable weather conditions could adversely affect our business 
extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business 
for example  frequent or unusually heavy snowfall  ice storms  rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability 
our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions 
for example  extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions 
reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions could adversely affect our business 
our failure to effectively compete with other retailers for sales and locations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the women retail apparel industry is highly competitive  with fashion  quality  price  location and service being the principal competitive factors 
our wet seal and arden b stores compete with specialty apparel retailers  department stores and certain other apparel retailers  including abercrombie fitch  aeropostale  american eagle  anthropologie  banana republic  bcbg  bebe  body central  charlotte russe  express  forever  gap  guess  h m  macy  nordstrom  old navy  pacific sunwear  rue  target  urban outfitters  zara  and other regional retailers 
many of our competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
we face a variety of competitive challenges  including anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands  maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in narrowly defined market segments  sourcing innovative  high quality products in sizes  colors and styles that appeal to consumers in our target markets and maintaining a sufficient quantity of these items for which there is the greatest demand  obtaining favorable site locations within malls on reasonable terms  sourcing merchandise efficiently  pricing our products competitively and achieving customer perception of value  offering attractive promotional incentives while maintaining profit margins  and withstanding periodic downturns in the apparel industry 
our industry has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace 
any of these factors could result in reductions in sales or the prices of our products which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents in fiscal  we currently plan to open new wet seal stores primarily to replace the approximately to stores that will be closing upon lease expiration in fiscal  with openings primarily in outlet centers  in which we have experienced relatively strong sales productivity and profitability 
we currently plan to close approximately arden b stores in fiscal upon lease expiration  as we focus efforts on improving merchandising and marketing strategies in that business 
while we compete effectively for favorable site locations and lease terms  competition for prime locations within malls and outlet centers  in particular  and within other locations is intense and we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain new locations on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  actions of our competitors  particularly increased promotional activity  can negatively impact our business 
in light of the continued difficult economic conditions  pricing is a significant driver of consumer choice in our industry and we regularly engage in price competition  particularly through our promotional programs 
to the extent that our competitors lower prices  through increased promotional activity or otherwise  our ability to maintain gross profit margins and sales levels may be negatively impacted 
there can be no assurance that our competitors increased promotional activity will not negatively impact our business 
the upcoming expiration of leases for approximately of our wet seal and arden b existing stores could lead to increased costs associated with renegotiating our leases and or relocating our stores 
we have approximately existing store leases scheduled to expire in fiscal in connection with the expiration of these leases  we will have to renegotiate new leases  which could result in higher rental amounts for each store 
we may not be able to obtain new lease terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  as a result of renewal negotiations  we may be required by the landlord to remodel as a condition for renewal  which could result in significant capital expenditures 
in addition  some landlords may refuse to renew our leases due to our lower sales per square foot as compared with other prospective tenants 
if we are unable to agree to new terms with our landlords  we will have to close or relocate these stores  which could result in a significant expenditure and could lead to an interruption in the operation of our business at the affected stores  and we could be required to relocate to less desirable locations or may not be able to find viable locations at all 
our computer hardware and software systems are vital to the efficient operation of our retail and web based stores  and damage to these systems could harm our business 
we rely on our computer hardware and software systems for the efficient operation of our retail and web based stores 
our information systems provide our management with real time inventory  sales and cost information that is essential to the operation of our business 
due to our number of stores  geographic diversity and other factors  we would be unable to generate this information in a timely and accurate manner in the event our hardware or software systems were unavailable 
these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of factors  including earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters and power loss  computer systems failure  security breaches  and internet  telecommunications or data network failure 
a significant information systems failure could reduce the quality or quantity of operating data available to our management 
if this information were unavailable for any extended period of time  our management would be unable to efficiently run our business  which would result in a reduction in our net sales 
a cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a cyberattack may bypass the security for our information systems  causing an information system security breach and leading to a material disruption of our information systems  the loss of business information and or the loss of e commerce sales 
such a cyberattack could result in any of the following theft  destruction  loss  misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property  operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of our information systems and subsequent clean up and mitigation activities  negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers  partners or industry peers  and loss of sales generated through our internet websites through which we sell merchandise to customers to the extent these websites are affected by a cyberattack 
as a result  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
government regulation of the internet and e commerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business 

table of contents we are subject to general business regulations and laws  as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and e commerce 
existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of our internet or e commerce services 
these regulations and laws may cover taxation  privacy  data protection  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  mobile communications  electronic contracts and other communications  consumer protection  the provision of e commerce payment services  unencumbered internet communications  consumer protection  the provision of e commerce payment services  unencumbered internet access to our services  the design and operation of websites and the characteristics and quality of products and services 
it is not clear how certain existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  libel and personal privacy apply to the internet and e commerce 
unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our costs of doing business 
if we fail to comply with payment card industry data security standards  we may be subject to fines or penalties  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are highly dependent on the use of credit cards to complete sale transactions in our stores and through our websites 
if we fail to comply with payment card industry data security standards  we may become subject to fines or limitations on our ability to accept credit cards 
through our sale transactions  loyalty programs and other methods  we may obtain information about our customers which is subject to federal and state privacy laws 
these laws and the judicial interpretation of such laws are constantly evolving 
if we fail to comply with these laws  we may be subject to fines or penalties  which could impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability or failure to protect our intellectual property or our infringement of other intellectual property could have a negative impact on our operating results 
our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position 
we have registered trademarks for wet seal and arden b which are registered in the retail store services and other classes 
we take actions to establish and protect our intellectual property 
however  others may infringe on our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  we may lose market share to our competitors  the value of our brands could be diminished and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are also subject to the risk that claims will be brought against us for infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties  seeking to block the sale of our products as violative of their intellectual property rights or payment of monetary amounts 
in particular  we are subject to copyright infringement claims for which we may not be entitled to indemnification from our suppliers 
in addition  in recent years  companies in the retail industry  including us  have been subject to patent infringement claims from non practicing entities  or patent trolls 
any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us  whether or not it has merit  could be time consuming and result in costly litigation 
as a result  any such claim  or the combination of multiple claims  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are required to stop using any of our registered or nonregistered trademarks  our sales could decline and  consequently  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
covenants contained in agreements governing our senior credit facility restrict the manner in which we conduct our business  under certain circumstances  and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  growth prospects and ability to procure merchandise for our stores 
our senior revolving credit facility contains covenants that restrict the manner in which we conduct our business under certain circumstances 
subject to certain exceptions  these covenants restrict or limit our ability to  among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness  make certain investments or acquisitions  merge  consolidate  dissolve or liquidate  engage in certain asset sales including the sale of stock  repurchase stock  grant liens on assets  pay dividends  and close stores 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing our existing indebtedness  acceleration of any amounts then outstanding  the foreclosure upon collateral securing the debt obligations  or the unavailability of the line of credit 

table of contents we do not authenticate the license rights of our suppliers 
we purchase merchandise from a number of vendors who purport to hold manufacturing and distribution rights under the terms of license agreements or that assert that their products are not subject to any restrictions as to distribution 
we generally rely upon each vendor representation concerning those manufacturing and distribution rights and do not independently verify whether each vendor legally holds adequate rights to the licensed properties they are manufacturing or distributing 
if we acquire unlicensed merchandise or merchandise violating a registered trademark  we could be obligated to remove it from our stores  incur costs associated with destruction of the merchandise if the vendor is unwilling or unable to reimburse us and be subject to civil and criminal liability 
the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
we are subject to risks associated with our procurement of products from non us based vendors and non us vendors that purchase products internationally  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the majority of our products are manufactured outside the us and are primarily bought by us within the us from domestic importers 
as a result  we are susceptible to greater losses as a result of a number of risks inherent in doing business in international markets and from a number of factors beyond our control  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
these factors include import or trade restrictions including increased tariffs  customs duties  taxes or quotas imposed by the us government in respect of the foreign countries in which our products are currently manufactured or any of the countries in which our products may be manufactured in the future  political instability or acts of terrorism  significant fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  restrictions on the transfer of funds between the us and foreign jurisdictions and or potential disruption of imports due to labor disputes at us ports  any of which could adversely affect our merchandise flow and  consequently  cause our sales to decline  and local business practices that do not conform to our legal or ethical guidelines 
the us and the countries in which our products are produced or sold may also  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  or adversely adjust prevailing quota  duty or tariff levels 
in addition  none of our international suppliers or international manufacturers supplies or manufactures our products exclusively 
as a result  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers and import quota capacity 
if we were unable to obtain our raw materials and finished apparel from the countries where we wish to purchase them  either because room under the necessary quotas was unavailable or for any other reason  or if the cost of doing so should increase  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
violation of labor laws and practices by our suppliers could harm our business and results of operations 
our company policy is to use only those sourcing agents and independent manufacturers who operate in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the violation of laws  particularly labor laws  by an independent manufacturer  or by one of the sourcing agents  or the divergence of an independent manufacturer or sourcing agent labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the us or in the country in which the manufacturing facility is located  and the public revelation of those illegal or unethical practices  could cause significant damage to our company reputation and could subject the company to legal proceedings and or prohibit the company from selling product received from an accused vendor 
although our manufacturer operating guidelines promote ethical business practices  we do not control the business and operations of the manufacturers and cannot guarantee their legal and regulatory compliance 
we are exposed to business risks as a result of our e commerce operations 
we operate e commerce stores at www 
wetseal 
com and www 
ardenb 
com 
our e commerce operations are subject to numerous risks  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers  system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems 
specific risks include i diversion of sales from our stores  ii rapid technological change  iii liability for e commerce content  and iv risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the websites and their related support systems  including computer viruses  telecommunication failures and electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
in addition  internet operations involve risks which are beyond our control that could have a direct material adverse effect on our operational results  including i price competition involving the items we intend to sell  ii the entry of our vendors into the internet business in direct competition with us  iii the level of merchandise 
table of contents returns experienced by us  iv governmental regulation  v e commerce security breaches involving unauthorized access to our and or customer information  vi credit card fraud  and vii competition and general economic conditions specific to the internet  e commerce and the apparel industry 
our inability to effectively address these risks and any other risks that we face in connection with our internet operations could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
changes in the health care regulatory environment could cause us to incur additional expense and our failure to comply with related legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of were signed into law in the us this legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage for those already insured 
we do not expect any material short term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation  however  as additional requirements from the legislation continue to go into effect  the company expects to incur an increase in its expenses 
if this legislation and future changes in healthcare legislation significantly increase our expenses  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we face risks related to claims and legal proceedings  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
from time to time  we are subject to various claims and legal proceedings  including  without limitation  those arising or allegedly arising out of wage and hour claims  discrimination claims and other claims under labor laws and intellectual property claims 
for example  we are currently subject to the legal proceedings described under part i item legal proceedings 
the claims and legal proceedings to which we are or may become subject could involve large damages or settlements and significant defense costs 
we maintain insurance to cover a portion of the losses associated with settlements and adverse judgments  but those losses could exceed the scope of the coverage in effect  or coverage of particular claims or legal proceedings could be unavailable or denied 
as a result  certain claims and legal proceedings could arise for which we do not have insurance coverage or insurance provides only partial coverage and which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
risks related to our common stock the price of our class a common stock has fluctuated significantly during the past several years and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
our class a common stock  which is traded on the nasdaq global select market  has experienced and may continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
the market price of our class a common stock is likely to fluctuate  both because of actual and perceived changes in our operating results and prospects and because of general volatility in the stock market 
the market price of our class a common stock could continue to fluctuate widely in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  including comparable store sales  the addition or loss of suppliers  customers and other business relationships  changes in financial estimates of  and recommendations by  securities analysts  conditions or trends in the apparel and consumer products industries  additions or departures of key personnel  sales of our class a common stock  general market and economic conditions  and other events or factors  including the realization of any of the risks described in this risk factors section  many of which are beyond our control 
fluctuations in the price and trading volume of our class a common stock in response to factors such as those set forth above could be unrelated or disproportionate to our actual operating performance 
we have never paid dividends on our class a common stock and do not plan to do so in the future 
holders of shares of our class a common stock are entitled to receive any dividends that may be declared by our board of directors 
however  we have not paid any cash dividends on our class a common stock and we do not expect to for the foreseeable future 
also  our agreements with our senior lenders limit the payment of dividends to our stockholders 
our charter provisions and delaware law may have anti takeover effects 

table of contents our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to designate and issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that could differentially and adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our class a common stock  which could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
furthermore  certain provisions of delaware law applicable to our company could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving our company  including section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the possible issuance of preferred stock and the application of anti takeover provisions of delaware law could each have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company  including  without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest  making the acquisition of a substantial block of class a common stock more difficult and limiting the price that investors might in the future be willing to pay for shares of our class a common stock

the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties  and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the heading forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
executive overview we are a national specialty retailer operating stores selling fashionable and contemporary apparel and accessory items designed for female customers aged to years old 
we operate two nationwide  primarily mall based  chains of retail stores under the names wet seal and arden b 
at february   we had retail stores in states and puerto rico 
of the stores  there were wet seal stores and arden b stores 
we report our results of operations as two reportable segments representing our two retail divisions wet seal and arden b 
e commerce operations for wet seal and arden b are included in their respective operating segments 
although the two operating segments have many similarities in their products  production processes  distribution methods and regulatory environments  there are differences in most of these areas and distinct differences in their economic characteristics 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to the end of january 
the reporting periods include weeks of operations ended february  fiscal and weeks of operations ended january  fiscal and january  fiscal 
we consider the following to be key performance indicators in evaluating our performance comparable store sales for purposes of measuring comparable store sales  sales include merchandise sales as well as membership fee revenues recognized under our wet seal division s frequent buyer program during the applicable period 
stores are deemed comparable stores on the first day of the month following the one year anniversary of their opening or significant remodel relocation  which we define to be a square footage increase or decrease of at least 
stores that are remodeled or relocated with a resulting square footage change of less than are maintained in the comparable store base with no interruption 
however  stores that are closed for four or more days in a fiscal month  due to remodel  relocation or other reasons  are removed from the comparable store base for that fiscal month as well as for the comparable fiscal month in the following fiscal year 
comparable store sales results are important in achieving operating leverage on expenses such as store payroll  occupancy  depreciation and amortization  general and administrative expenses  and other costs that are at least partially fixed 
positive comparable store sales results generate greater operating leverage on expenses while negative comparable store sales results negatively affect operating leverage 
comparable store sales results also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash and working capital 
average transaction counts we consider the trend in the average number of sales transactions occurring in our stores to be a key performance metric 
to the extent we are able to increase transaction counts in our stores that more than offset the decrease  if any  in the average dollar sale per transaction  we will generate increases in our comparable store sales 
gross margins we analyze the components of gross margin  specifically cumulative mark on  markups  markdowns  shrink  buying costs  distribution costs and store occupancy costs 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups  a 
table of contents significant increase in our use of markdowns or in inventory shrink  or an inability to generate sufficient sales leverage on other components of cost of sales could have an adverse impact on our gross margin results and results of operations 
operating loss income we view operating loss income as a key indicator of our financial success 
the key drivers of operating loss income are comparable store sales  gross margins and the changes we experience in operating costs 
cash flow and liquidity working capital we evaluate cash flow from operations  liquidity and working capital to determine our short term operational financing needs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  some of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our audited consolidated financial statements 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
our accounting policies and estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
the policies and estimates discussed below involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies that are material to our audited consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we have certain accounting policies that require more significant management judgment and estimates than others 
these include our accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition  short term investments  merchandise inventories  long lived assets  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  insurance reserves and legal loss contingencies 
revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchases by customers at our retail store locations 
taxes collected from our customers are recorded on a net basis 
for e commerce sales  revenue is recognized at the estimated time goods are received by customers 
e commerce customers typically receive goods within four days of being shipped 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers for e commerce sales are included in net sales 
for fiscal   and  shipping and handling fee revenues were million  million and million  respectively  within net sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
we have recorded accruals to estimate sales returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
our sales return policy allows customers to return merchandise within days of original purchase 
wet seal retail store merchandise may be returned for store credit only and arden b retail store merchandise may be returned for cash refund or store credit within seven days of the original purchase date  and for store credit only thereafter 
for wet seal and arden b e commerce sales  merchandise may be returned within days for a full refund 
actual return rates have historically been within management s estimates and the accruals established 
as the accrual for merchandise returns is based on estimates  the actual returns could differ from the accrual  which could impact net sales 
the accrual for merchandise returns is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million at both february   and january  we recognize the sales from gift cards  gift certificates and store credits as they are redeemed for merchandise 
prior to redemption  we maintain an unearned revenue liability for gift cards  gift certificates and store credits until we are released from such liability 
our gift cards  gift certificates and store credits do not have expiration dates  however  over time  a percentage of gift cards  gift certificates and store credits are not redeemed or recovered breakage 
based upon historical redemption trend data  we determined that the likelihood of redemption of unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates and store credits two years after their issuance is remote and  accordingly  we adjust our unearned revenue liability quarterly to record breakage as additional sales for gift cards  gift certificates and store credits that remained unredeemed two years after their issuance 
our net sales for fiscal   and included benefits of million  million and million  respectively  to reduce our unearned revenue liability for estimated unredeemed amounts 
the unearned revenue for gift cards  gift certificates and store credits is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at february  and january   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from the assumptions underlying our breakage adjustments  or our future experience indicates the likelihood of redemption of gift cards  gift certificates and store credits becomes remote at a different point in time after issuance  we may recognize further 
table of contents significant adjustments to our accruals for such unearned revenue  which could have a significant effect on our net sales and results of operations 
we maintain a frequent buyer program  the fashion insider card  through our wet seal division 
under the program  customers receive a to discount on all purchases made during a month period and are provided off coupons that may be used on purchases during such period 
the annual membership fee of is nonrefundable 
discounts received by customers on purchases using the fashion insider program are recognized at the time of such purchases 
we recognize membership fee revenue under the fashion insider program on a straight line basis over the month membership period 
from time to time  we test alternative program structures  and promotions tied to the program  and may decide to further modify the program in ways that could affect customer usage patterns 
as a result of this program testing and potential further modifications  we believe it is appropriate to maintain straight line recognition of membership fee revenue 
we may  in the future  determine that recognition of membership fee revenue on a different basis is appropriate  which would affect net sales 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at february  and january   respectively 
we maintain a customer loyalty program through our arden b division 
under the program  customers accumulate points based on purchase activity 
once a loyalty program member achieves a certain point level  the member earns awards that may be redeemed for merchandise 
unredeemed awards and accumulated partial points are accrued as unearned revenue and awards redeemed by the member for merchandise are recorded as an increase to net sales 
we convert into fractional awards the points accumulated by customers who have not made purchases within the preceding months 
similar to all other awards currently being granted under the program  such fractional awards expire if unredeemed after days 
the unearned revenue for this program is recorded in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at february  and january   respectively 
if actual redemptions ultimately differ from accrued redemption levels  or if we further modify the terms of the program in a way that affects expected redemption value and levels  we could record adjustments to the unearned revenue accrual  which would affect net sales 
short term investments our short term investments consisted of interest bearing bonds of various us government agencies and certificates of deposit  have maturities that are less than one year and are carried at amortized cost plus accrued income due to our intent to hold to maturity 
short term investments on the consolidated balance sheets were million at february  merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which generally is the merchandise selling price 
cost is calculated using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is stated at its current retail selling value and then is converted to a cost basis by applying a cost to retail ratio based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and estimates  such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins 
markdowns are recorded when the sales value of the inventory has diminished 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
when a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise  the resulting gross margin reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
total markdowns  including permanent and promotional markdowns  on a cost basis in fiscal   and  were million  million  and million  respectively  and represented   and of net sales  respectively 
we accrued million and million for planned but unexecuted markdowns  including markdowns related to slow moving merchandise  as of february  and january   respectively 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may be required that could reduce our gross margin  operating income and the carrying value of inventories 
our success is largely dependent upon our ability to anticipate the changing fashion tastes of our customers and to respond to those changing tastes in a timely manner 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changing styles  trends or brand preferences of our customers  we may experience lower sales  excess inventories and more frequent and extensive markdowns  which would adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important that could result in the necessity to perform an impairment review include a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and a projection or forecast that indicates continuing losses or insufficient income associated with the realization of a long lived asset or asset group 
other factors include a significant change in the manner of the use of the asset or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
this evaluation is performed based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities compared with the carrying value of the related assets 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  measured by the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets  based on discounted estimated future cash flows using our weighted average cost of capital 
with regard to store assets  which are comprised of leasehold improvements  fixtures and computer hardware and software  we consider the assets at each individual store to represent an asset group 
in addition  we considered the relevant valuation techniques that could be applied without undue cost and effort and have determined that the discounted estimated future cash flow approach provides the most relevant and reliable means by which to determine fair value in this circumstance 
we conduct our quarterly impairment evaluation at the individual store level using the guidance under applicable accounting standards 
the quarterly analysis includes our estimates of future cash flows using only the cash inflows and outflows that are directly related to each store over the remaining lease term 
key assumptions made by us and included within our cash flow estimates are future sales and gross margin projections 
we determine the future sales and gross margin projections by considering each store recent and historical performance  our overall performance trends and projections and the potential impact of strategic initiatives on future performance 
our evaluation during fiscal   and included impairment testing of   and stores and resulted in   and stores being impaired  respectively  as their projected future cash flows were not sufficient to cover the net carrying value of their assets 
as such  we recorded the following non cash charges related to our retail stores within asset impairment in the consolidated statements of operations  to write down the carrying values of these stores long lived assets to their estimated fair values in thousands except for number of stores 
fiscal year ended february  january  january  in thousands  expect for number of stores aggregate carrying value of all long lived assets impaired less impairment charges aggregate fair value of all long lived assets impaired number of stores with asset impairment of the stores that were tested and not impaired during fiscal  as of february   twelve could be deemed to be at risk of future impairment 
when making this determination  we considered the potential impact that reasonably possible changes to sales and gross margin performance versus our current projections for these stores could have on their current estimated cash flows 
in addition to recent and historical performance  we consider the positive impact expected from our strategic initiatives when determining the key assumptions to use within the projected cash flows for each store during our quarterly analysis 
if we are not able to achieve our projected key financial metrics  and strategic initiatives being implemented do not result in significant improvements in our current financial performance trend  we may incur additional impairment charges in the future for those stores tested and not deemed to be impaired in our most recent quarterly analysis  as well as for additional stores not tested in our most recent quarterly analysis 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options granted to employees 
we use these values to recognize stock compensation expense for stock options 
the black scholes model is complex and requires 
table of contents significant exercise of judgment to estimate future common stock dividend yield  common stock expected volatility and the expected life of the stock options 
these assumptions significantly affect our stock option valuations  and future changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations of future stock option grants and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined stock option values were better represented by an alternative valuation method  such change could also significantly affect future stock compensation expense 
we also apply the black scholes and monte carlo simulation models to value performance shares granted to employees 
use of the black scholes model for this purpose requires the same exercise of judgment noted above 
the monte carlo simulation model is also complex and requires significant exercise of judgment to estimate expected returns on our common stock  expected common stock volatility and our maximum expected share value during applicable vesting periods 
we currently believe monte carlo simulation provides the most relevant value of performance share grants as the simulation allows for vesting throughout the vesting period and includes an assumption for equity returns over time  while the black scholes method does not 
as the monte carlo simulation provides a more precise estimate of fair value  we have used that approach to value our performance shares for accounting purposes 
the assumptions we use to value our performance shares significantly affect the resulting values used for accounting purposes 
accordingly  changes in these assumptions could significantly change valuations and  thus  affect future stock compensation expense 
in addition  if circumstances were to change such that we determined performance share values were better represented by the black scholes model or an alternative valuation method  and such changes resulted in a significant change in the value of performance shares  such changes could also significantly affect future stock compensation 
the following table summarizes stock based compensation recorded in the consolidated statements of operations fiscal year ended february  january  january  in thousands cost of sales selling  general  and administrative expenses stock based compensation accounting for income taxes our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid and tax benefits to be realized 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states federal jurisdiction as well as various state jurisdictions within the united states 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense and net operating loss nols  pursuant to applicable accounting standards 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized using all available positive and negative evidence  including our year cumulative operating results  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the business 
these estimates are based on our best judgment at the time made based on current and projected circumstances and conditions 
in accordance with the applicable accounting standards  we maintain a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset when it is deemed it to be more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as a result of our evaluation of all evidence as of february   we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would not realize our net deferred tax assets and we recorded a million increase to provision for income taxes in order to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as a result  we have discontinued recognizing income tax benefits related to our nols until it is determined that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits from our deferred tax assets 
for further information  see note income taxes  to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
in addition  we evaluate our charitable contributions carryforward for likelihood of realizability prior to expiration and provide a valuation allowance against any amounts that are deemed more likely than not to be unrealizable 

table of contents during the third quarter of fiscal  we implemented a change in tax method  upon filing our federal income tax return  which resulted in the reduction of deferred tax assets related to our charitable contribution carry forwards of million 
this decrease was recorded as a deferred income tax charge and increased our effective income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal was approximately negative due to the recording of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we also incurred cash payable for income taxes for the fiscal year of approximately of pre tax loss  representing certain state income taxes 
section of the internal revenue code section contains provisions that may limit the availability of federal nols to be used to offset taxable income in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interests of our common stock 
under section  an ownership change that triggers potential limitations on nols occurs when there has been a greater than change in ownership interest by shareholders owning or more of a company over a period of three years or less 
based on our analysis  we had ownership changes in april and december  which resulted in section limitations applying to federal nols generated prior to those dates  which were approximately million 
despite these ownership changes  we may utilize all of our million of nols as of february   to offset future taxable income 
we may experience additional ownership changes in the future  which could further limit the amount of federal nols annually available 
as of february   there have been no ownership changes since in addition  we may determine that varying state laws with respect to nol utilization may result in lower limits  or an inability to utilize nols in some states altogether  which could result in us incurring additional state income taxes 
during fiscal  the state of california passed legislation that suspended our ability to utilize nols to offset taxable income in fiscal and in late  the state of california extended such legislation that further suspended use of nols to fiscal and as a result  we incurred additional cash state income taxes in california 
the company may also generate income in future periods on a federal alternative minimum tax basis  which would result in alternative minimum taxes payable on a portion of such income 
the calculation of our tax assets involves assessing uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations 
at february   we had no significant unrecognized tax benefits or expenses that  if recognized  would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods 
we are currently unaware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments  accruals or material deviations from our recognized tax positions 
however  if we later identify other income tax issues that result in significant additional payments or necessary accruals  this could have a material adverse effect on our reported results 
insurance reserves we are partially self insured for our workers compensation and employee group health plans 
under the workers compensation insurance program  we are liable for a deductible of million for each individual claim and an aggregate annual liability of million 
under our employee group health plan  we are liable for a deductible of million for each claim and an aggregate monthly liability of million 
the monthly aggregate liability is subject to adjustment based on the number of participants in the plan each month 
for both of these insurance plans  we record a liability for the costs associated with reported claims and a projected estimate for unreported claims considering historical experience and industry standards 
we will continue to adjust the estimates as actual experience dictates 
a significant change in the number or dollar amount of claims could cause us to revise our estimate of potential losses and affect our reported results 
included in accrued liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets as of february  and january   are million and million  respectively  for reported claims and estimated unreported claims under our self insured workers compensation and employee group health plans 
legal loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various legal losses 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
as of february   we have accrued million for loss contingencies in connection with the litigation matters discussed in note commitments and contingencies 
we are vigorously defending the pending matters and will continue to evaluate our potential exposure and estimated costs as these matters progress 
future developments may require us to increase the amount of this accrual  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents current trends and outlook the retail environment in the us showed improvement in fiscal  but only modest growth in the retail industry is expected for fiscal due to continued uncertainty regarding the global economy and the slow recovery in the us housing market and unemployment rates  as well as recent increases to payroll taxes and fuel costs pressuring disposable income 
in addition  us gross domestic product growth remains slow  further contributing to a volatile  and generally weak  retail environment 
in fiscal  we ran aggressive promotions and incurred high levels of clearance markdowns at both wet seal and arden b to address product that was performing below expectations 
this accelerated beginning in the fiscal third quarter  in an effort to clear merchandise from a previous strategy in effect from mid through the first half of fiscal at our wet seal division  through which we sought to provide elevated product and a narrower merchandise assortment to an older customer than who we had previously targeted 
in the fiscal third quarter  we began to re merchandise our wet seal stores with product intended to appeal to a wider demographic and with a broader merchandise assortment  similar to our strategy prior to mid during re merchandising and liquidation of the underperforming inventory  we experienced significant declines in our merchandise margin and comparable store sales 
in addition  as a result of external macro economic factors  such as rising fuel prices and increased payroll taxes on our customer  we expect an aggressive competitive environment in fiscal that will continue to require promotional activities that could prove challenging to margin improvement if not properly planned and managed 
our performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending 
consumer purchases of discretionary items  including our merchandise  generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty 
disposable income has decreased due to increases payroll taxes and increasing fuel costs  noted above  that may adversely impact the demand for our merchandise 
in addition  continued difficult economic conditions may impact many facets of our operations  including  among other things  the ability of one or more of our vendors to deliver their merchandise in a timely manner or otherwise meet their obligations to us 
although we believe we are sufficiently prepared and financially strong enough to endure the potential impact of current pressures on disposable income  and the current weak economic conditions in the us and world economic markets  if such conditions continue  or if they deteriorate further  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be further materially adversely affected 
our comparable store sales decreased during fiscal  driven by a comparable store sales decrease in our wet seal division and a comparable store sales decrease in our arden b division 
the wet seal division comparable store sales decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in transaction volume and average dollar sales per transaction  which was driven by a decrease in average unit selling price  partially offset by an increase in units purchased per customer 
at wet seal  our underperformance reflected the failure of our mid through mid strategy to offer more elevated product for an older target customer 
upon changing our strategy back to our traditional fast fashion model focused on a range of customers from young teens to early twenties  aggressive promotions were required to re merchandise the store  further leading to poor performance in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the arden b division comparable store sales decrease was primarily driven by a decline in transaction volume and a decrease in average dollar sales per transaction  which was driven by a decrease in average unit selling price  partially offset by an increase in units purchased per customer 
at arden b  our performance reflects product content that was not well received by our customer 
our combined e commerce sales remained consistent at million during fiscal  as compared to fiscal store openings and closures during fiscal  we opened and closed wet seal stores and closed arden b stores 
we believe future closures for at least the next months will primarily result from lease expirations where we decide not to extend  or are unable to extend  a store lease 
we currently plan to open new wet seal stores primarily to replace the approximately to stores that will be closing upon lease expiration in fiscal  with openings primarily in outlet centers  in which we have experienced relatively strong sales productivity and profitability 
we currently plan to close approximately arden b stores in fiscal upon lease expiration  as we focus efforts on improving merchandising and marketing strategies in that business

wet seal generated an operating loss of of net sales during fiscal versus operating income of of net sales during fiscal the decrease was primarily due to our unsuccessful strategy change in effect from mid through the first half of fiscal in our wet seal division through which we sought to provide elevated product and a narrower merchandise assortment to an older customer than who we had previously targeted 
in an effort to clear merchandise from this previous strategy  we ran aggressive promotions and took high levels of clearance markdowns  resulting in significant declines in our merchandise margin and comparable store sales

senior revolving credit facility on february   we renewed  via amendment and restatement  our million senior revolving credit facility with our existing lender the facility  which can be increased up to million in the absence of any default and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent specified in the facility 
the facility expires in february under the facility  we are subject to borrowing base limitations on the amount that can be borrowed and certain customary covenants  including  under certain circumstances  covenants limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments and acquisitions  grant liens  pay dividends  repurchase our common stock  close stores and dispose of assets  without the lender s consent

we anticipate receiving approximately million in tenant improvement allowances from landlords  resulting in net capital expenditures of between million and million 
other factors affecting liquidity and capital resources seasonality and inflation our business is seasonal in nature  with the christmas season  beginning the week of thanksgiving and ending the first saturday after christmas  and the back to school season  beginning the last week of july and ending during september  historically accounting for a large percentage of our sales volume 
for the past three fiscal years  the christmas and back to school seasons together accounted for an average of slightly less than of our annual net sales 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
however  we began to experience cost pressures in the fourth quarter of fiscal and saw further cost increases through fiscal and most of fiscal  as a result of rising commodity prices  primarily for cotton  increased labor costs  due to labor shortages in china  from which a majority of our merchandise is sourced  and increasing fuel costs 
although cotton prices have stabilized  the other sourcing cost pressures are expected to continue into fiscal the rising value of the currency in china relative to the us dollar may also have an impact on future product costs 
in response to the costs increases  we leverage our large vendor base to lower costs  are identifying new vendors and are assessing ongoing promotional strategies in efforts to maintain or improve upon historical merchandise margin levels 
we cannot be certain that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
consumer spending the financial performance of our business is susceptible to declines in discretionary consumer spending  availability of consumer credit and low consumer confidence in the united states 
increasing fuel prices  commodity costs and payroll and other taxes may also cause a shift in consumer demand away from the retail clothing products that we offer 
there are no guarantees that government or other initiatives will limit the duration or severity of the current economic challenges or stabilize factors that affect our sales and profitability 
continuing adverse economic trends could affect us more significantly than companies in other industries 
commitments and contingencies our principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments at february   are summarized in the following charts 
we have no other off balance sheet commitments 
contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years over years lease commitments operating leases fixed common area maintenance supplemental employee retirement plan merchandise on order with suppliers total lease commitments include operating leases for our retail stores  principal executive offices  warehouse facilities  vehicles  computers and office equipment under operating lease agreements expiring at various times through certain leases for our retail stores include fixed common area maintenance obligations 

table of contents we have a defined benefit supplemental employee retirement plan the serp for one former director 
the serp provides for retirement benefits through life insurance 
we funded a portion of the serp obligation in prior years through contributions to a trust arrangement known as a rabbi trust 
we place merchandise orders approximately to days in advance for domestic merchandise and to days in advance for imported merchandise 
we do not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any single supplier 
we have markdown risk to the extent we do not ultimately achieve adequate sell through on such merchandise 
our other commercial commitments consist of letters of credit primarily for the procurement of domestic and imported merchandise and to secure obligations to certain insurance providers  and are secured through our facility

recently adopted and not yet adopted accounting pronouncements the information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk to the extent that we borrow under the facility  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
at february   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility 
at february   the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the facility was 
based upon a sensitivity analysis as of february   if we had average outstanding borrowings of million during fiscal  a basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a potential increase in interest expense of approximately  for fiscal as of february   we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we contract for and settle all purchases in us dollars 
we only purchase a modest amount of goods directly from international vendors 
thus  we consider the effect of currency rate changes to be indirect and we believe the effect of a major shift in currency exchange rates on short term results would be minimal  as a hypothetical change in the foreign exchange rate of the chinese currency against the us dollar as of february  would not materially affect our results of operations or cash flows 
over a longer period  the cumulative year to year impact of such changes  especially the exchange rate of the chinese currency against the us dollar  could be significant  albeit indirectly  through increased charges in us dollars from our vendors that source their products internationally
