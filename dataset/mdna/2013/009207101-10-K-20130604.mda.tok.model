item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company operates in three business segments 
the overnight air cargo segment  comprised of its mountain air cargo  inc mac and csa air  inc csa subsidiaries  operates in the air express delivery services industry 
the ground equipment sales segment  comprised of its global ground support  llc ggs subsidiary  manufactures and provides mobile deicers and other specialized equipment products to passenger and cargo airlines  airports  the u 
s 
military and industrial customers 
the ground support services segment  comprised of its global aviation services  llc gas subsidiary  provides ground support equipment maintenance and facilities maintenance services to domestic airlines and aviation service providers 
each business segment has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on operating income 
following is a table detailing revenues by segment and by major customer category dollars in thousands year ended march  overnight air cargo segment fedex ground equipment sales segment military commercial domestic commercial international ground support services segment mac and csa are short haul express airfreight carriers and provide overnight air cargo services to one primary customer  fedex corporation fedex 
mac also on occasion provides maintenance services to other airline customers and the u 
s 
military  though no such services were provided in fiscal or fiscal under the terms of dry lease service agreements  which currently cover all of the revenue aircraft  the company receives a monthly administrative fee based on the number of aircraft operated and passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the amount of the administrative fee is reduced for aircraft considered to be soft parked  and at march   eight of the revenue aircraft were considered to be soft parked 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue  at cost 
pursuant to such agreements  fedex determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by mac and csa  with all other operational decisions made by the company 
these agreements are renewable on two to five year terms and may be terminated by fedex at any time upon days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with fedex are standard within the airfreight contract delivery service industry 
fedex has been a customer of the company since during the quarter ended march   fedex transferred an atr aircraft from mac s fleet to a feeder operator in canada to meet scheduling needs 
the administrative revenue related to atr aircraft is significantly greater than the administrative revenue related to the operation of a cessna caravan 
mac and csa combined revenues increased by  in fiscal see the following comparison of fiscal year to for details of the increase 
ggs manufactures and supports aircraft deicers and other specialized equipment on a worldwide basis 
ggs manufactures five basic models of mobile deicing equipment with capacities ranging from to  gallons 
ggs also offers fixed pedestal mounted deicers 
each model can be customized as requested by the customer  including single operator configuration  fire suppressant equipment  open basket or enclosed cab design  a patented forced air deicing nozzle and on board glycol blending system to substantially reduce glycol usage  color and style of the exterior finish 
ggs also manufactures five models of scissor lift equipment  for catering  cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft  and has developed a line of decontamination equipment  flight line tow tractors  glycol recovery vehicles and other special purpose mobile equipment 
ggs competes primarily on the basis of the quality  performance and reliability of its products  prompt delivery  customer service and price 
in june  ggs was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the usaf 
ggs was awarded two three year extensions of that contract through june on july   the company announced that ggs had been awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the usaf 
the contract award was for one year with four additional one year extension options that may be exercised by the usaf 
in june  the third option period under the contract was exercised  extending the contract to july in september  ggs was awarded a contract to supply flight line tow tractors to the usaf 
the contract award was for one year commencing september  with four additional one year extension options that may be exercised by the usaf 
in august  the second option period under the contract was exercised  extending the contract to september because these contracts with the usaf do not obligate the usaf to purchase a set or minimum number of units  the value of these contracts  as well as the number of units to be delivered  depends upon the usaf s requirements and available funding 
ggs revenues increased by  in fiscal see the following comparison of fiscal year to for details of the increase 
gas was formed in september to operate the aircraft ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services business of the company 
gas is providing aircraft ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services to a wide variety of customers at locations throughout the country 
gas revenues increased by  in fiscal see the following comparison of fiscal year to for details of the increase 
fiscal summary revenues for our overnight air cargo segment totaled  for the year ended march   representing a  increase over the prior year 
the segment saw its operating income decrease by  or in fiscal the increase in revenues is principally due to an increase in maintenance operating costs passed through to our air cargo customer at cost 
the decrease in operating income is attributed to increased management labor costs and administrative costs in both its flight and maintenance departments in fiscal  as the segment added key personnel in both the flight and management departments during the fiscal year 
revenues for ggs totaled  for the year ended march   an increase of  over the prior year  while operating income increased by  from an operating loss of  in the prior year 
the increase in ggs revenues is primarily due to million of sales of flight line tow tractors under the contract with the usaf 
the increase in operating income is the result of the increase in sales as well as a slight increase in ggs s gross margin percentage 
gross margin continues to be negatively impacted by a highly competitive environment  including domestic  international and military contracts 
in addition  margins on the flight line tow tractors are very slim 
in spite of those factors  the segment s gross margin increased by one half percent in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year as the segment has focused on improving production efficiency 
during the year ended march   revenues from our gas subsidiary totaled  representing a  increase from the prior year 
the segment also saw its operating income increase by  or in fiscal these increases are the result of the addition of new customers and locations as this segment continues to build its revenue base 
fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue resulted from increases in all three operating segments 
revenues in the overnight air cargo segment increased  to  principally due to increases in maintenance operating costs passed through to our air cargo customer at cost 
revenues in the ground equipment sales segment increased by  to  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the sale of million of flight line tow tractors to the usaf in fiscal compared to  in fiscal revenues in the ground support services segment increased by  to  resulting from an increase in new customers as well as an increase in work and locations for existing customers 
operating expenses on a consolidated basis increased  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was due to a number of factors 
operating expenses in the overnight air cargo segment were up  generally correlating to the increase in revenues within that segment 
ground equipment sales operating costs increased   again fairly closely correlating to the increase in revenues within that segment 
ground equipment sales gross margin continues to be negatively impacted by a highly competitive environment  including domestic  international and military contracts 
in addition  the segment s gross margin has been negatively impacted by low margins on the million of sales of flight line tow tractors in the current year 
in spite of these pressures  the segment was able to gain production efficiencies resulting in a one half percent increase in gross margin compared to the prior year 
operating expenses in the ground support services segment increased by  relating to the increased revenues produced in fiscal the ground services segment saw a reduction in its operating margins as it incurred significant costs in starting up and running new large stations in general and administrative expense increased  to  in fiscal the company incurred increased general and administration costs in the ground support services segment of  relating to staffing costs  rents and other operating costs  and supply costs associated with new stations and increased business in fiscal in addition  the company experienced a  increase in professional fees in related to the various shareholder matters and a  increase in profit sharing expense related to the increased profit generated by the company in fiscal operating income for the year ended march  was  a  increase from fiscal the increase was principally the result of the substantial increases in revenues at the ground equipment sales and ground support services segments as discussed above 
non operating income  net for the year ended march  was  a  decrease from fiscal non operating income is interest income net of interest expense  and decreased as a result of decreased rates of return in fiscal income tax expense of  in fiscal represented an effective tax rate of  compared to income tax expense of  in fiscal which represented an effective tax rate of

of this amount  million was invested in liquid money market accounts 
all invested amounts are fully insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  with the exception of approximately  held in money market accounts and  invested in uninsured demand debt obligations of duke energy corporation 
as of march   the company s working capital amounted to  an increase of  compared to march  the company has a  secured long term revolving credit line with an expiration date of august  the revolving credit line contains customary events of default  a subjective acceleration clause and a fixed charge coverage requirement  with which the company was in compliance at march  the company had no outstanding obligations under its line of credit at march  and see note in the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  for further discussion 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its line of credit  however  the line of credit had no outstanding balance at march  and  and the company had no borrowings on the line of credit during the year ended march  following is a table of changes in cash flow for the respective years ended march  and year ended march  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities was  more for fiscal compared to fiscal the major contributor to this cash flow increase was a substantial decrease in inventories in fiscal  primarily as a result of inventory reduction initiatives implemented at ggs during fiscal  compared to a substantial increase in fiscal this increase was partially offset by a cash flow decrease caused by a substantial increase in accounts receivable in fiscal  primarily the result of high ggs sales and deliveries in march  compared to a substantial decrease in fiscal cash used in investing activities was  less in fiscal  capital expenditures decreased by  in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the company expended approximately  in overhaul costs for its corporate aircraft in fiscal and also expended  for vehicles and tooling for new gas stations in fiscal cash used in financing activities was  more in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal there are currently no commitments for significant capital expenditures 
the company s board of directors  on august   adopted the policy to pay an annual cash dividend in the first quarter of each fiscal year  in an amount to be determined by the board 
on may  the company declared a 
per share cash dividend  to be paid on june  to shareholders of record june  off balance sheet arrangements the company defines an off balance sheet arrangement as any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company is not currently engaged in the use of any of these arrangements 
impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its manufacturing operations  because increased costs to date have been passed on to its customers 
under the terms of its overnight air cargo business contracts the major cost components of its operations  consisting principally of fuel  crew and other direct operating costs  and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed by its customer 
significant increases in inflation rates could  however  have a material impact on future revenue and operating income 
seasonality ggs s business has historically been seasonal 
the company has continued its efforts to reduce ggs s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by increasing military and international sales and broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings throughout the year 
in june  ggs was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force  and subsequently was awarded two three year extensions on the contract  which expired in june in july  ggs was awarded a new one year contract with the united states air force with four additional one year extension options 
although sales remain somewhat seasonal  particularly with regard to commercial deicers which typically are delivered prior to the winter season  this diversification has lessened the seasonal impacts in the past when sales under the contract with the united states air force were a significant component of the company revenues 
if sales to the united states air force cease to be a significant component of ggs s sales  seasonal patterns of revenues and earnings attributable to its commercial deicer business may resume  with revenues and operating income for the segment being lower in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the overnight air cargo and ground support services segments are not susceptible to seasonal trends 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions 
the company s estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from estimates 
the company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established based on management s estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined using information such as customer credit history  industry information  credit reports  customer financial condition and the collectability of outstanding accounts receivables 
the estimates can be affected by changes in the financial strength of the aviation industry  customer credit issues or general economic conditions 
inventories 
the company s parts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories are based on assessment of the marketability of slow moving and obsolete inventories 
historical parts usage  current period sales  estimated future demand and anticipated transactions between willing buyers and sellers provide the basis for estimates 
estimates are subject to volatility and can be affected by reduced equipment utilization  existing supplies of used inventory available for sale  the retirement of aircraft or ground equipment and changes in the financial strength of the aviation industry 
warranty reserves 
the company warranties its ground equipment products for up to a three year period from date of sale 
product warranty reserves are recorded at time of sale based on the historical average warranty cost and are adjusted as actual warranty cost becomes known 
income taxes 
income taxes have been provided using the liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the net affects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 
revenue recognition 
cargo revenue is recognized upon completion of contract terms 
maintenance and ground support services revenue is recognized when the service has been performed 
revenue from product sales is recognized when contract terms are completed and ownership has passed to the customer
