item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global provider of open source software solutions  using a community powered approach to develop and offer reliable and high performing operating system  middleware  virtualization  storage and cloud technologies 
open source software is an alternative to proprietary software and represents a different model for the development and licensing of commercial software code than that typically used for proprietary software 
because open source software code is often freely shared  there are customarily no licensing fees for the use of open source software 
therefore  we do not recognize revenue from the licensing of the code itself 
we provide value to our customers through the development  aggregation  integration  testing  certification  delivery  maintenance  enhancement and support of our red hat enterprise technologies  and by providing a level of performance  reliability  scalability  flexibility  stability and security for the enterprise technologies we package and distribute 
moreover  because communities of developers not employed by us assist with the creation of our open source offerings  opportunities for further innovation of our offerings are supplemented by these communities 
we primarily offer our enterprise technologies in the form of annual or multi year subscriptions  and we recognize revenue over the period of the subscription agreements with our customers 
we market our offerings primarily to enterprise customers 
we have focused on introducing and gaining acceptance for red hat enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture 
our operating system  red hat enterprise linux  has gained widespread isv and ihv support 
we have continued to build our open source architecture by expanding our enterprise operating system and middleware offerings and introducing virtualization  storage  cloud and other offerings 
we derive our revenue and generate cash from customers primarily from two sources i subscription revenue and ii training and services revenue 
these arrangements typically involve subscriptions to red hat enterprise technologies 
our revenue is affected by  among other factors  corporate  government and consumer spending levels 
in evaluating the performance of our business  we consider a number of factors  including total revenue  deferred revenue  operating income  operating margin and cash flows from operations 
the arrangements with our customers that produce this revenue and cash are explained in further detail in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
in our fiscal year ended february   we focused and expect in our fiscal year ending february  to continue to focus on  among other things  generating i widespread adoption of red hat enterprise technologies by enterprise customers globally  ii increased revenue from our existing user base by renewing existing subscriptions  converting users of free versions of our enterprise technologies to paying subscribers  providing additional value to our customers and growing the number of open source enterprise technologies we offer  iii increased revenue by providing additional consulting and other targeted services and iv increased revenue from strategic acquisitions and channel partner relationships  including distributors  oems  ihvs  isvs  cloud computing providers  vars and system integrators  and from our own international expansion  among other means 
revenue for the year ended february   total revenue increased  or million  to billion from billion for the year ended february  subscription revenue increased or 
table of contents million  driven primarily by additional subscriptions related to our principal red hat enterprise linux technologies  which continue to gain broader market acceptance in mission critical areas of computing  and our expansion of sales channels and our geographic footprint 
the increase is  in part  a result of the continued migration of enterprises in industries such as financial services  government  technology and telecommunications to our open source solutions from proprietary technologies 
training and services revenue increased or million for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  the increase is driven primarily by customer interest in new products and technologies 
we believe our success is influenced by the extent to which we can expand the breadth and depth of our technology and service offerings  our ability to enhance the value of subscriptions for red hat enterprise technologies through frequent and continuing innovations to these technologies while maintaining stable platforms over multi year periods  our ability to generate increasing revenue from channel partner and other strategic relationships  including distributors  oems  ihvs  isvs  cloud computing providers  vars and system integrators  the acceptance and widespread deployment of open source technologies by enterprises and similar institutions  such as government agencies  our ability to generate new and recurring subscription revenue for red hat enterprise technologies  and our ability to provide customers with consulting and training services that generate additional revenue 
deferred revenue  billings proxy and backlog deferred revenue our deferred revenue  current and long term  balance at february  was billion 
because of our subscription model and revenue recognition policies  deferred revenue improves predictability of future revenue 
for example  current deferred revenue provides a baseline for revenue to be recognized over the next twelve months 
similarly  long term deferred revenue provides a baseline for revenue to be recognized beyond twelve months 
total deferred revenue at february  increased million or as compared to the balance at february  of million 
the change in deferred revenue reported on our consolidated balance sheets of million differs from the million change in deferred revenue we reported on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended february  due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate deferred revenue balances from our foreign subsidiaries functional currency into us dollars 
billings proxy we approximate our annual billings by aggregating revenue recognized on our consolidated statements of operations with the change in total deferred revenue reported on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we use the change in deferred revenue as reported on our consolidated statements of cash flows because the amount has been adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates used to translate deferred revenue balances from our foreign subsidiaries functional currencies into us dollars 
our billings proxy increased by or million to billion for the year ended february  from billion for the year ended february  backlog our backlog as of february  totaled approximately billion and includes amounts billed to customers and recognized as current and long term deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet of 
table of contents million and million  respectively  plus the value of non cancellable subscription and services agreements to be billed in the future and not reflected in our financial results off balance sheet backlog which was in excess of million 
our off balance sheet backlog as of february  was in excess of million 
the resulting increase in off balance sheet backlog of or million for the year ended february  demonstrates increased customer commitment to our technologies 
we report our off balance sheet backlog as a conservative approximation  often describing the amount as in excess of  primarily because the value of underlying contracts is derived from data not yet subjected to the complete application of our revenue recognition policies 
we endeavor to derive the value of our off balance sheet backlog in a consistent manner year over year and therefore believe amounts are comparable 
subscription revenue our enterprise technologies are sold under subscription agreements 
these agreements typically have a one or three year subscription period 
a subscription generally entitles a customer to  among other things  a specified level of support  as well as new versions of the software  security updates  fixes  functionality enhancements and upgrades to the technology  if and when available  and compatibility with an ecosystem of certified hardware and software applications 
our customers have the ability to purchase higher levels of subscriptions that increase the level of support the customer is entitled to receive 
subscription revenue increased sequentially for each quarter of fiscal  and and is being driven primarily by the increased market acceptance and use of open source software by enterprises and our expansion of sales channels and geographic footprint during these periods 
revenue by geography in the year ended february   approximately million or of our revenue was generated outside the united states compared to approximately million or for the year ended february  our international operations are expected to continue to grow as our international sales force and channels become more mature and as we enter new locations or expand our presence in existing locations 
as of february   we had offices in more than locations throughout the world 
we operate our business in three geographic regions the americas us  latin america and canada  emea europe  middle east and africa  and asia pacific principally japan  singapore  india  australia  south korea and china 
revenue generated by the americas  emea and asia pacific for the three years ended february  was as follows in thousands americas emea asia pacific total year ended february  year ended february  year ended february  year over year revenue growth rates for our three geographical regions were as follows for the three years ended february  americas emea asia pacific total year ended february  year ended february  year ended february  excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  revenue from the americas  emea and asia pacific grew approximately  and  respectively  for the year ended february  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  total revenue grew for the year ended february  
table of contents as we expand further within each region  we anticipate revenue growth rates to become more similar among our geographic regions due to the similarity of products and services offered and the similarity in customer types or classes 
gross profit margin gross profit margin increased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  as a result of both a product mix shift to subscriptions and a slight increase in profit margins related to training and services 
gross profit margin on training and services revenue increased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february   primarily as a result of higher utilization rates for our consulting personnel and the implementation of a contractual arrangement with a global training partner that provides certain training services on our behalf and bears a portion of the fixed cost of providing such services  which makes our training expenses vary with demand 
gross profit margin by geography gross profit margins generated by our geographic segments for the three years ended february  were as follows americas emea asia pacific total year ended february  year ended february  year ended february  regional year over year variations in gross profit margins are primarily due to slight product mix shifts between subscriptions and services 
as we continue to expand our sales and support services within our geographic segments  we expect gross profit margins to further converge over the long run due to the similarity of products and services offered  similarity in production and distribution methods and the similarity in customer types or classes 
income from operations operating income was and of total revenue for the year ended february  and february   respectively 
the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenue is a result of the increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue 
operating expenses as a percent of revenue increased to for the year ended february  from for the year ended february  resulting primarily from investments made in our sales and marketing and research and development functions 
income from operations by geography operating income as a percentage of revenue generated by our geographic segments for the three years ended february  was as follows americas emea asia pacific total year ended february  year ended february  year ended february  total operating income as a percentage of revenue includes corporate non allocated share based compensation expense for the years ended february   february  and february  of million  million and million  respectively 
for additional information  see note segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents operating margin for all of our geographic operating segments decreased for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  primarily as a result of the increase in operating expenses associated with increased investments in our sales and marketing and research and development functions 
cash  cash equivalents  investments in debt and equity securities and cash flow from operations cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term available for sale investments in securities balances at february  totaled billion 
cash generated from operating activities for the year ended february  totaled million  which represents an increase of in operating cash flow as compared to the year ended february  this increase is due to an increase in subscription and services revenues  billings and collections during the same period 
our significant cash and investment balances give us a measure of flexibility to take advantage of opportunities such as acquisitions  increasing investment in international areas and repurchasing our common stock 
foreign currency exchange rates impact on results of operations approximately of our revenue for the year ended february  was produced by sales outside the united states 
we are exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component in determining net income 
the statements of operations of our non us operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenue and operating expenses from operations for our non us operations 
similarly  our revenue and operating expenses will decrease for our non us operations if the non us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from our prior fiscal year ended february   our revenue and operating expenses from non us operations for the year ended february  would have been higher than we reported february  by approximately million and million  respectively  which would have resulted in income from operations being higher by million 
business combinations on december   we completed the acquisition of manageiq  inc manageiq for approximately million in cash 
manageiq is a provider of enterprise cloud management and automation solutions that enable organizations to deploy  manage and optimize private clouds  public clouds and virtualized infrastructures 
as a result of the acquisition of manageiq  operating expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended february  during the year ended february   we acquired two businesses operating in the middleware space 
these acquisitions include technologies that are complementary to our jboss middleware technology 
one acquisition  which included certain assets and related operations acquired from polymita technologies sl polymita  closed on august  the second acquisition closed on september  and included certain assets and related operations acquired from fusesource  a division of progress software corporation fusesource 
transaction fees related to these two acquisitions totaled approximately million for the year ended february  and are included in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended february  as a result of these two acquisitions  operating expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended february  on october   we acquired gluster  inc gluster 
gluster develops  distributes and provides support for open source  scale out storage software 
the acquisition expands our enterprise software offerings to 
table of contents include management of unstructured data 
total consideration transferred as part of the acquisition was million and includes cash consideration of million and equity consideration related to assumed  nonvested employee share based awards of million 
the total fair value  as of october   of all assumed nonvested awards was million  of which million has been attributed to pre acquisition employee services and accordingly has been recognized as consideration transferred 
the remaining million of fair value will be recognized as compensation expense over the remaining vesting period 
for further discussion related to our acquisitions  see note business combinations to our consolidated financial statements 
facility exit costs in december  we entered into an agreement to sublease a building in downtown raleigh  north carolina in which our headquarters are currently located 
in connection with the transition to our new headquarters  we have endeavored to assign  sublease or otherwise dispose of our existing leases related to the two facilities that previously constituted our headquarters in raleigh  north carolina 
in may  we entered into a sublease agreement with an unrelated third party to lease one of the two facilities that previously constituted our headquarters 
as a result  we have recognized a loss of million for the year ended february  which represents the excess of our remaining obligation on the space over the agreed sublease income 
we will continue to market the remaining facility for sublease 
however  to the extent we are unable to sublease or otherwise dispose of such space and recover the full amount of our remaining obligation  we will be required to recognize a loss at the date we cease using this facility  currently estimated to be may at that time  our loss  net of deferred rent credits  with respect to the remaining facility is expected to be approximately million 
amortization of related leasehold improvements has been accelerated to coincide with our exit from the two facilities 
this change in estimated useful life resulted in incremental amortization expense of million for the year ended february   and is included in general and administration expense on our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements and describe our methods for applying us gaap in areas such as revenue recognition  deferred selling costs  fair value measurements  and foreign currency translation among other areas deemed significant 
in applying certain significant accounting policies  we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 
we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates  which we discuss further below 
critical accounting estimates are applied in the following areas revenue recognition  goodwill and other long lived assets  share based compensation  income taxes  and loss contingencies 
revenue recognition application of accounting principles related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires judgment 
for example  in transactions that include multiple elements  we must exercise judgment in determining whether adequate vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element 
changes to the elements in a transaction  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  and changes in the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
in addition  complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element transaction should be treated as separate units of accounting 
goodwill and other long lived assets we make judgments about the recoverability of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets  including capitalized software purchased or developed for internal use 
the assumptions and estimates used to determine recoverability of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by various factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal  multi year forecasts for our subscription and services offerings which often include emerging technologies 
changes in any of these various factors could materially impact our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
share based compensation we are required to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest and the amount of tax benefits we expect will ultimately be realized  among other things 

table of contents share based awards expected to vest we currently apply an estimated annual forfeiture rate of to the service based share awards we grant to our employees 
our estimated forfeiture rate is based on recent historical experience as well as qualitative considerations about management s expectations for attrition rates over the vesting periods 
actual attrition rates could vary significantly from our expectations resulting in material quarterly adjustments to our financial results 
during the year ended february  we granted service based share awards with a total fair value of million to which we applied an estimated annual forfeiture rate of 
with respect to performance based awards that we grant to certain executive officers and senior management  we estimate the number of shares expected to vest based primarily on our most current reported financial results relative to a defined peer group s most recent reported financial results 
because past or current financial trends may not be predictive of future financial performance  our estimate of the number of shares expected to vest may differ materially from the number of shares that actually vest 
the number of potential performance based shares available to vest as of february  totaled million  of which approximately million shares are expected to vest 
if all of the potential performance based shares were to vest  we would be required to recognize additional expense of approximately million 
see note share based awards to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion related to awards outstanding and expected to vest 
income tax benefits related to share based awards we recognize share based compensation expense based on an award s grant date fair value over the requisite service period 
because we do not know the actual amount of tax benefits an award will generate until such award is exercised or vested  we assume that the amount ultimately recognized for tax purposes will be the same amount we recognized in our operating results  that is for book purposes 
consequently  our deferred tax asset related to shared based compensation expense which totaled million as of february  is based on each qualifying award s grant date fair value rather than the award s to be determined exercise date intrinsic value or vesting date fair value 
historically  the difference between the grant date fair value and the exercise date intrinsic value has been significant 
as a result of such differences  for the years ended february   february  and february   we realized excess tax benefits related to share based awards totaling million  million and million  respectively 
if the share price for our common stock were to depreciate for a sustained period of time we could be required to recognize a tax benefit shortfall 
such shortfalls could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and to the extent such shortfalls accumulate in excess of approximately million our apic credit pool could materially  adversely impact our results of operations 
for further discussion  see note summary of significant accounting policies  note income taxes and note share based awards to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes as described in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements  we account for income taxes using the liability method in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for the temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of share based compensation expense deductions described above  tax credit carryforwards and deferred revenue 
in assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as of february   deferred tax assets totaled 
table of contents million  of which million was offset by a valuation allowance 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets with respect to certain foreign net operating loss nol carryforwards 
for further discussion regarding deferred income taxes see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
because tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations  significant judgment is required 
as a result  we make certain estimates and assumptions in i calculating our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  ii determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and iii evaluating the amount of unrecognized tax benefits  as well as the interest and penalties related to such uncertain tax positions 
our estimates and assumptions may differ significantly from tax benefits ultimately realized 
for further discussion regarding uncertain tax positions see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the course of conducting our business  including losses related to legal proceedings and claims brought against us 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required in evaluating both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a potential loss 
until the final resolution of a matter  there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded  and such amount could be material 
should any of our estimates or assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect  it could have a material impact on our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows

the remaining increase relates to both increased amortization expense of million related to technologies acquired either directly or as part of businesses acquired during the year ended february  and increased facilities costs of million related to our growing support staff 
as the number of open source technology subscriptions continues to increase  we expect associated support cost will continue to increase  although we anticipate this will occur at an overall slower rate than that of subscription revenue growth due to economies of scale

liquidity and capital resources we have historically derived a significant portion of our liquidity and operating capital from cash flows from operations as well as the sale of equity securities  including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial and follow on public offerings  and the issuance of convertible debentures 
at february   we had total cash and investments of billion  which was comprised of million in cash and cash equivalents  million of short term  available for sale fixed income investments  million of available for sale equity securities  million of long term  available for sale fixed income investments  and million in deposit accounts with maturity dates greater than days 
this compares to total cash and investments of billion at february  with million in cash and cash equivalents on hand  we believe our cash and cash equivalent balances  together with our ability to generate additional cash from operations  should be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
we generally intend to hold our short and long term investments in debt securities until their scheduled maturity dates 
however  in the event that we liquidate these investments prior to their scheduled maturities and there are adverse changes in market interest rates or the overall economic environment  we could be required to recognize a realized loss on those investments when we liquidate

at february  and february   the vast majority of our investments were priced with the assistance of pricing vendors 
these pricing vendors use the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or  if specific prices are not available for these securities  use other observable inputs 
in the event observable inputs are not available  we assess other factors to determine the securities market value  including broker quotes or model valuations 
independent price verifications of all of our holdings are performed by the pricing vendors  which we review 
in the event a price fails a pre established tolerance check  it is researched so that we can assess the cause of the variance to determine what we believe is the appropriate fair market value 

table of contents capital requirements we have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations  the development of our enterprise technologies  the expansion of our services operations and our acquisition activity 
our capital requirements during the year ending february  will depend on numerous factors  including the amount of resources we devote to funding the continued development of our enterprise technology offerings  accelerating the development of our systems management offerings  improving and extending our services and the technologies used to deliver these services to our customers and support our business  pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances  investing in businesses  products and technologies  and investing in enhancements to the systems we use to run our business and the expansion of our office facilities  including capital expenditures related to our current headquarters facility discussed in part i  item of this form k under the heading properties 
we have utilized  and will continue from time to time to utilize  cash and investments to fund  among other potential uses  purchases of our common stock  purchases of fixed assets  purchases of intellectual property and mergers and acquisitions 
given our historically strong operating cash flow and the billion of cash and investments held at february   we do not presently anticipate the need to raise cash to fund our operations  either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt  in the foreseeable future 
however  we may take advantage of favorable capital market situations that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital 
we believe that cash flow from operations will continue to improve  however  there can be no assurances that we will improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate or that such cash flows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make 
we may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans  which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means 
there can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us  if at all 
as of february   our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investment securities totaled billion  of which million was held outside the us our intent is to reinvest the earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely outside the us to fund both organic growth and acquisitions

with of our available cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments  as of february   held within the us  we do not anticipate a need to repatriate any foreign earnings for the foreseeable future

as of february   undistributed foreign earnings totaled million

for additional information  see our discussion in part i  item of this form k under the heading properties 
to the extent we cease to use any space in our previous headquarters facility prior to the expiration of the lease term  we plan to sublease such space to a third party and anticipate that sublease income would offset existing contractual obligations 
however  to the extent we are unable to sublease or otherwise dispose of such space and recover the full amount of our existing contractual obligation  we would be required to recognize a loss 
obligations under contracts that we may cancel without significant penalty are not included in the table above 
in addition  because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlements and any future payments related to uncertain tax positions  such liabilities are not included in the above table 
however  as of february   we have recognized a total of million related to such liabilities  which are included in other long term obligations on our consolidated balance sheet

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of our investments 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of fixed income securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in prevailing interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or perceived credit risk related to the securities issuers 
a hypothetical one half percentage point change in interest rates  assuming a parallel shift of all interest rates  would result in a million change in annual interest income derived from investments in our portfolio as of february  for further discussion related to our investments as of february  and february   see note summary of significant accounting policies and note assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis to our consolidated financial statements 
investment risk the fair market value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on this investment portfolio  a hypothetical one percentage increase in interest rates  assuming a parallel shift of all interest rates  would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment securities as of february  for further discussion related to our investments as of february  and february   see note summary of significant accounting policies and note assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis to our consolidated financial statements 
credit risk the fair market values of our investment portfolio and cash balances are exposed to counterparty credit risk 
accordingly  while we periodically review our portfolio in an effort to mitigate counterparty risk  the principal values of our cash balances  money market accounts and investments in available for sale securities could suffer a loss of value 
foreign currency risk approximately of our revenue for the year ended february  was produced by sales outside the united states 
we are exposed to significant risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from receivables denominated in foreign currency and are subject to transaction gains and losses  which are recorded as a component in determining net income 
the statements of operations of our non us operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period 
thus  to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency statements results in increased revenue and operating expenses for our non us operations 
similarly  our revenue and operating expenses for our non us operations decreases if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from our prior fiscal year ended february   our revenue and operating expenses from non us operations for the year ended february  would have been higher than we reported by approximately million and million  respectively  which would have resulted in income from operations being higher by million 

table of contents derivative instruments we transact business in various foreign countries and are  therefore  subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
from time to time we enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair market values in accordance with fasb asc section formerly referenced as statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company has elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation required to qualify its forward contracts for hedge accounting treatment and  therefore  changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
for further discussion related to our management of foreign currency risk see note derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
the aggregate notional amount of outstanding forward contracts at february  was million 
the fair value of these outstanding contracts at february  was a gross million asset and a gross million liability  and is recorded in other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses  respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 
the forward contracts generally expire within three months of the period ended february  the forward contracts will settle in argentine pesos  australian dollars  chilean pesos  czech koruna  danish krone  euros  israeli shekels  japanese yen  korean won  norwegian krona  singapore dollars  swedish krona  swiss francs  and us dollars 
the aggregate notional amount of outstanding forward contracts at february  was million
