critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of zoom consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires it to make estimates and judgments that affect its reported assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
zoom based its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
future events  however  may differ markedly from current expectations and assumptions 
while there are a number of significant accounting policies affecting zoom consolidated financial statements  we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most complex  difficult and subjective estimates and judgments allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  asset impairment

allowance for doubtful accounts zoom maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce amounts to their estimated realizable value 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when zoom assesses the realization of accounts receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts could be required 
zoom initially records a provision for doubtful accounts based on its historical experience  and then adjusts this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of its accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts  zoom considers i the aging of the accounts receivable  ii trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  iii the customer mix in each of the aging categories and the nature of the receivable  iv its historical provision for doubtful accounts  v the credit worthiness of the customer  and vi the economic conditions of the customer industry as well as general economic conditions  among other factors

under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the estimated tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts and each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized when  in management opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the provision for income taxes represents current taxes payable net of the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
zoom adopted fin asc topic  accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
zoom has engages tax preparers in all of the jurisdictions in which it operates to determine if the company is both fully compliant with applicable tax laws and is lawfully maximizing tax benefits to the company 
asset impairment zoom periodically evaluates the carrying value of other long lived assets  including  but not limited to  property and equipment and intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
significant estimates are utilized to calculate expected future cash flows utilized in impairment analyses 
zoom also utilizes judgment to determine other factors within fair value analyses  including the applicable discount rate
