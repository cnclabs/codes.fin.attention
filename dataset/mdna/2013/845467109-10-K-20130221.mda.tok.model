item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks described in the cautionary statement about forward looking statements below  in item a  risk factors in part i and elsewhere in this annual report 
you should read the following discussion with the item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this form k 
overview background southwestern energy company is an independent energy company engaged in natural gas and oil exploration  development and production  or e p 
we are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and marketing businesses  which we refer to as midstream services 
we operate principally in two segments e p and midstream services 
our primary business is the exploration for and production of natural gas and oil  with our current operations being principally focused within the united states on development of an unconventional gas reservoir located on the arkansas side of the arkoma basin  which we refer to as the fayetteville shale play 
we are also actively engaged in exploration and production activities in pennsylvania  where we are targeting the unconventional gas reservoir known as the marcellus shale  and to a lesser extent in texas and in arkansas and oklahoma in the arkoma basin 
we have recently commenced exploration operations in arkansas and louisiana testing an unconventional oil play targeting the lower smackover brown dense  or lsbd  formation  as well as in colorado and montana 
in  we commenced an exploration program in new brunswick  canada  which represents our first operations outside of the united states 
we are focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business 
we derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production of our e p business and expect this to continue in the future 
we expect that growth in our operating income and revenues will depend primarily on natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production 
we expect our natural gas production volumes will continue to increase due to our ongoing development of the fayetteville shale play in arkansas and the marcellus shale play in pennsylvania 
the price we expect to receive for our natural gas is a critical factor in the capital investments we make in order to develop our properties and increase our production 
in recent years  there has been a significant decline in natural gas prices as evidenced by new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  natural gas prices ranging from a high of per mmbtu in to a recent low of per mmbtu in april natural gas prices fluctuate due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict 
these factors  which include increased supplies of natural gas due to greater exploration and development activities  weather conditions  political and economic events  and competition from other energy sources  impact supply and demand for natural gas  which in turn determines the sale prices for our production 
in addition to the factors identified above  the prices we realize for our production are affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices 
recent financial and operating results due to a significant non cash ceiling test impairment of our united states natural gas properties in  we reported a net loss attributable to southwestern energy of million  or per diluted share  down from net income attributable to southwestern energy of million  or per diluted share in we reported net income attributable to southwestern energy of million  or per diluted share  in in  we incurred a  million  or  million net of taxes  non cash ceiling test impairment of our united states natural gas and oil properties that resulted from a significant decline in natural gas prices during our cash flow from operating activities decreased to  million in due to a decrease in net income adjusted for non cash expenses which was partially offset by changes in working capital accounts  and increased to  million in due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash expenses which was partially offset by changes in working capital 
in  our natural gas and oil production increased to bcfe  up from bcfe in the bcfe increase in our production resulted from a bcf increase in net production from our fayetteville shale play  a bcf increase in net production from our marcellus shale properties and a bcfe increase in net production in our new ventures properties  which more than offset a combined bcfe decrease in net production from our east texas and arkoma basin properties 
in  our natural gas and oil production increased to bcfe  up from bcfe in we are targeting natural gas and oil production of to bcfe  an increase of approximately over our production  using midpoints 
our year end reserves decreased in to  bcfe  down from  bcfe at the end of and  bcfe at the end of  primarily due to the low natural gas price environment 
our e p segment reported an operating loss of  million in  down from operating income of million in the operating loss in included a  million non cash ceiling test impairment of our united states natural gas and oil properties 
excluding the non cash ceiling test impairment  operating income in decreased million over as the revenue impact of our increase in production was more than offset by the decline in our average realized natural gas prices and a million increase in operating costs and expenses that resulted from our significant production growth 
operating income of million in decreased million over as the revenue impact of our increase in production was more than offset by the decline in our average realized natural gas prices and a million increase in operating costs that resulted from our significant production growth 
operating income for our midstream services segment was million in  up from million in and million in operating income for our midstream services segment increased in due to an increase of million in gathering revenues  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities and million increase in operating costs and expenses  exclusive of natural gas purchase costs  that resulted from our continued significant growth in volumes gathered 
volumes gathered grew to bcf in compared to bcf in operating income for our midstream services segment increased in due to an increase of million in gathering revenues and an increase of million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities  which were partially offset by a million increase in operating costs and expenses  exclusive of natural gas purchase costs  that resulted from our significant growth in volumes gathered 
volumes gathered grew to bcf in compared to bcf in we had total capital investments of  million in  compared to  million in and  million in of our total capital investments   million was invested in our e p segment in compared to  million and  million invested in our e p segment in and  respectively 
outlook we believe the outlook for our business is favorable despite the continued uncertainty of natural gas prices in the united states and the legislative and regulatory challenges facing our industry 
our resource base  financial strength and disciplined investment of capital provide us with an opportunity to exploit and develop our position in the fayetteville shale play and marcellus shale play  maximize efficiency through economies of scale in our key operating areas  enhance our overall returns through expansion of our midstream services operations and grow through new exploration and development activities 
our capital investment plan for is flexible and is based on our expectation that natural gas prices will remain at current price levels 
should prices fluctuate materially from their current levels we will adjust our capital investment plans accordingly 
results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations for our segments is presented before intersegment eliminations 
we evaluate our segments as if they were stand alone operations and accordingly discuss their results prior to any intersegment eliminations 
interest expense  interest income  income tax expense and stock based compensation are discussed on a consolidated basis 
exploration and production year ended december  revenues in thousands impairment of natural gas and oil properties in thousands operating costs and expenses in thousands operating income loss in thousands natural gas production bcf oil production mbbls total production bcfe average gas price per mcf  including hedges average gas price per mcf  excluding hedges average oil price per bbl average unit costs per mcfe lease operating expenses general administrative expenses taxes  other than income taxes full cost pool amortization revenues revenues for our e p segment were down million  or  in compared to higher natural gas production volumes in increased revenues by million while lower realized prices for our natural gas production decreased revenue by million compared to e p revenues were up million  or  in compared to higher natural gas production volumes in increased revenues by million while lower realized prices for our natural gas production decreased revenue by million 
we expect our natural gas production volumes to continue to increase due to our development of the fayetteville shale properties in arkansas and our marcellus shale properties in pennsylvania 
natural gas and oil prices are difficult to predict and subject to wide price fluctuations 
as of february   we had hedged bcf of our remaining natural gas production and bcf of our natural gas production to help limit our exposure to price fluctuations 
for more information about our derivatives and risk management activities  we refer you to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k and to commodity prices below for additional information 
production in  our natural gas and oil production increased to bcfe  up from bcfe in the bcfe increase in our production resulted from a bcf increase in net production from our fayetteville shale play  a bcf increase in net production from our marcellus shale properties and a increase in net production in our new ventures properties  which more than offset a combined bcfe decrease in net production from our east texas and arkoma basin properties 
natural gas and oil production was up approximately to bcfe in  as compared to  due to a bcf increase in net production from our fayetteville shale play and a bcf increase in net production from our marcellus shale properties  which more than offset a combined bcfe decrease in net production from our east texas and arkoma basin properties 
our net production from the fayetteville shale play was bcf in  up from bcf in and bcf in we are targeting natural gas and oil production of to bcfe  an increase of approximately over our production  using midpoints 
approximately to bcf of our targeted natural gas production is projected to come from our activities in the fayetteville shale play 
although we expect production volumes in to increase  we cannot guarantee our success in discovering  developing and producing reserves 
our ability to discover  develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the availability of capital  the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition 
there are also many risks inherent in the discovery  development and production of natural gas and oil 
we refer you to risk factors in item a of part i of this form k for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations 
commodity prices the average price realized for our natural gas production  including the effects of hedges  decreased to per mcf in and decreased to per mcf in the decrease in the average price realized in compared to primarily reflects the decrease in average market prices  which was partially offset by the positive effect of our price hedging activities in see additional discussion below 
the decrease in the average price realized in compared to primarily reflects the decrease in average market prices and to a lesser extent the decreased effect of our natural gas price hedging activities  which had a greater positive impact on our average realized natural gas price in we periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations  including fluctuations in locational market differentials 
we refer you to item a of this form k  note to the consolidated financial statements  and our hedge risk factor for additional discussion about our derivatives and risk management activities 
our hedging activities increased the average natural gas sales price we realized by per mcf in  compared to an increase of per mcf in and an increase of per mcf in disregarding the impact of hedges  the average sales price we received for our natural gas production in was per mcf lower than and lower than the average monthly nymex settlement price for as of december   we had basis hedges on approximately bcf of our expected natural gas production through financial hedging activities and physical sales arrangements at a basis differential to nymex natural gas prices of approximately per mcf 
in addition to the basis hedges discussed above  as of december   we had nymex fixed price hedges in place on notional volumes of bcf of our remaining natural gas production at an average price of per mmbtu 
as of december   we had nymex fixed price hedges in place on notional volumes of bcf of our natural gas production 
our e p segment receives a sales price for our natural gas at a discount to average monthly nymex settlement prices due to locational basis differentials  while transportation charges and fuel charges also reduce the price received 
assuming a nymex commodity price of per mcf for  and disregarding the impact of hedges  we expect our total natural gas sales discount to nymex to be to per mcf for we realized an average sales price of per barrel for our oil production for the year ended december   up approximately from the prior year 
the average realized price of per barrel was up from we did not hedge any of our  or oil production 
operating income our e p segment reported an operating loss of  million in  down from operating income of million in the operating loss in included a  million non cash ceiling test impairment of our united states natural gas and oil properties 
excluding the  million non cash ceiling test impairment  operating income in decreased million over as the revenue impact of our increase in production was more than offset by the decline in our average realized natural gas prices and a million increase in operating costs and expenses that resulted from our significant production growth 
operating income of million in decreased million over as the revenue impact of our increase in production was more than offset by the decline in our average realized natural gas prices and a million increase in operating costs that resulted from our significant production growth 
operating costs and expenses lease operating expenses per mcfe for the e p segment were in  compared to in and in lease operating expenses per unit of production decreased in primarily due to lower compression and salt water disposal costs associated with our fayetteville shale operations 
lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in compared to primarily due to increased gathering  compression and water disposal costs associated with our fayetteville shale operations 
we expect our per unit operating cost for this segment to range between and per mcfe in general and administrative expenses for the e p segment were per mcfe in  down from per mcfe in and per mcfe in the decreases in general and administrative costs per mcfe in and were due to decreased personnel costs per unit of production 
in total  general and administrative expenses for the e p segment were million in  million in and million in the increases in general and administrative expenses since was primarily a result of increased personnel and information system costs associated with the expansion of our e p operations 
these increases accounted for million  or  of the increase and million  or  of the increase 
we added new e p employees during compared to employees added in we expect our per unit cost for general and administrative expenses in to range between and per mcfe 
the expected increase in our per unit general and administrative costs in is due to general increases in personnel costs associated with ongoing development of our fayetteville shale and marcellus shale plays 
future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon compensation and other personnel costs and level and intensity of our operating activities 
for eligible employees  a portion of incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and performance results  including production  proved reserve additions  present value added for each dollar of capital invested  and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses per unit of production  while another portion is discretionary based upon an employee s performance 
taxes other than income taxes per mcfe were in and in each of and in  we incurred a new pennsylvania well impact fee charged to all of our wells spud in the marcellus shale play 
taxes other than income taxes per mcfe vary from period to period due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the mix of our production volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices 
our full cost pool amortization rate averaged per mcfe for  per mcfe for and per mcfe for the increase in the average amortization rate for compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in proved reserves associated with lower prices in and the sale of certain east texas properties in and the decline in the average amortization rate for compared to was primarily the result of lower acquisition and development costs and sale of certain east texas properties in and the amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions  revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance  write downs that result from full cost ceiling tests  proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization 
we cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above  as well as other factors  including but not limited to the uncertainty of the amount of future reserves attributed to our fayetteville shale and marcellus shale plays 
unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were  million at the end of compared to million at the end of and million at the end of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization at the end of included million related to our properties in canada 
the increase in unevaluated costs since december  primarily resulted from a million increase in our drilling activity in our wells in progress  offset slightly by a million decrease in undeveloped leasehold acreage and seismic costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our unevaluated costs excluded from amortization 
the timing and amount of production and reserve additions could have a material impact on our per unit costs  if production or reserves additions are lower than projected  our per unit costs could increase 
midstream services year ended december  in millions revenues marketing revenues gathering gas purchases marketing operating costs and expenses operating income gas volumes marketed bcf gas volumes gathered bcf revenues revenues from our marketing activities were down to  million for compared to the decrease in marketing revenues resulted from a decrease in the prices received for volumes marketed  which was partially offset by an increase in volumes marketed 
revenues from our marketing activities were up to  million for compared to the increase in marketing revenues for resulted from increases in the volumes marketed which partially offset a decrease in the prices received for volumes marketed 
the average price received for volumes marketed decreased in compared to  and decreased in compared to volumes marketed increased in compared to  and increased in compared to of the total volumes marketed  production from our e p operated wells accounted for in  in and in increases and decreases in marketing revenues due to changes in commodity prices are largely offset by corresponding changes in natural gas purchase expenses 
revenues from our gathering activities were up to million for compared to  and were up to million for compared to the increases in gathering revenues primarily resulted from a increase in natural gas volumes gathered in compared to and a increase in natural gas volumes gathered in compared to the majority of the increases in gathering revenues for and resulted from increases in the volumes gathered from our operated production from the fayetteville shale play 
operating income operating income from our midstream services segment increased to million in and increased to million in the increases in operating income reflect the substantial increases in natural gas volumes gathered and marketed which resulted primarily from our increased e p production volumes 
the increase in operating income for compared to was due to an increase of million in gathering revenues  which was partially offset by a decrease of million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities and a million increase in operating costs and expenses  exclusive of purchased natural gas costs  associated with the increase in natural gas volumes gathered 
the increase in operating income for compared to was due to a million increase in gathering revenues and an increase of million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities  which were partially offset by a million increase in operating costs and expenses  exclusive of purchased natural gas costs associated with the increase in natural gas volumes gathered 
the margin generated from natural gas marketing activities was million for  compared to million for and million for margins are driven primarily by volumes of natural gas marketed and may fluctuate depending on the prices paid for commodities and the ultimate disposition of those commodities 
the increases in margins generated are primarily the result of a increase in volumes marketed in and a increase in volumes marketed in  as compared to prior years  resulting from marketing our increased e p production volumes 
we enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our natural gas marketing activities to provide margin protection 
for more information about our derivatives and risk management activities  we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interest expense interest expense  net of capitalization  was million in  an increase of million compared to  primarily due to our increased borrowing level  partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest 
interest capitalized increased to million in from million in  primarily due to an increase in our unevaluated property balance during interest expense  net of capitalization  was million in  a decrease of million compared to  primarily due to a increase in capitalized interest 
interest capitalized increased to million in from million in  primarily due to an increase in our weighted average interest rate and average borrowed balance under our credit facility during  which had a weighted average interest rate of for and an increase in our unevaluated properties 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in and in and the effective tax rate is lower in primarily due to the  million non cash impairment of our natural gas and oil properties and state income taxes 
in general  differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate of primarily result from the effect of certain state income taxes and permanent items attributable to book tax differences 
stock based compensation expense we recognized expense of million and capitalized million for stock based compensation in  compared to million expensed and million capitalized in and million expensed and million capitalized in we refer you to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our equity based compensation plans 
liquidity and capital resources we depend primarily on internally generated funds  our revolving credit facility  sales of non core assets and funds accessed through debt and equity markets as our primary sources of liquidity 
during  assuming natural gas prices remain at current levels  we expect to draw on a portion of the funds available under our revolving credit facility to fund the portion of our planned capital investments discussed below under capital investments  that are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations 
we refer you to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k and the section below under financing requirements for additional discussion of our revolving credit facility 
as of december   our capital structure consisted of debt and equity 
we believe that our operating cash flow and available funds under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for the credit status of the financial institutions participating in our revolving credit facility could adversely impact our ability to borrow funds under the revolving credit facility 
while we believe all of the lenders under the facility have the ability to provide funds  we cannot predict whether each will be able to meet its obligation 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to billion in  due to a decrease in net income adjusted for non cash expenses which was partially offset by changes in working capital accounts 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to billion in over due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash expenses which was partially offset by changes in working capital accounts 
for  requirements for our capital investments were funded from our cash generated by operating activities  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  billion issuance of senior notes and the proceeds from the sale of certain east texas oil and natural gas properties 
net cash from operating activities provided of our cash requirements for capital investments in  in and in our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive for our natural gas and oil production 
natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations and are driven by market supply and demand factors which are impacted by the overall state of the economy 
the sales price we receive for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities  as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our commodity hedging activities are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties being financially unable to complete the transaction 
we actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties  performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable  and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions 
however  any future failures by one or more counterparties could negatively impact our cash flow from operating activities 
additionally  our short term cash flows are dependent on the timely collection of receivables from our customers and partners 
we actively manage this risk through credit management activities and  through the date of this filing  have not experienced any significant write offs for non collectable amounts 
however  any sustained inaccessibility of credit by our customers and partners could adversely impact our cash flows 
due to the above factors  we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations 
accordingly  we will adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon available cash flow 
capital investments our capital investments were billion in  down from billion in capital investments include a decrease of million in  an increase of million in and an increase of million in related to the change in accrued expenditures between years 
our e p segment investments in were billion  compared to billion in and billion in in thousands exploration and production midstream services other our capital investments for are planned to be billion  consisting of approximately billion for e p  million for midstream services and million for corporate and other purposes 
of the approximate billion  we expect to allocate approximately million to our fayetteville shale play 
our planned level of capital investments in is expected to allow us to continue our progress in the fayetteville shale and marcellus shale programs and explore and develop other existing natural gas and oil properties and generate new drilling prospects 
as discussed above  our capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the planned capital program for is flexible and can be modified 
we will reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into account prevailing market conditions and  if natural gas prices change significantly in  we could change our planned investments 
financing requirements our total debt outstanding was  million as of december   compared to  million at december  in february  we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility  increasing the borrowing capacity to billion and extending the maturity date to february the amount available under the revolving credit facility may be increased to billion at any time upon the our agreement with its existing or additional lenders 
we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december  and had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december  the interest rate on our revolving credit facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently basis points over libor 
at february   our publicly traded notes are rated bbb by standard and poor s and we have a corporate family rating of baa by moody s 
any downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase our cost of funds under our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us 
under our revolving credit facility  we must keep our total debt at or below of our total capital  and must maintain a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of or above 
our revolving credit facility s financial covenants with respect to capitalization percentages exclude the noncontrolling interest in equity  the effects of non cash entries that result from any full cost ceiling impairments  hedging activities and our pension and other postretirement liabilities 
therefore  under our revolving credit facility  our capital structure as of december  would have been debt and equity 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our revolving credit facility as of december  although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants  our ability to comply with those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as the market prices for natural gas and oil 
if we are unable to borrow under our revolving credit facility  we would have to decrease our capital investment plans 
in march  we issued billion of senior notes due a portion of the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
as of december   our capital structure consisted of debt and equity compared to debt and equity at december  our debt percentage of total capital as of december  increased in  primarily due to a million non cash ceiling test impairment of our united states natural gas and oil properties 
equity as of december  included an accumulated other comprehensive gain of million related to our hedging activities and an accumulated other comprehensive loss for million related to our pension and other postretirement liabilities 
the amount recorded in equity for our hedging activities is based on current market values for our hedges as of december  and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive or pay when the hedges are ultimately settled  nor does it take into account revenues to be received associated with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged 
our hedges allow us to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations 
at february   we had nymex commodity price hedges in place on bcf  or approximately of our targeted natural gas production and bcf of our expected natural gas production 
the amount of long term debt we incur will be dependent upon commodity prices and our capital investment plans 
off balance sheet arrangements we may enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the company s material off balance sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements 
there are no other transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of or capital resources 
for more information regarding off balance sheet arrangements  we refer you to contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments below 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities 
significant contractual obligations as of december   were as follows contractual obligations payments due by period less than more than total year to years to years years in thousands demand charges debt interest on senior notes operating leases operating agreements compression services purchase obligations other obligations as of december   our midstream services segment had commitments for demand transportation charges on various pipelines  including approximately billion related to the fep pipeline and billion related to the boardwalk pipeline 
operating leases include costs for compressors  aircraft  vehicles  office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring through additionally  this includes million for leases of drilling rigs and related equipment through and million for pressure pumping equipment for its e p operations through as of december   our e p segment had commitments for approximately million to companies for fracture stimulation services  which are cancellable under certain circumstances 
as of december   our midstream services segment had commitments of approximately million and our e p segment had commitments of approximately million for compression services associated primarily with our fayetteville shale play operations 
in conjunction with our exploration program in new brunswick  canada  we provided promissory notes payable on demand to the minister of finance of the province of new brunswick with an aggregate principal amount of cad million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our commitments related to our exploration program in canada 
our other significant contractual obligations include approximately million for asset retirement obligations primarily relating to oil and natural gas properties  approximately million for funding of benefit plans  approximately million for various information technology support and data subscription agreements  approximately million for insurance premium financing and approximately million related to seismic services 
we refer you to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of our debt 
commitments and contingent liabilities substantially all of our employees are covered by defined benefit and postretirement benefit plans 
we currently expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plans and million to our postretirement benefit plan in for  we contributed million to our pension plans and contributed million to our postretirement benefit plan 
as of december  we recognized a liability of million as a result of the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans compared to a liability of million at december  for further information regarding our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  we refer you to note to the consolidated financial statements and critical accounting policies below for additional information 
working capital we maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our revolving credit facility described in financing requirements above 
we had positive working capital of million as of december  and positive working capital of million at december  current assets decreased million during primarily due to a million decrease in our current hedging asset and million decrease in inventory  which was partially offset by a million increase in cash and cash equivalents 
current liabilities decreased million primarily due to a million decrease in our current deferred income taxes related to our hedging activities and million decrease in accounts payable  offset slightly by a million increase in taxes payable 
natural gas in underground storage we currently have one facility owned by our e p segment that contains natural gas in underground storage 
natural gas in storage that is expected to be cycled within the next months is recorded in current assets 
this current portion of natural gas in storage is classified as inventory and is carried at the lower of cost or market 
as of december  and  the current portion of natural gas in storage was million and million  respectively 
the non current portion of natural gas in storage is classified in property and equipment and carried at cost 
the carrying value of the non current natural gas is evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable 
the natural gas in inventory for the e p segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segment s contractual commitments  especially during periods of colder weather 
in determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas  we utilize the natural gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our natural gas in inventory 
a significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could require a write down of our natural gas in underground storage carrying cost 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
natural gas and oil properties we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration  development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized on a country by country basis and amortized over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs  net of applicable deferred taxes  to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at standardized measure plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
companies using the full cost method are required to use the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous months  including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges  to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves 
using the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous months for henry hub natural gas of per mmbtu and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  adjusted for market differentials  our net book value of its united states natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling amount and resulted in a ceiling test impairment as of december  our net book value of its united states natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling by approximately million net of tax as of december  and resulted in a non cash ceiling test impairment 
cash flow hedges of natural gas production in place increased this ceiling amount by approximately million as of december  our net book value of its united states natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling by approximately million net of tax at september  and resulted in a non cash ceiling test impairment 
cash flow hedges of natural gas production in place increased the ceiling by million at september  in the second quarter of  our net book value of its united states natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling by approximately million net of tax at june  and resulted in a non cash ceiling test impairment 
cash flow hedges of natural gas production in place increased the ceiling by million at june  decreases in market prices as well as changes in production rates  levels of reserves  evaluation of costs excluded from amortization  future development costs and production costs could result in future ceiling test impairments 
all of our costs directly associated with the acquisition and evaluation of properties in canada as of december  were unproved and did not exceed the ceiling amount 
if our exploration program in canada is unsuccessful on all or a portion of these properties  a ceiling test impairment may result in the future 
natural gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and projections of cost that will be incurred in developing and producing reserves and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management 
reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team to which the property is assigned 
the reservoir engineering and financial data included in these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and our manager capital budgeting reserves  who was the technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of our reserve estimates  and has over ten years of experience in petroleum engineering  including the estimation of oil and natural gas reserves 
he reports to our senior vice president corporate development  who has more than years of experience in reservoir engineering  including the estimation of oil and natural gas reserves in multiple basins  both in the united states and internationally 
on our behalf  the senior vice president corporate development engages nsai  a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies  to independently audit our proved reserves estimates as discussed in more detail below 
the financial data included in the reserve estimates are also separately reviewed by our accounting staff 
following these reviews and the audit  the reserve estimates are submitted by our senior vice president corporate development to our chief executive officer for his review and approval prior to the presentation to our board of directors 
nsai reports the results of its reserve audit to the board of directors with whom final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests 
proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process  when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves  as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties 
proved developed reserves accounted for of our total reserve base as of december  assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control 
we refer you to although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited  our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate in item a  risk factors  of part i of this form k for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties  risks and other factors 
in conducting its audit  the engineers and geologists of nsai study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates 
nsai s audit consists primarily of substantive testing  which includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately of present worth of the company s total proved reserves 
nsai s audit process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected fields account for more than of the present worth of our reserves 
the properties in the bottom of the total present worth are not reviewed in the audit 
the fields included in approximately the top present value as of december   accounted for approximately of our total proved reserves and approximately of our proved undeveloped reserves 
in the conduct of its audit  nsai did not independently verify the data we provided to them with respect to ownership interests  oil and natural gas production  well test data  historical costs of operation and development  product prices  or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production 
nsai has advised us that if  in the course of its audit  something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data  nsai did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data 
on january   nsai issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates for the year ended december   stating that our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves are  in the aggregate  reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 
a decline in natural gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported 
our reserve base is nearly natural gas  therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as natural gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities 
our standardized measure and reserve quantities as of december   were  million and  bcfe  respectively 
an assumed decrease of per mcf in the average natural gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate  million decline in our standardized measure and an approximate decrease of  bcfe of our reported reserves 
the unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates  capitalized costs and future development costs 
hedging we use natural gas and oil swap agreements and options to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil 
our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability 
we actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties  performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable  and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions 
from through  we established a portfolio of hedges relating to approximately to of our annual production 
in   and we hedged  and of our production 
the primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and oil 
however  the market price risk is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related natural gas or oil transaction that is hedged 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our financial statements and generally qualify for hedge accounting 
we have established the fair value of derivative instruments using data provided by our counterparties in conjunction with assumptions evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
these valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and  to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production  the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income 
results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales 
any derivative not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment or any ineffective portion of a properly designated hedge is recognized immediately in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recorded an unrealized gain of million related to basis differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting in addition to a million loss related to the change in call option positions and estimated ineffectiveness of our commodity cash flow hedges 
future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of part ii of this form k for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
pension and other postretirement benefits we record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost  as well as our periodic benefit cost  for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans 
two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate  which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled  and the expected return on plan assets  which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
for the december  benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in  the discount rate assumed is 
for the periodic benefit cost  the expected return assumed is 
this compares to a discount rate of and an expected return of used in using the assumed rates discussed above  we recorded total benefit cost of million in related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
due to the significance of the discount rate and expected long term rate of return  the following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the effect that a basis point change in those assumptions would have had on our pension expense increase decrease of annual pension expense basis point increase basis point decrease in thousands discount rate expected long term rate of return as of december   we recognized a liability of million  compared to million at december   related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
during  we also made cash payments totaling million to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
in  we expect to make cash payments totaling million to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and recognize pension expense of million and a postretirement benefit expense of million

cautionary statement about forward looking statements all statements  other than historical fact or present financial information  may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
all statements that address activities  outcomes and other matters that should or may occur in the future  including  without limitation  statements regarding the financial position  business strategy  production and reserve growth and other plans and objectives for our future operations  are forward looking statements 
although we believe the expectations expressed in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  such statements are not guarantees of future performance 
we have no obligation and make no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  except as may be required by law 
forward looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph  information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements in this form k identified by words such as anticipate  project  intend  estimate  expect  believe  predict  budget  projection  goal  plan  forecast  target or similar expressions 
you should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
they are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may affect our operations  markets  products  services and prices and cause our actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with forward looking statements  risks  uncertainties and factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward looking statement include  but are not limited to the timing and extent of changes in market conditions and prices for natural gas and oil including regional basis differentials  our ability to fund our planned capital investments  our ability to transport our production to the most favorable markets or at all  the timing and extent of our success in discovering  developing  producing and estimating reserves  the economic viability of  and our success in drilling  our large acreage position in the fayetteville shale play overall as well as relative to other productive shale natural gas plays  the impact of government regulation  including any increase in severance or similar taxes  legislation relating to hydraulic fracturing  the climate and over the counter derivatives  the costs and availability of oilfield personnel  services and drilling supplies  raw materials  and equipment  including pressure pumping equipment and crews  our ability to determine the most effective and economic fracture stimulation for the fayetteville shale play and marcellus shale play  our future property acquisition or divestiture activities  the impact of the adverse outcome of any material litigation against us  the effects of weather  increased competition and regulation  the financial impact of accounting regulations and critical accounting policies  the comparative cost of alternative fuels  conditions in capital markets  changes in interest rates and the ability of our lenders to provide us with funds as agreed  credit risk relating to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties  and any other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file with the securities and exchange commission sec 
we caution you that forward looking statements contained in this form k are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  incident to the exploration for and development  production and sale of natural gas and oil 
these risks include  but are not limited to  commodity price volatility  third party interruption of sales to market  inflation  lack of availability of goods and services  environmental risks  drilling and other operating risks  regulatory changes  the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in item a of part i of this form k 
estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves in this form k are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to natural gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital investments  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  those estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  natural gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development costs  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated 
such variances may be material 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this form k 
our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
as of december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and were proved developed non producing 
proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves  by their nature  are less certain than proved developed producing reserves 
estimates of reserves in the non producing categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the performance data used to estimate producing reserves 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
recovery of proved developed non producing reserves requires capital expenditures to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is subject to the risk of a successful recompletion 
production revenues from proved undeveloped and proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized  if at all  until sometime in the future 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital investments to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this form k is the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on average prices over the preceding twelve months and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in consumption by natural gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for our company 
should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this form k occur  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
we specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward looking statement or any forward looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages 
all forward looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices  basis differentials and interest rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
we use natural gas and oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates 
our board of directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price risk 
utilization of financial products for the reduction of interest rate risks is subject to the approval of our board of directors 
these policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings 
credit risk our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our customers and their dispersion across geographic areas 
no single customer accounted for greater than of revenues as of december  see commodities risk below for discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading 
interest rate risk the following table presents the principal cash payments for our debt obligations and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of december  as of december   we had  million of total debt with a weighted average interest rate of and we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when deemed appropriate 
we do not have any interest rate swaps in effect currently 
expected maturity date fair value thereafter total in millions fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate commodities risk we use over the counter natural gas and oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production and to hedge activity in our midstream services segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the nymex futures market 
these swaps and options include transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price or variable price for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price or fixed price based on a published index referred to as price swaps  transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices referred to as basis swaps and the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls collars that provide a floor price  below which the counterparty pays funds equal to the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor  and a ceiling price above which we pay to the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling 
the primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and oil 
however  the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties 
the counterparties are primarily major commercial banks  investment banks  and integrated energy companies which management believes present minimal credit risks 
the credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit risk exposure 
additionally  we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable 
we have not incurred any counterparty losses related to non performance and do not anticipate any losses given the information we have currently 
however  we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future 
exploration and production the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices and that are used to hedge prices for natural gas production 
the table presents the notional amount in bcf  the weighted average contract prices and the fair value by expected maturity dates 
as of december   the fair value of our financial instruments related to natural gas production and gas in storage was a million asset 
weighted weighted weighted average average average fair value at price to be call basis december  volume swapped fixed price differential bcf mmbtu mmbtu mmbtu in millions natural gas fixed price swaps basis swaps fixed price call options as of december   our basis swaps and call options did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in natural gas and oil sales 
for the year ended december   we recorded an unrealized gain of million related to the basis swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and an unrealized loss of million related to the change in our call option positions and estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges 
typically  our hedge ineffectiveness results from changes at the end of a reporting period in the price differentials between the index price of the derivative contract  which is primarily a nymex price  and the index price for the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged 
additionally  at december   we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on bcf of  bcf of and bcf of natural gas production that did not qualify for hedge treatment
