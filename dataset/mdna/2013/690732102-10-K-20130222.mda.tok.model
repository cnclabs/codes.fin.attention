capital resources 
our sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents and a revolving credit facility 
on june   we entered into a five year million credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na  jpmorgan chase bank  na and a syndicate of financial institutions the credit agreement 
this agreement replaced an existing million credit agreement set to expire on june  under the new credit facility  we have the ability to request two one year extensions and to request an increase in aggregate commitments by up to million 
the interest rate on the new credit facility  which is subject to adjustment quarterly  is based on the london interbank offered rate libor  the federal funds rate or the prime rate  plus an adjustment based on the better of our debt ratings or leverage ratio credit spread as defined by the credit agreement 
we are charged a commitment fee of between and basis points on the unused portion of the facility 
the terms of the credit agreement limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and require us to maintain ratios for leverage and interest coverage  including on a pro forma basis in the event of an acquisition 
at december   we had no borrowings and letters of credit of million outstanding on the revolving credit facility  leaving million available for borrowing 
we may utilize the revolving credit facility for long term strategic growth  capital expenditures  working capital and general corporate purposes 
if we were unable to access the revolving credit facility  it could impact our ability to fund these needs 
during  we had no borrowings or repayments under the credit facilities 
based on our leverage ratio at december   the interest rate under the new credit facility is libor plus 
we have million of senior notes outstanding  which mature in and bear interest at  payable semi annually on april and october the revolving credit facility and senior notes contain cross default provisions which could result in the acceleration of payments due in the event of default of either agreement 
we believe we were in compliance with the debt covenants at december  we earn a portion of our operating earnings in foreign jurisdictions outside the us  which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested 
accordingly  no us federal and state income taxes and withholding taxes have been provided on these earnings 
our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled million as of december  we do not intend  nor do we foresee a need  to repatriate these funds or other assets held outside the us in the future  should we require more capital to fund discretionary activities in the us than is generated by our domestic operations and is available through our borrowings  we could elect to repatriate cash or other assets from foreign jurisdictions that have previously been considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
upon distribution of these assets  we could be subject to additional us federal and state income taxes and withholding taxes payable to foreign jurisdictions  where applicable 
we paid quarterly cash dividends on our outstanding common stock at the rate of per share during  per share during  and per share during our annual dividend payout ratio for the three years ended december   based on adjusted eps  was in the range of to 
in february  the board of directors approved a increase in the amount of our quarterly dividend to per common share 
we anticipate continuing to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future 
however  the payment of future dividends remains within the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors 
in february  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of our outstanding common stock to be executed at the discretion of management over a three year period  expiring in february the program is intended to offset shares issued in conjunction with our stock incentive plan and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
during  we repurchased approximately  shares at million under this program 
at december   we had up to million remaining under our share repurchase authorization 
we believe available financing sources  including cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures  long term strategic growth  payments under long term debt and lease arrangements  payments of quarterly cash dividends  share repurchases and other cash requirements 
while we believe that we will have the ability to meet our financing needs in the foreseeable future  changes in economic conditions may impact i the ability of financial institutions to meet their contractual commitments to us  ii the ability of our customers and suppliers to meet their obligations to us or iii our cost of borrowing 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have guarantees or other off balance sheet financing arrangements  including variable interest entities  which we believe could have a material impact on financial condition or liquidity

other long term liabilities include estimated minimum required payments for our unfunded retirement plan for certain officers 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain long term liabilities  including deferred tax liabilities and post retirement benefit obligations  are excluded as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of payments for these items 
excludes certain contingent contractual obligations that are required to be paid in the event that performance targets specified by customer contracts are not achieved 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that relate to estimates that require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on our results due to changes in the estimate or the use of different assumptions that could reasonably have been used 
our estimates are generally based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are judged to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ 
we believe our critical accounting policies and estimates include allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable  inventory valuation  accounting for goodwill and long lived assets  self insurance liabilities  supplier incentives  and business combinations 
allowances for losses on accounts and notes receivable 
we maintain valuation allowances based upon the expected collectability of accounts and notes receivable 
the allowances include specific amounts for accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as customer bankruptcies and disputed amounts  and general allowances for accounts that may become uncollectible 
these allowances are estimated based on a number of factors  including industry trends  current economic conditions  creditworthiness of customers  age of the receivables  changes in customer payment patterns  and historical experience 
at december   accounts and notes receivable were million  net of allowances of million 
an unexpected bankruptcy or other adverse change in the financial condition of a customer could result in increases in these allowances  which could have a material effect on the results of operations 

table of contents inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the last in  first out lifo method for domestic segment inventories and the first in  first out fifo method for international segment inventories 
an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made only at the end of the year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time 
lifo calculations are required for interim reporting purposes and are based on estimates of the expected mix of products in year end inventory 
in addition  inventory valuation includes estimates of allowances for obsolescence and variances between actual inventory on hand and perpetual inventory records that can arise between physical inventory dates 
these estimates are based on factors such as the age of inventory and historical trends 
at december   the carrying value of inventory was million  which is million less than the value of inventory had it all been accounted for on a fifo basis 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
long lived assets  which are a component of identifiable net assets  include intangible assets with finite useful lives  property and equipment  and computer software costs 
intangible assets with finite useful lives consist primarily of customer relationships and non compete agreements acquired through business combinations 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events occur or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in performing the impairment test  we perform qualitative assessments based on macroeconomic conditions  structural changes in the industry  estimated financial performance  and other relevant information 
if necessary  we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using valuation techniques which can include comparable multiples of the reporting unit s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and discounted cash flows 
the ebitda multiples are based on an analysis of current enterprise valuations and recent acquisition prices of similar companies  if available 
the carrying value of the reporting unit is then compared to its fair value to determine potential impairment 
goodwill totaled million at december  long lived assets  which exclude goodwill  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we assess long lived assets for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of an asset  or group of related assets  to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
at december   long lived assets included property and equipment of million  net of accumulated depreciation  intangible assets of million  net of accumulated amortization  and computer software costs of million  net of accumulated amortization 
we did not record any material impairment losses related to goodwill or long lived assets in however  the impairment review of goodwill and long lived assets requires the extensive use of accounting judgment  estimates and assumptions 
the application of alternative assumptions could produce materially different results 
self insurance liabilities 
we are self insured for most employee healthcare  workers compensation and automobile liability costs  however  we maintain insurance for individual losses exceeding certain limits 
liabilities are estimated for healthcare costs using current and historical claims data 
liabilities for workers compensation and automobile liability claims are estimated using historical claims data and loss development factors 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of existing claims change or historical trends are not indicative of future trends  then we may be required to record additional expense that could have a material effect on the results of operations 
self insurance liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for employee healthcare  workers compensation and automobile liability costs totaled million at december  supplier incentives 
we have contractual arrangements with certain suppliers that provide incentives  including operational efficiency and performance based incentives  on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
these incentives are recognized as a reduction in cost of goods sold as targets become probable of achievement 
supplier incentives receivable are recorded for interim and annual reporting purposes and are based on our estimate of the amounts which are expected to be realized 
if we do not achieve required targets under certain programs as estimated  it could have a material effect on our results of operations 
business combinations 
we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  management makes significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide credit in the normal course of business to our customers and are exposed to losses resulting from nonpayment or delinquent payment by customers 
we perform initial and ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for estimated credit losses 
we measure our performance in collecting customer accounts receivable in terms of days sales outstanding dso 
accounts receivable from continuing operations at december   were million  and consolidated dso at december   was  based on three months sales 
a hypothetical increase decrease in dso of one day would result in a decrease increase in our cash balances  an increase decrease in borrowings against our revolving credit facility  or a combination thereof of approximately million 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to our revolving credit facility 
we had no outstanding borrowings and million in letters of credit under the facility at december  a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would result in a potential reduction in future pre tax earnings of approximately million per year for every million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
due to the nature and pricing of our domestic segment distribution services  we are exposed to potential volatility in fuel prices 
our strategies for helping to mitigate our exposure to changing domestic fuel prices has included entering into leases for trucks with improved fuel efficiency and entering into fixed price agreements for diesel fuel 
we benchmark our domestic diesel fuel purchase prices against the us weekly retail on highway diesel prices benchmark as quoted by the us energy information administration 
the benchmark averaged per gallon in  increased from per gallon in based on our fuel consumption in  we estimate that every cents per gallon increase in the benchmark reduced our domestic segment operating earnings by approximately  in january  we entered into a fixed price purchase agreement with one of our diesel fuel suppliers for approximately one third of our anticipated domestic segment fuel usage for at an equivalent benchmark price of per gallon 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency translation and transaction risks 
our business transactions outside of the united states are primarily denominated in the euro and british pound 
we may use foreign currency forwards  swaps and options  where possible  to manage our risk related to certain foreign currency fluctuations 
however  we believe that our foreign currency transaction risks are low since our revenues and expenses are typically denominated in the same currency
