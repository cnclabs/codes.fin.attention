table of contents results of operations overview during  attractive housing affordability levels  historically low interest rates and higher rental rates have led to changes in buyer perceptions 
these factors  combined with moderate declines in the number of distressed properties and national housing inventory  have led to increased demand in most of the company markets

table of contents critical accounting policies preparation of the company consolidated financial statements requires the use of judgment in the application of accounting policies and estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
listed below are those policies that management believes are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
there are items within the financial statements that require estimation  but they are not considered critical 
management has discussed the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of its board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure 
use of estimates in budgeting land acquisitions  development and homebuilding construction costs associated with real estate projects  the company evaluates market conditions  material and labor costs  buyer preferences  construction timing  and provisions for insurance  mortgage loan reserves and warranty obligations 
the company accrues its best estimate of probable cost for the resolution of legal claims 
estimates  which are based on historical experience and other assumptions  are reviewed continually  updated when necessary and believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes that the timing and scope of its evaluation procedures are proper and adequate 
changes in assumptions relating to such factors  however  could have a material effect on the company results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period 
income recognition as required by asc no 
asc  real estate retail land  revenues and cost of sales are recorded at the time each home or lot is closed  title and possession are transferred to the buyer  and there is no significant continuing involvement from the company 
in order to match revenues with related expenses  land  land development  interest  taxes and other related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred in the future are allocated to the cost of homes closed  based upon the relative sales value basis of the total number of homes to be constructed in each community  in accordance with asc no 
asc  real estate general 
estimated land  common area development and related costs of planned communities  including the cost of amenities  are allocated to individual parcels or communities on a relative sales value basis 
changes to estimated costs  subsequent to the commencement of the delivery of homes  are allocated to the remaining undelivered homes in the community 
home construction and related costs are charged to the cost of homes closed under the specific identification method 
marketable securities in  the company began to invest a portion of its available cash and cash equivalent balances in marketable securities having maturities in excess of three months in a managed portfolio 
these investments are primarily held in the custody of a single financial institution 
to be considered for investment  securities must meet certain minimum requirements as to their credit ratings  maturity terms and other risk related criteria as defined by the company investment policies 
the primary objectives of these investments are the preservation of capital and the maintenance of a high degree of liquidity  with a secondary objective being the attainment of yields higher than those earned on the company cash and cash equivalent balances 
the company considers its investment portfolio to be available for sale 
accordingly  these investments are recorded at their fair values  with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income within the consolidated balance sheets 
see note f  fair values of financial and nonfinancial instruments 
the company periodically reviews its available for sale securities for other than temporary declines in fair values that are below their cost basis  as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
this evaluation is based on factors such as the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the security cost basis and the adverse conditions specifically related to the security  including any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency 
a temporary impairment results in an unrealized loss being recorded in accumulated 
table of contents other comprehensive income in stockholders equity within the consolidated balance sheets 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statements of earnings 
since the portfolio inception  none of the unrealized losses associated with the company marketable securities  available for sale  have been determined to be other than temporary 
the company believes that the cost bases for its marketable securities  available for sale  were recoverable in all material respects at december  and inventory valuation housing inventories consist principally of homes under construction  land under development and improved lots  and inventory held for sale 
inventory includes land and development costs  direct construction costs  capitalized indirect construction costs  capitalized interest  and real estate taxes 
the costs of acquiring and developing land and constructing certain related amenities are allocated to the parcels to which these costs relate 
interest and taxes are capitalized during active development and construction stages 
inventories to be held and used are stated at cost unless a community is determined to be impaired  in which case the impaired inventories are written down to their fair values 
inventories held for sale are stated at the lower of their costs or fair values  less cost to sell 
as required by asc  inventory is reviewed for potential write downs on an ongoing basis 
asc requires that  in the event that impairment indicators are present and undiscounted cash flows signify that the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable  impairment charges must be recorded if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
the company reviews all communities on a quarterly basis for changes in events or circumstances indicating signs of impairment 
examples of events or changes in circumstances include  but are not limited to price declines resulting from sustained competitive pressures  a change in the manner in which the asset is being used  a change in assessments by a regulator or municipality  cost increases  the expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life  or the impact of local economic or macroeconomic conditions  such as employment or housing supply  on the market for a given product 
signs of impairment may include  but are not limited to very low or negative profit margins  the absence of sales activity in an open community and or significant price differences for comparable parcels of land held for sale 
if it is determined that indicators of impairment exist in a community  undiscounted cash flows are prepared and analyzed at a community level based on expected pricing  sales rates  construction costs  local municipality fees  and warranty  closing  carrying  selling  overhead and other related costs  or on similar assets to determine if the realizable values of the assets held are less than their respective carrying amounts 
in order to determine assumed sales prices included in cash flow models  the company analyzes historical sales prices on homes delivered in the community and in other communities located within the same geographic area  as well as sales prices included in its current backlog for such communities 
in addition  it analyzes market studies and trends  which generally include statistics on sales prices in neighboring communities and sales prices of similar products in non neighboring communities in the same geographic area 
in order to estimate the costs of building and delivering homes  the company generally assumes cost structures reflecting contracts currently in place with vendors  adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases 
the company analysis of each community generally assumes current pricing equal to current sales orders for a particular or comparable community 
for a minority of communities that the company does not intend to operate for an extended period of time or where the operating life extends beyond several years  slight increases over current sales prices are assumed in later years 
once a community is considered to be impaired  the company determinations of fair value and new cost basis are primarily based on discounting estimated cash flows at rates commensurate with inherent risks associated with the continuing assets 
discount rates used generally vary from percent to percent  depending on market risk  the size or life of a community and development risk 
due to the fact that estimates and assumptions included in cash flow models are based on historical results and projected trends  unexpected changes in market conditions that may lead to additional impairment charges in the future cannot be anticipated 
valuation adjustments are recorded against homes completed or under construction  land under development or improved lots when analyses indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values 
write downs of impaired inventories to their fair values are recorded as adjustments to the cost 
table of contents basis of the respective inventory 
at december  and  valuation reserves related to impaired inventories totaled million and million  respectively 
the net carrying values of the related inventories totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the costs of acquiring and developing land and constructing certain related amenities are allocated to the parcels to which these costs relate 
management believes its processes are designed to properly assess the market and the carrying values of assets 
warranty reserves the company homes are sold with limited third party warranties 
warranty reserves are established as homes close on a house by house basis and in an amount estimated to adequately cover the expected costs of materials and outside labor during warranty periods 
certain factors are considered in determining the reserves  including the historical range of amounts paid per house  experience with respect to similar home designs and geographic areas  the historical amount paid as a percentage of home construction costs  any warranty expenditures not considered to be normal and recurring  and conditions that may affect certain subdivisions 
improvements in quality control and construction techniques expected to impact future warranty expenditures are also considered 
accordingly  the process of determining the company warranty reserves balance requires estimates associated with various assumptions  each of which can positively or negatively impact this balance 
generally  warranty reserves are reviewed monthly to determine the reasonableness and adequacy of both the aggregate reserve amount and the per unit reserve amount originally included in housing cost of sales  as well as to note the timing of any reversals of the original reserve 
general warranty reserves not utilized for a particular house are evaluated for reasonableness in the aggregate on both a market by market basis and a consolidated basis 
warranty payments for an individual house may exceed the related reserve 
payments in excess of the related reserve are evaluated in the aggregate to determine if an adjustment to the warranty reserve should be recorded  which could result in a corresponding adjustment to housing cost of sales 
the company continues to evaluate the adequacy of its warranty reserves and believes that its existing estimation process is materially accurate 
since the company warranty reserves can be impacted by a significant number of factors  it is possible that changes to the company assumptions could have a material impact on its warranty reserve balance 
income taxes the company calculates a provision for its income taxes by using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by identifying temporary differences arising from the diverse treatment of items for tax and general accounting purposes 
the company evaluates its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required 
in accordance with asc no 
asc  income taxes  the company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established based on available evidence indicating whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
the realization of a deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under tax law 
this assessment considers  among other matters  current and cumulative income and loss  future profitability  the duration of statutory carryback or carryforward periods  asset turns  and tax planning alternatives 
the company bases its estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates 
in certain cases  it also bases this estimate on business plan forecasts and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect the company actual tax results  and future business results may affect the amount of its deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of its deferred tax assets over time 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  particularly with respect to changes in facts and circumstances in future reporting periods  as well as to the residential homebuilding industry cyclicality and sensitivity to changes in economic conditions  it is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates used in the company historical analyses 
these differences could have a material impact on the company consolidated results of operations or financial position 

table of contents the company recorded significant deferred tax assets in  and these deferred tax assets were generated primarily by inventory impairments and by the company inability to carry back its  and net operating losses 
the company believes that the inability to carry back its current net operating losses and its recent earnings history are significant evidence of the need for a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
at december   the company had a valuation allowance equal to percent of its net deferred tax assets 
the company is allowed to carry forward tax losses for years and to apply such tax losses to future taxable income in order to realize federal deferred tax assets 
to the extent that the company generates sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize the tax benefits of related deferred tax assets  it expects to experience a reduction in its effective tax rate as the valuation allowance is reversed 
mortgage loan loss reserves reserves are created to address repurchase and indemnity claims by third party investors or purchasers that arise primarily if the borrower obtained the loan through fraudulent information or omissions  if there are origination deficiencies attributable to rmc  or if the borrower does not make a first payment 
reserves are determined based on pending claims received that are associated with previously sold mortgage loans  industry foreclosure data  the company portfolio delinquency and foreclosure rates on sold loans made available by investors  as well as on historical loss payment patterns used to develop ultimate loss projections 
estimating loss is difficult due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting foreclosure activity  as well as to delays in processing and requests for payment related to the loan loss by agencies and financial institutions 
recorded reserves represent the company best estimates of current and future unpaid losses as of december   based on existing conditions and available information 
the company continues to evaluate the adequacy of its mortgage loan loss reserves and believes that its existing estimation process provides a reasonable estimate of loss 
since the company mortgage loan loss reserves can be impacted by a significant number of factors  it is possible that subsequent changes in conditions or available information may change assumptions and estimates  which could have a material impact on its mortgage loan loss reserve balance 
share based payments the company follows the provisions of asc no 
asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires that compensation expense be measured and recognized at an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted under compensation arrangements 
the company calculates the fair value of stock options by using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
determination of the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions and involves a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to expected price volatility of the stock over the term of the awards  expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior 
additionally  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to forfeit 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and the company consolidated results of operations could be materially impacted 
the company believes that accounting for stock based compensation is a critical accounting policy because it requires the use of complex judgment in its application 
outlook during  improving economic conditions  historically high affordability levels for new homes  low interest rates  a reduced supply of new homes  and a more favorable product mix have led to a shift in housing fundamentals in most markets  which has resulted in increased demand and improved sales traffic through the company communities 
on average  sales rates  prices and margins have improved 
absent any unexpected changes in economic conditions  and other unforeseen circumstances  these developments  combined with reductions in relative overhead expenditures  should allow the company to continue to improve its performance 
the company increased its number of active communities by percent during the year ended december   and it anticipates continued growth in its community count in sales orders for new homes rose percent during  compared to at december   the company backlog of orders for new homes totaled  units  or a projected dollar value of million  reflecting a percent increase in projected dollar value from million at december  these trends seem to indicate that demand for new housing is improving  although high unemployment levels and tight mortgage credit standards continue to negatively 
table of contents impact the homebuilding industry by keeping sales absorption rates per community depressed  compared to traditional levels 
the pace at which the company acquires new land and opens additional communities will depend on market and economic conditions  as well as future sales rates 
although the company outlook remains cautious  the strength of its balance sheet  additional liquidity and improved operating leverage have positioned it to successfully take advantage of any continued improvements in economic trends and in the demand for new homes
