our retirement benefit plans  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  require us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
our plan obligations totaled million as of december  contributions to the various plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the market performance of plan assets  if any  and future changes in interest rates  which impact the actuarial measurement of plan obligations 
as a result  we have only included our expected contribution in the contractual obligations table 
the unfunded deferred compensation arrangements covering certain current and retired management employees totaled million as of december  our estimated distributions in the contractual obligations table are based upon a number of assumptions including termination dates and participant distribution elections 
operating lease commitments consist primarily of office and warehouse facilities  vehicles and office equipment as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include all known open purchase orders  contractual purchase commitments and contractual obligations as of december  other obligations include collateralized borrowings as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements and residual value guarantees as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents total contractual obligations exclude our gross unrecognized tax benefits of million and accrued interest and penalties of million as of december  we expect to make cash outlays in the future related to uncertain tax positions 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
newly issued accounting guidance offsetting assets and liabilities disclosures in december  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance on disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
this update adds certain additional disclosure requirements about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to netting arrangements 
the new disclosures are required for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after january  we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
testing intangibles for impairment in july  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance on the periodic testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this updated accounting guidance permits us to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if we determine through this qualitative analysis that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  it is not necessary to calculate annually the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset 
this guidance is effective for fiscal periods beginning after september   however  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect this guidance to have an impact on our results of operations or financial position as we do not currently hold any indefinite lived intangible assets 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record a reserve for accounts receivable that are potentially uncollectible 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to trade receivables 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to these customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience 
bad debt write offs as a percentage of net sales were approximately in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved against accounts receivable for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserves we value our inventory at the lower of the cost of inventory or fair market value through the establishment of a reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
reserve requirements are developed by comparing our inventory levels to our projected demand requirements based on historical demand  market conditions and technological and product life cycle changes 
it is possible that an increase in our reserve may be required in the future if there are significant declines in demand for certain products 
this reserve creates a new cost basis for these products and is considered permanent 
as of december   we had million reserved against inventories 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired and is allocated to our reporting units at the time of the acquisition 
we analyze goodwill on an annual basis and when an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of one of our reporting units below its carrying amount 
a goodwill impairment loss occurs if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we performed an analysis of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the two step model is used as an indicator to identify if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the first step indicates there may be an impairment  the second step is performed which measures the amount of the goodwill impairment  if any 
we perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of year end and use our judgment to develop assumptions for the discounted cash flow model that we use  if necessary 
management assumptions include forecasting revenues and margins  estimating capital expenditures  depreciation  amortization and discount rates 

table of contents if our goodwill impairment testing resulted in one or more of our reporting units carrying amount exceeding its fair value  we would write down our reporting units carrying amount to its fair value and would record an impairment charge in our results of operations in the period such determination is made 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment charges is not permitted 
each of our reporting units were analyzed for impairment as of december  and based upon our analysis  the estimated fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts 
we had goodwill of million as of december  warranty reserves we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to net sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim  new product introductions and other factors 
future claims experience could be materially different from prior results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  or manufacturing changes that could impact product quality 
in the event we determine that our current or future product repair and replacement costs exceed our estimates  an adjustment to these reserves would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved for future estimated warranty costs 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions 
we also establish reserves for uncertain tax matters that are complex in nature and uncertain as to the ultimate outcome 
although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we consider our ability to ultimately prevail in defending these matters when establishing these reserves 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
we believe that our current reserves are adequate 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates and assumptions and could impact the income tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns  and some differences will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on property  plant and equipment 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years but have already been recorded as an expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  based on management s judgment  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation reserve against those deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance could be materially different from actual results because of changes in the mix of future taxable income  the relationship between book and taxable income and our tax planning strategies 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million was recorded against foreign tax loss carry forwards and state credit carry forwards 
cautionary factors relevant to forward looking information this annual report on form k  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item  contain certain statements that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  intend  estimate  anticipate  believe  project  or continue or similar words or the negative thereof 
these statements do not relate to strictly historical or current facts and provide current expectations of forecasts of future events 
any such expectations or forecasts of future events are subject to a variety of factors 
particular risks and uncertainties presently facing us include geopolitical and economic uncertainty throughout the world 
competition in our business 
ability to effectively manage organizational changes 
ability to comply with laws and regulations 
ability to attract and retain key personnel 
ability to develop and fund new innovative products and services 
unforeseen product liability claims or product quality issues 
ability to successfully upgrade and evolve the capabilities of our computer systems 
ability to effectively maintain and manage the data in our computer systems 
occurrence of a significant business interruption 
relative strength of the us dollar  which affects the cost of our materials and products purchased and sold internationally 
ability to acquire  retain and protect proprietary intellectual property rights 
fluctuations in the cost or availability of raw materials and purchased components 
we caution that forward looking statements must be considered carefully and that actual results may differ in material ways due to risks and uncertainties both known and unknown 
information about factors that could materially affect our results can be found in part i  item a risk factors 
shareholders  potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating forward looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
investors are advised to consult any further disclosures by us in our filings with the securities and exchange commission and in other written statements on related subjects 
it is not possible to anticipate or foresee all risk factors  and investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive or complete list of all risks or uncertainties 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk we are subject to exposures resulting from potential cost increases related to our purchase of raw materials or other product components 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to manage our exposures to changes in commodity prices such as steel  oil  gas  lead and other commodities 
various factors beyond our control affect the price of oil and gas  including but not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  domestic and foreign governmental regulation  weather related factors and the overall economic environment 
we purchase petroleum related component parts for use in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  our freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales and service vehicle fuel costs are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas 
increases in worldwide demand and other factors affect the price for lead  steel and related products 
we do not maintain an inventory of raw or fabricated steel or batteries in excess of near term production requirements 
as a result  increases in the price of lead or steel can significantly increase the cost of our lead and steel based raw materials and component parts 
during the first part of  our raw materials and other purchased component costs were unfavorably impacted by commodity prices although we were able to somewhat mitigate these higher costs with pricing actions and cost reduction activities 
we continue to focus on mitigating the risk of continued future raw material or other product component cost increases through product pricing  negotiations with our vendors and cost reduction actions 
the success of these efforts will depend upon our ability to increase our selling prices in a competitive market and our ability to achieve cost savings 
if the commodity prices increase significantly and we are not able to offset the increases with higher selling prices  our results may be unfavorably impacted in foreign currency exchange risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to exposures resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business 
our primary exchange rate exposures are with the euro  australian and canadian dollars  british pound  japanese yen  chinese yuan and brazilian real against the us dollar 
the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies to us dollars  the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between tennant operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses 
in addition to the direct financial impact  foreign currency exchange has an indirect financial impact on our results  including the effect on sales volume within local economies and the impact of pricing actions taken as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
because a substantial portion of our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger us dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize the earnings effects associated with foreign exchange rate changes on certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we periodically enter into various contracts  principally forward exchange contracts  to protect the value of certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on these contracts generally approximate changes in the value of the related assets and liabilities 
we had forward exchange contracts outstanding in the notional amounts of million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the potential for material loss in fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding and the related underlying exposures as of december   from a adverse change is unlikely due to the short term nature of our forward contracts 
our policy prohibits us from entering into transactions for speculative purposes 
other matters management regularly reviews our business operations with the objective of improving financial performance and maximizing our return on investment 
as a result of this ongoing process to improve financial performance  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future which  if taken  could be material to our financial results
