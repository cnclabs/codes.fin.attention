item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in thousands  except per share amounts 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial and statistical information appearing elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents overview we are one of the largest global organizations devoted to the rental  lease and sale of new and used electronic t m equipment 
we purchase that equipment from leading manufacturers such as agilent technologies  inc agilent and tektronix inc 
primarily for use by our customers in the aerospace  defense  telecommunications  electronics  industrial and semiconductor industries 
in addition  although it represented only approximately  and of our revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  we believe our data products dp division is one of the largest rental businesses in the united states for personal computers and servers from manufacturers including dell  h p compaq  ibm  toshiba and apple 
in fiscal  we became a reseller for agilent  the largest t m equipment manufacturer in north america  which provides us with the exclusive right to sell agilent s more complex t m equipment to small and medium size customers who previously purchased directly from agilent in the united states and canada through january  we do not currently have reseller agreements with any other manufacturers for equipment similar to that included in our agilent reseller agreement 
in addition  we sell used equipment from a variety of manufacturers that was previously in our rental and lease pool 
we have a focused sales strategy  using a direct sales force to meet our customers needs in our t m equipment rental  lease and sales business 
we have a large technical sales force that consists primarily of field engineers and applications engineers  each of whom specializes in all the products and services offered by our company 
our sales force is usually assigned to specific territories  and identifies potential customers through coordinated efforts with our marketing organization 
our marketing organization is staffed by professionals with many years of industry related experience 
as our customers have a wide range of requirements for equipment  our sales force is able to leverage our extensive knowledge of the test and measurement equipment environment to determine the right product to rent  lease or sell to the customer to meet the customer s specific needs 
our sales force also specializes in configuring new agilent equipment to sell to our customers that is tailored to the customer s need 
these configurations typically start with a base model  which is frequently upgraded through an extensive list of options in order to perform the customer s specific test or measurement 
once the configuration is determined  it serves as the basis for our orders to agilent  who builds the product accordingly 
we order equipment from agilent once the customer has placed an order with us 
equipment is typically shipped directly to the customer by agilent at our request 
occasionally  equipment is shipped to our warehouse prior to delivery to the customer 
inventory held for sale is immaterial and is therefore included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
each order and sales invoice is subject to our standard sales terms and conditions  which include provisions covering equipment delivery delays and warranty services 
on march   we completed the acquisition of certain assets including accounts receivable and rental equipment but excluding certain designated assets and select liabilities of telogy for million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments 
the purchase price was reduced by million in fiscal reflecting the final determination of assets acquired and other components of the purchase price in accordance with specific provisions of the asset purchase agreement with telogy 
telogy  headquartered in union city  california  was a leading provider of electronic t m equipment in north america 
on august   we completed the acquisition of certain assets including accounts receivable and rental equipment but excluding certain designated assets and the assumption of specified post closing liabilities of emt  for million in cash  of which million was deposited into an escrow account for any post closing adjustments 
the purchase price was reduced by million reflecting the final determination of the post closing adjustment of the purchase price in accordance with the asset purchase agreement with emt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
in recent years  our financial results were impacted by competitive pressure on rental rates due in large part to the recession in the us and our major international markets 
during fiscal through  we experienced a modest improvement in our t m and dp rental rates and a significant increase in our equipment on rent  in part due to our acquisition of emt at the end of the first quarter of fiscal  while maintaining a high utilization rate  in particular in our north american and european operations 
in addition  our rental revenues have benefited from our expanded sales force and integration and cross training of our resale organization and t m sales force 
as a result of these continued improvements  and sales of t m equipment in connection with our resale channel  we experienced strong growth in revenues for fiscal during fiscal  our operating profit modestly declined reflecting our 
table of contents significant investment in broadening and strengthening our sales and sales support organizations  as well as our administrative infrastructure  necessary to support our increased sales and rental demand and to better focus on future growth opportunities 
during fiscal  our revenues were flat compared to fiscal  as rental and lease growth and increased sales of used equipment  in part due to a large buyout of used equipment by a customer in the third fiscal quarter of  were offset by a decline in sales of new equipment 
our new equipment sales were affected by changes in the us national budgetary policy and continuing uncertainty in the economy  including the telecommunications and national defense sectors  causing delays in our customers procurement decisions 
as a result  many customers have chosen to rent equipment or delay all significant procurement decisions as they contemplate how to operate going forward 
our operating profit modestly increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal  as growth in our higher margin rental and lease revenues and used equipment sales offset declines in our sales of new equipment  which have lower operating margins 
we experienced an increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of our infrastructure investment which began in fiscal and continued throughout fiscal and in support of our expanded sales opportunities for new and used equipment  as well as growth in our rental and lease business 
economic uncertainty continues to impact our customers and competitors  resulting in more stringent credit requirements and reduced access to capital 
we will continue to focus on remaining profitable in the current conditions  as well as being prepared for the possibility that recessionary trends may return in future periods 
to maximize our overall profit from the rental  leasing  and sales of equipment  we manage our equipment pool on an on going basis by controlling the timing  pricing and mix of our purchases and sales of equipment 
we acquire new and used equipment to meet current technological standards and current and anticipated customer demand  and we sell our used equipment where we believe that is the most lucrative option 
we employ a complex equipment management strategy and our proprietary perfect software to adjust our inventory and pricing on a dynamic basis in order to maximize equipment availability  utilization and profitability 
we manage each specific equipment class based on a separate assessment of that equipment s historical and projected life cycle and numerous other factors  including the us and global economy  interest rates and new product launches 
if we do not accurately predict market trends  or if demand for the equipment we supply declines  we can be left with inventory that we are unable to rent or sell for a profit 
we assess the carrying value of the equipment pool on a quarterly basis or more frequently when factors indicating potential impairment are present 
profitability and key business trends comparing fiscal to fiscal  our revenues increased by from million to million  our operating profit increased from million to million and our net income decreased by from million to million 
our net income for fiscal included a bargain purchase gain  net of deferred taxes  of million  as a result of our acquisition of emt 
our rental and lease revenues increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal for fiscal and  of our rental and lease revenues were derived from t m equipment 
our t m rental revenues increased million due to an increase in rental demand  in particular in our north american and european operations  and the integration of our resale organization and t m sales force 
our rental revenues also include a million increase related to the equipment acquired from emt in late august our t m lease revenues increased approximately million  which was primarily attributed to an increase in demand for equipment leases 
the impact of the changes in t m rental and lease rates on rental and lease revenues was insignificant 
rental revenues in our dp segment declined million  due to a decrease of million relating to lower demand  offsetting an increase of million due to higher rental rates 
our dp lease revenues were relatively unchanged 
our sales of equipment and other revenues decreased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decline in new equipment sales of million as our customers that traditionally purchase new equipment delayed procurement decisions in response to changes in our us national budgetary policy and uncertainty in the global economy  which more than offset higher used equipment sales of million  that reflected a large buyout by a customer in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal and our increased sales and marketing efforts in this area 

table of contents some of our key profitability measurements are presented below fiscal fiscal fiscal net income per diluted common share eps net income as a percentage of average assets net income as a percentage of average equity our net income for fiscal included a bargain purchase gain  net of deferred taxes  of million as a result of our acquisition of emt 
for fiscal  our operating profit increased  or million  compared to fiscal our rental and lease business contributed an additional million in operating profit  including million in connection with the equipment acquired from emt  resulting from a a million increase in rental and lease revenues  b an offsetting increase in depreciation expense of million  or  due to a higher average rental equipment pool  and c an offsetting increase in our costs of rentals and leases  excluding depreciation  of million  or 
sales of equipment and other revenues decreased million  or  but contributed an additional million in operating profit  as a decline in our lower margin new equipment sales was offset by an increase in our higher margin used equipment sales  and other revenues slightly increased 
although our higher margin used equipment sales contributed an additional million in operating profit  this was offset by a million decline in operating profit from sales of our lower margin new equipment 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the broadening and strengthening of our sales organization in support of our new and used equipment sales  higher rental demand  and future growth opportunities 
we have revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities in foreign currencies  primarily euros  canadian dollar and chinese yuan  due to our foreign operations 
we enter into forward contracts to hedge against unfavorable currency fluctuations in our monetary assets and liabilities in our european and canadian operations  and our exposure to fluctuations in the chinese yuan is not significant 
these contracts are designed to minimize the effect of fluctuations in foreign currencies 
as a result of these forward contracts  as well as the relative stability of these foreign currencies  the impact on our operating results as a result of foreign currency fluctuations has been insignificant 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in foreign currencies for additional information about our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
the average amount of our equipment on rent  based on acquisition cost  increased to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the average acquisition cost of equipment on lease increased to million for fiscal compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in our average equipment on rent and lease is primarily attributable to a growth in our t m business  which was due  in part  to the acquisition of emt in fiscal  as well as strengthening demand in our worldwide operations and the expansion of our sales force and integration and cross training of our resale organization and t m sales force  resulting in increased opportunities 
average rental rates for our t m and dp segments decreased by for fiscal compared to fiscal  but increased compared to fiscal our average lease rates decreased by for fiscal compared to fiscal  and compared to fiscal average utilization for our t m equipment pool  calculated based on average acquisition cost of equipment on rent and lease compared to the average total equipment pool  decreased to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the average utilization of our dp equipment pool  based on the same method of calculation  decreased to for fiscal  compared to and for fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in lease rates is the result of competitive pressures 
our utilization rate fluctuates frequently  and is impacted by new equipment purchases in support of existing and potential business  and sales of used equipment 
as of may  and may   our sales order backlog for t m equipment relating to our resale channel was million and million  respectively 
the decline in backlog for fiscal is primarily due to shorter manufacturing lead time and a reduction in new sales orders  reflecting lower demand 
results of operations reclassification the previously reported statement of operations line item captioned costs of revenues other than depreciation of rental and lease equipment has been changed to separately present costs of rentals and leases  excluding depreciation and costs of sales of equipment and other revenues to comply with the applicable income statement disclosure requirements for public companies 
further  in order to more 
table of contents closely align activity related to our rental and lease operations  including revenues and the expenses associated with providing those revenues  we have reclassified certain expenses previously included in selling  general and administrative expenses to costs of rentals and leases  excluding depreciation  which resulted in a reduction to previously reported selling  general and administrative expenses of million and million  respectively  for fiscal and  respectively 
see note to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further discussion 
fiscal compared with fiscal total revenues total revenues for fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in total revenues was due to a increase in rental and lease revenues offset by a decrease in sales of equipment and other revenues 
rental and lease revenues for fiscal were million  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase is due to an increase in t m rental and lease demand  in particular in our north american operations  due in part to the acquisition of emt  and the integration of our resale organization and t m sales force  which began in the first quarter of fiscal  providing additional rental opportunities to an expanding customer base  and higher demand from our customers in lieu of new equipment purchases 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in rental and lease revenues in our dp business  due to a decrease in demand 
sales of equipment and other revenues decreased to million for fiscal from million in the prior year 
sales of used equipment  including finance leases  increased to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  in part due to a large buyout by a customer in the third quarter of fiscal  while sales of new equipment decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  as our customers that traditionally purchase new equipment delayed procurement decisions due to changes in the us national budgetary policy and uncertainty in the global economy 
operating expenses depreciation of rental and lease equipment depreciation of rental and lease equipment increased in fiscal to million  or of rental and lease revenues  from million  or of rental and lease revenues  in fiscal the increased depreciation expense in fiscal was due to a higher average rental and lease equipment pool 
the depreciation ratio  as a percentage of rental and lease revenues  marginally increased due to a moderate decline in utilization rates while rental rates were flat 
costs of rentals and leases  excluding depreciation costs of rentals and leases  excluding depreciation  which primarily includes labor related costs of our operations personnel  supplies  repairs  and insurance and warehousing costs associated with our rental and lease equipment  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to higher labor related costs to support growth in our rental and lease business 
this expense is not expected to significantly fluctuate from period to period  as only moderate changes are required from time to time to handle changes in rental and lease activity 
costs of sales of equipment and other revenues costs of sales of equipment and other revenues  which primarily includes the cost of equipment sales  decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal costs of sales of equipment and other revenues decreased as a percentage of sales of equipment and other revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease is due to a decline in sales of new t m equipment  which generally carry a lower margin than used equipment sales  while higher margin used equipment sales increased 
our sales margin percentage is expected to fluctuate depending on the mix of used and new equipment sales 
our sales margin is also impacted by competition  economic uncertainty  changes in us governmental policies  and customer requirements and funding 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased modestly to in fiscal from in fiscal our selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the broadening and strengthening of our sales and sales support organizations  as well as our administrative infrastructure  necessary to support our sales and rental demand and to better focus on future growth opportunities 

table of contents gain on bargain purchase we recorded a gain on bargain purchase  net of deferred taxes  of million during fiscal related to our acquisition of emt 
the gain on bargain purchase  net of deferred taxes  resulted from the excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the emt acquisition  over the respective purchase price 
we believe that we were able to negotiate a bargain purchase price as a result of our access to the liquidity necessary to complete the transaction  and the recurring losses and bankruptcy filing of emt 
income tax provision our effective tax rate was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the increase for fiscal is due to a bargain purchase gain  net of deferred taxes  of million for fiscal  related to our purchase of emt on august  bargain purchase gains are recorded net of deferred taxes and are treated as permanent differences  resulting in a lower effective tax rate in the period recorded 
fiscal compared with fiscal total revenues total revenues for fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in total revenues was due to a increase in rental and lease revenues and a increase in sales of equipment and other revenues 
rental and lease revenues for fiscal were million  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase reflects the emt acquisition in august and an increase in t m rental demand and rental rates in our north american and european operations  due to improved market conditions and the integration of our new resale organization and existing t m sales force  providing additional rental opportunities to an expanding customer base 
this increase was offset by a decline in lease revenues in our dp business  due to a decrease in demand 
sales of equipment and other revenues increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal sales of used equipment  including finance leases  decreased to million for fiscal  compared to million for the prior year period  while sales of new equipment increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due to an increase in our sales of new t m equipment through our resale channel  as we continued to grow and expand both our customer base and our sales infrastructure in connection with our agilent resale agreement depreciation of rental and lease equipment depreciation of rental and lease equipment increased in fiscal to million  or of rental and lease revenues  from million  or of rental and lease revenues  in fiscal the increased depreciation expense in fiscal was due to a higher average rental and lease equipment pool 
the depreciation ratio  as a percentage of rental and lease revenues  increased slightly as modest improvements in our average rental rates were more than offset by a decrease in our average utilization rates 
costs of rentals and leases  excluding depreciation costs of rentals and leases  excluding depreciation  which primarily includes labor related costs of our operations personnel  supplies  repairs  and insurance and warehousing costs associated with our rental and lease equipment  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to higher labor related costs 
this expense is not expected to significantly fluctuate from period to period  as only moderate changes are required from time to time to handle changes in rental and lease activity 
costs of sales of equipment and other revenues costs of sales of equipment and other revenues  which primarily include the cost of equipment sales  increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal costs of sales of equipment and other revenues increased as a percentage of sales of equipment and other revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase is due to a decrease in used equipment sales and an increase in sales of new t m equipment  which generally carry a lower margin than used equipment sales 
our sales margin percentage is expected to fluctuate depending on the mix of used and new equipment sales 
our sales margin is also impacted by competition  the global recession  and customer requirements and funding 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal our selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the broadening and strengthening of our sales organization in support of our resale channel and higher rental demand 
gain on bargain purchase we recorded gain on bargain purchase  net of deferred taxes  of million during fiscal related to our acquisition of emt and million during fiscal related to our acquisition of telogy  llc telogy  a private company headquartered in union city  california  and a leading provider of electronic t m equipment  in march the gain on bargain purchase  net of deferred taxes  resulted from the excess of the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the emt and telogy acquisitions  respectively  over the respective purchase prices 
a 
table of contents majority of the telogy bargain purchase gain was recorded in fiscal  the year of acquisition 
we believe that we were able to negotiate bargain purchase prices as a result of our access to the liquidity necessary to complete the transactions  and the recurring losses and bankruptcy filings of both emt and telogy 
income tax provision our effective tax rate was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal includes our bargain purchase gain  net of deferred taxes  of million compared to million for the prior year period  resulting from of our purchase of emt on august  bargain purchase gains are recorded net of deferred taxes and are treated as permanent differences  resulting in a lower effective tax rate in the period recorded 
our effective tax rate for fiscal includes the benefit from derecognition of million of interest and penalties resulting from the effective settlement of our uncertain tax positions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures 
our primary capital requirements have been purchases of rental and lease equipment 
we generally purchase equipment throughout the year to replace equipment that has been sold and to maintain adequate levels of rental equipment to meet existing and expected customer demands 
to meet t m rental demand  support areas of potential growth for both t m and dp equipment and to keep our equipment pool technologically up to date  we made payments for purchases of million of rental and lease equipment during fiscal  million in fiscal  excluding million  at fair value  of rental and lease equipment acquired in connection with our acquisition of emt in fiscal  and million in fiscal the decrease in equipment purchases of from fiscal to fiscal is due to a decline from the unusually high payment level of fiscal which reflected continued recovery from the economic downturn 
share repurchases and dividends 
we periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under an authorization from our board of directors 
shares we repurchase are retired and returned to the status of authorized but unissued stock 
there were no shares repurchased in fiscal  and we may make repurchases of our common stock in the future through open market transactions or otherwise  but we have no commitments to do so 
for fiscal  we paid dividends of per common share  including a special dividend of per common share  compared to per common share in fiscal and per common share in fiscal  respectively  amounting to an aggregate of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect to continue paying a quarterly dividend in future quarters  although the amount and timing of dividends  if any  will be made at the discretion of our board of directors in each quarter  subject to compliance with applicable law 
cash and cash equivalents and investments 
the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was million at may   an increase of million from may  outside our normal operations and equipment purchases  we use our cash to pay dividends to shareholders and to take advantage of strategic acquisitions and new customer opportunities 
since the beginning of fiscal we have returned million in cash to our shareholders  increasing our annual dividend rate from per common share to per common share in fiscal we have also made payments of million in connection with two acquisitions and invested heavily in new equipment to take advantage of key new customer opportunities 
on december   we used million of our cash and borrowed million against our credit facility with union bank to pay the quarterly dividend of per common share and the special dividend of per common share on december  we expect that the level of our cash needs may increase as we pay dividends in future quarters  or if we decide to buy back our common stock  increase equipment purchases in response to demand  finance another acquisition  or pursue other opportunities 
given our growth record achieved  with minimal debt since fiscal  and our available line of credit of which we have million remaining that we may borrow as of july   we believe that we have ample access to borrowing capacity and that our cash flow from operations and ability to borrow will allow us to continue funding our current and future growth 
we may seek to expand our borrowing capacity in order to ensure sufficient resources to quickly respond to strategic growth opportunities 
cash flows and credit facilities 
we have three principal sources of liquidity cash flows provided by our operating activities  proceeds from the sale of equipment from our portfolio  and external funds that historically have been provided by bank borrowings 

table of contents during fiscal   and net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
operating cash flow for fiscal was comparable to fiscal as an improvement in our working capital  and an increase in income after giving effect to non cash items  for fiscal  was offset by tax payments of million for fiscal  compared to a tax refund  net of taxes paid  of million for fiscal operating cash flow for fiscal was comparable to fiscal as an improvement in income  after giving effect to non cash items  was offset by a tax refund  net of taxes paid  of million for fiscal  and an increase in our demonstration inventory of million for fiscal during fiscal  and net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the decline in cash used in investing activities for fiscal was due  in part  to a decrease in payments for purchases of rental and lease equipment to million compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
there were no redemptions of trading investments in fiscal or  compared to redemptions of trading investments  of million for fiscal proceeds from sale of rental and lease equipment were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal fiscal includes cash paid for the acquisition of emt of million 
net cash flows used in financing activities were million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in these funds used were primarily composed of payments for dividends of million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal as the following table illustrates  aggregate cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from the sale of equipment have provided of the funds required for equipment purchased for the three years ended may   excluding equipment purchased in connection with acquisitions 
in thousands fiscal three years ended may  cash flows from operating activities proceeds from sale of equipment total payments for equipment purchases net increase in equipment portfolio at acquisition cost for the components of cash flows from operating activities see the consolidated statements of cash flows 
we have a million revolving bank line of credit  subject to certain restrictions  to meet equipment acquisition needs as well as working capital and general corporate requirements 
we borrowed million and repaid million on our line of credit during fiscal of the million borrowed  million was borrowed on december  to fund the quarterly and special dividend that we paid on december  as of may   we had million on borrowings outstanding under the revolving bank line of credit 
there are no other bank borrowings outstanding or off balance sheet financing arrangements at may  we are in compliance with all loan covenants at may  we believe that cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operating activities  proceeds from the sale of equipment and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
inflation 
inflation generally has favorably influenced our results of operations by enhancing the sale prices of our used equipment 
however  lower inflation rates and the continued availability of newer  less expensive equipment with similar or better specifications over a period of several years could result in lower relative sale prices for used electronic equipment  which could reduce margins and earnings 
prices of new and used electronic test equipment have not consistently followed the overall inflation rate  while prices of new and used personal computers and servers have consistently declined 
because we are unable to predict the advances in technology and the rate of inflation for the next several years  it is not possible to estimate the impact of these factors on our margins and earnings 
contractual obligations at may   our material contractual obligations consist of outstanding borrowings under our commercial credit agreement  which is a revolving line of credit and therefore there is no schedule of payments  expiring in november  and operating leases for facilities 

table of contents we lease certain facilities under various operating leases 
most of the lease agreements provide us with the option of renewing the lease at the end of the initial lease term  at the fair rental value  for periods of up to seven years 
in most cases  we expect that facility leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases in the normal course of business 
the table below presents the expected amount of payments due under our contractual obligations  as of may   but does not reflect changes that could arise after that time payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years commercial credit agreement facility lease payments  not including property taxes and insurance total 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on a regular basis  we review these estimates  including those related to asset lives and depreciation methods  impairment of long lived assets including rental and lease equipment  impairment of goodwill and definite lived intangible assets  revenue recognition and income taxes 
these estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies include the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements asset lives and depreciation methods our primary business involves the purchase and subsequent rental and lease of long lived electronic equipment 
we have chosen asset lives that we believe correspond to the economic lives of the related assets 
we have chosen depreciation methods that we believe generally match our benefit from the assets with the associated costs 
these judgments have been made based on our expertise in each equipment type that we carry 
if the asset life and depreciation method chosen do not reduce the book value of the asset to at least our potential future cash flows from the asset  we would be required to record an impairment loss 
depreciation methods and useful lives are periodically reviewed and revised as deemed appropriate 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our rental and lease equipment and finite lived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances have occurred  or our outlook for future market conditions would indicate the carrying amount is not fully recoverable 
this requires us to make estimates related to future cash flows from the assets and to determine whether any deterioration is other than temporary 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
there were no such impairment charges during fiscal  and goodwill impairment goodwill is the excess of the acquisition cost of a business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
we recognized goodwill of million on the acquisition of rush computer rentals in january impairment testing for goodwill is performed annually  on may  or more frequently if indications of potential impairment exist under the provisions of asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
the impairment test for goodwill uses a two step approach  which is performed at the reporting unit level 
we have separate operating segments reporting units for t m and dp equipment  although these two segments are aggregated into a single reportable segment in accordance with asc  segment reporting 
step one of the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit using a market approach to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  there is a potential impairment and step two must be performed 
step two compares the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its implied fair value ie  fair value of reporting unit less the fair value of the unit s assets and liabilities  including identifiable intangible assets 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill  impairment is recognized 
definite lived intangible assets definite lived intangible assets consist of customer relationships 
the assets are amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with asc if any indications of impairment are present  then we test for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset 
if the net undiscounted cash flows indicate the asset is not recoverable  we determine the fair value of the asset and record any impairment 
we reevaluate the useful life determinations for these intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision in their remaining useful lives 
revenue recognition principal agent considerations in accordance with accounting guidance  we are acting as the principal with respect to sales of new equipment through our resale agreement  based on several factors  including we act as the primary obligor by working directly with our customers to define their needs  providing them with options to satisfy such needs  contracting directly with the customer  and  to the extent required  providing customers with instruction on the use of the product and additional technical support once the product is received by the customer 
the product manufacturer is not a party to our customer sales agreements  nor is it referenced in the agreements  and therefore has 
table of contents no obligation to our customers with the exception of the manufacturer s standard warranty on the product 
we bear back end risk of inventory loss with respect to any product return from the customer as the original manufacturer is not required to accept returns of equipment from us 
we also bear front end risk of inventory loss in those cases where we acquire products for resale into our inventory prior to shipment to customers 
we have full discretion in setting pricing terms with our customers and to negotiate all such terms ourselves 
we assume all credit risk 
accordingly  sales of new equipment through our resale channel are recorded in sales of equipment and other revenues and the related equipment costs are recorded in costs of sales of equipment and other revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
this process involves us estimating actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered 
to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we determined that a valuation allowance was required in fiscal  and of million  million and million  respectively  for our deferred tax asset related to certain foreign net operating loss carry forwards and other related timing differences 
the guidance for uncertain income tax positions provides that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the more likely than not threshold represents a positive assertion by us that our company is entitled to the economic benefits of a tax position 
if a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits  no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
moreover  the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
during the second quarter of fiscal we effectively settled our remaining uncertain tax positions  and derecognized million of previously recognized uncertain tax positions  and the related deferred tax asset  and million for interest and penalties previously recognized 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
off balance sheet transactions as of may  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we could be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate and market risk 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on our commercial credit agreement with union bank  na which matures on november  the loan agreement bears interest at the reference rate minus or libor plus  and the weighted average interest rate at may  was 
our borrowings under on our commercial credit agreement at may  were million  and we have not previously had borrowings outstanding at any fiscal year end under this commercial credit agreement 
as our borrowings outstanding have not been significant  and the interest rate is low  a hypothetical increase in interest rates by would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of high quality securities  including direct obligations of the united states government  securities issued by agencies of the united states government and aaa rated money market or cash management funds 
our investments were not significant for fiscal and changes in foreign currencies 
we have wholly owned chinese and european subsidiaries 
in addition  we have revenues  cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable in other foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar 
our international operations subject us to foreign currency risks ie  the possibility that the financial results 
table of contents could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
during fiscal we began using forward contracts to hedge our economic exposure with respect to assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
although there can be no assurances  given the extent of our international operations and our hedging  we do not expect a change in foreign currency rates to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet
