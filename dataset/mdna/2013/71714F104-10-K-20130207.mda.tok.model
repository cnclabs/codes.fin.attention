the corporation has been informed that the government believes that the claims at issue were not eligible for payment due to the alleged non compliance with various medicare  medicaid and other laws and regulations relating to the dispensing  control  sale  billing and reimbursement for such controlled substances 
the corporation denies the allegations made by the government and will defend itself in the event any actions are brought by the government 
at this time  we are unable to estimate the outcome of the investigations 
if the government brings claims and the corporation is not successful in defending them  it could result in material fines and recoupment of government claims which could result in a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity

single source generic drugs  previously classified as brand drugs  are now being classified as generics for purposes of the generic dispensing rate calculation in all periods 

table of contents use of non gaap measures for measuring annual results the corporation calculates adjusted ebitda as provided in the reconciliation below and calculates adjusted ebitda margin by taking adjusted ebitda and dividing it by revenues 
the corporation calculates and uses adjusted ebitda as an indicator of its ability to generate cash from reported operating results 
the measurement is used in concert with net income and cash flows from operating activities  which measure actual cash generated in the period 
in addition  the corporation believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are supplemental measurement tools used by analysts and investors to help evaluate overall operating performance and the ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
in addition  adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is used in conjunction with the corporation s debt leverage ratio and this calculation sets the applicable margin for the quarterly interest charge 
adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is not the same calculation as this adjusted ebitda table 
adjusted ebitda does not represent funds available for the corporation s discretionary use and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operating activities data as measured under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the items excluded from adjusted ebitda but included in the calculation of the corporation s reported net income and cash flows from operating activities are significant components of the accompanying consolidated income statements and cash flows  and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance 
the corporation s calculation of adjusted ebitda may not be consistent with calculations of ebitda used by other companies 
the following are reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to the corporation s net income and net operating cash flows for the periods presented 
the corporation calculates and uses adjusted diluted earnings per share  which is exclusive of the impact of merger  acquisition  integration costs and other charges  hurricane sandy disaster costs  impairment of intangible assets  and tax accounting matters as an indicator of its core operating results 
the measurement is used in concert with net income and diluted earnings per share  which measure actual earnings per share generated in the period 
the corporation believes the exclusion of these charges in expressing earnings per share provides management with a useful measure to assess period to period comparability and is useful to investors in evaluating the corporation s operating results from period to period 
adjusted diluted earnings per share  which is exclusive of the impact of merger  acquisition  integration costs and other charges  hurricane sandy disaster costs  impairment of intangible assets  and tax accounting matters does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders ie  such costs are a reduction in earnings and stockholders equity and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for diluted earnings per share as measured under gaap

the corporation s business and industry trends the corporation is an institutional pharmacy services company that services healthcare facilities  provides pharmacy management services to hospitals and also provides specialty infusion services to patients outside a hospital setting 
the corporation is the second largest institutional pharmacy services company in the united states based on revenues and customer licensed beds under contract  operating institutional pharmacies and specialty infusion pharmacies in states 
the corporation s customers are typically institutional healthcare providers  such as skilled nursing facilities  nursing centers  assisted living facilities  hospitals  individuals receiving in home care and other long term alternative care settings 
the corporation is generally the primary source of supply of pharmaceuticals to its customers 
the corporation also provides pharmacy management services to hospitals in the united states 
the institutional pharmacy services business is highly competitive 
competition is a significant factor that can impact the corporation s overall financial results  pricing to customers  and bed retention 
in each geographic market  there are national  regional and local institutional pharmacies that provide services comparable to those offered by the corporation s pharmacies 
these pharmacies may have greater financial and other resources than we do and may be more established in the markets they serve than we are 
the corporation also competes against regional and local pharmacies that specialize in the highly fragmented long term care markets 
in the future  some of the corporation s customers may seek to in source the provision of pharmaceuticals to patients in their facilities by establishing an internal pharmacy 
a variety of factors are affecting the institutional pharmacy industry 
with an aging population and the extension of drug coverage to a greater number of individuals through medicare part d  the consumption of pharmaceuticals by residents of long term care facilities is likely to increase in the future 
in addition  individuals are expected to enter assisted living facilities  independent living facilities and continuing care retirement communities at increasing rates 
under medicare part d  eligible individuals may choose to enroll in various medicare part d plans to receive prescription drug coverage 
each medicare part d plan determines a distinct formulary for the long term care residents enrolled in its plan 
accordingly  institutional pharmacies have incurred increased administrative costs to manage each part d plan s formulary  reimbursement and administrative processes for their long term care enrollees 
institutional pharmacies may continue to experience increased administrative burdens and costs due to the greater complexity of the requirements for drug reimbursement 
medicare part d also requires increased choices for patients with respect to complex drug categories and therapeutic interchange opportunities 
institutional pharmacies may realize increased revenue by providing long term care residents with specialized services in these areas 
continued industry consolidation may also impact the dynamics of the institutional pharmacy market 
in addition  our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals 
competition for qualified pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals is strong 
the loss of pharmacy personnel or the inability to attract  retain or motivate sufficient numbers of qualified pharmacy professionals could adversely affect our business 
although we generally have been able to meet our staffing requirements for pharmacists and other pharmacy professionals in the past  our inability to do so in the future could have a material adverse impact on us 

table of contents acquisitions during the periods presented for a discussion of acquisitions by the corporation during the periods presented see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
the corporation s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and with the corporation s independent registered public accounting firm  and they both have reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to critical accounting estimates 
the table of critical accounting estimates is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the corporation s accounting policies that require estimates 
management believes that of the significant accounting policies  as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  the estimates discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the corporation 
the table that follows presents information about our critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate 
our sensitivity analysis was performed assuming the assumptions listed  based upon the actual results of the corporation for the year ended december   and the actual diluted shares 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for doubtful accounts accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from pdp s under medicaid part d  long term care institutions  the respective state medicaid programs  private payers and third party insurance companies 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables is critical to our results of operations and cash flows 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of our receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
in addition  certain drugs dispensed are subject to being returned and the responsible paying party is due a credit for such returns 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  included in our balance sheets at december  and  were million and million  respectively 
our quarterly provision for doubtful accounts included in our income statements was as follows dollars in millions amount of revenues first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter excludes a million expense related to hurricane sandy 
see further discussion in note assumptions approach used the largest components of bad debts in our accounts receivable relate to the accounts for which private payers are responsible which we refer to as private and other  accounts for which our customers from long term care institutions are responsible for under medicare part a and owe us for the drug component of their patients stay at their respective institution and third party  medicare part d  and medicaid accounts that have been denied 
we attempt to collect the private and other accounts through various efforts 
we attempt to collect payments due from long term care institutions through billing and collecting in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
we attempt to collect from third party  medicare part d and medicaid accounts by obtaining the appropriate documentation and direct discussions with the payers 
in all cases  the drugs have been dispensed 
in general  we perform the following steps in collecting accounts receivable if possible  perform up front adjudication prior to dispensing the product  billing and follow up with third party payers  billing and follow up with long term care institutions  utilization of collection agencies  and other legal processes 
the corporation has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  which relies on analytical tools  specific identification  and benchmarks to arrive at a reasonable allowance 
no single statistic or measurement alone determines the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we monitor and review trends by payer classification along with the composition of our aging accounts receivable 
this review is focused primarily on trends in private and other payers  pdp s  dual eligible co payments  historic payment patterns of long term care institutions  and monitoring respective credit risks 
in addition  we analyze other factors such as revenue days in accounts receivables  denial trends by payer types  payment patterns by payer types  subsequent cash collections  and current events that may impact payment patterns of our long term care institution customers 
the following table shows our institutional pharmacy revenue days outstanding reflected in our institutional pharmacy net accounts receivable as of the dates indicated first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter sensitivity analysis if our provision as a percent of institutional revenue increases  our after tax income would decrease by approximately million or per diluted share 
this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate uncollectible accounts that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment 
our estimates may be impacted by economic conditions  success in collections  payer mix and trends in federal and state regulations

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item revenue recognition allowance for contractual discounts we recognize revenues at the time services are provided or products are delivered 
our sources of revenues for the years ended december    and are as follows of revenues of revenues of revenues medicare part d institutional healthcare providers medicaid private and other insured medicare hospital management fees total our sources of revenues for the quarters ended march  june  september  and december    and are as follows three months ended march  three months ended june  medicare part d institutional healthcare providers medicaid private and other insured medicare hospital management fees total three months ended september  three months ended december  medicare part d institutional healthcare providers medicaid private and other insured medicare hospital management fees total please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
assumptions approach used we recognize revenues at the time services are provided or products are delivered 
a significant portion of our revenues are billed to pdps under medicare part d  the state medicaid programs  long term care institutions  third party insurance companies  and private payers 
some claims are electronically adjudicated through online processing at the point the prescription is dispensed such that our operating system is automatically updated with the actual amount to be reimbursed 
as a result  our revenues and the associated receivables are based upon the actual reimbursement to be received 
for claims that are adjudicated on line and are rejected or otherwise denied upon submission  the corporation provides contractual allowances based upon historical trends  contractual reimbursement terms and other factors which may impact ultimate reimbursement 
amounts are adjusted to actual reimbursed amounts based upon cash receipts 
co payments for our services can be applicable under medicare part d  the state medicaid programs  and certain third party payers and are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are provided 
co payments under the medicaid programs and third party plans are generally billed to the responsible party as part of our normal billing procedures which are subject to normal collection procedures 
under medicare part d  institutional residents who are dual eligible have co payments due for up to the first thirty days of a beneficiary s stay in a skilled nursing facility subsequent to which the pdp s are responsible for reimbursement 
under certain circumstances  including state mandated return policies under various medicaid programs  we accept returns of medications and issue credit memorandums to the applicable payer 
product returns are generally processed in the period returned 
we estimate an amount for expected returns based on historical trends 
our hospital pharmacy management revenues represent contractually defined management fees and the reimbursement of costs associated with the direct operations of hospital pharmacies  which are primarily comprised of personnel costs 
sensitivity analysis if our reimbursement declined or was negatively impacted of revenues  the negative impact on net income would be million or per diluted common share 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item inventory and cost of drugs dispensed we have inventory located at each of our institutional pharmacy and specialty infusion locations 
our inventory is valued at the lower of first in  first out cost or market basis 
the inventory consists of prescription drugs  over the counter products and intravenous solutions 
our inventory relating to controlled substances is maintained on a manually prepared perpetual system to the extent required by the drug enforcement agency and state board of pharmacies 
all other inventory is maintained on a periodic system  through the performance of quarterly physical inventories at the end of each quarter 
all inventory counts are reconciled to the balance sheet account and differences are adjusted through cost of goods sold 
in addition  we record an amount of potential returns of prescription drugs based on historical rates of returns 
at december  and  our inventory on our consolidated balance sheets was as follows dollars in millions our annualized inventory turns were as follows first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter we receive rebates on purchases from various vendors and suppliers 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed discussion of our inventory 
assumptions approach used our inventory is valued at the lower of first in  first out cost or market basis 
our controlled prescription drugs are maintained on a perpetual inventory basis to the extent required by the dea 
all other inventory is maintained on a periodic basis 
we perform quarterly inventory counts at all locations with the use of our personnel and the use of third party inventory count teams under our supervision 
we perform quarterly inventory counts in the third month of each quarter 
all inventory counts are reconciled to the balance sheet account and differences are adjusted through cost of goods sold 
in addition  we record an amount of potential returns of prescription drugs based on historical rates of returns 
we account for rebates and other incentives received from vendors and suppliers  relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory  as a reduction to cost of goods sold and inventory 
we consider these rebates to represent product discounts  and as a result  the rebates are allocated as a reduction of product cost and relieved through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory 
sensitivity analysis actual inventory counts may include estimates based on amounts that may be dispensed from an open container 
in addition  items are reviewed for potential obsolescence 
a error rate in the count of prescription drugs in inventory would impact net income million  or per diluted common share 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item goodwill  other intangible assets and accounting for business combinations goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of trade names  customer relationship assets  and non compete agreements 
our goodwill included in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and was as follows dollars in millions our net intangible assets  included in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were as follows dollars in millions customer relationships trade name non competition agreements accumulated amortization please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed roll forward of our goodwill and intangible assets 
assumptions approach used the corporation performs an annual  and more frequent if necessary  qualitative assessment of its institutional pharmacy reporting unit to determine if it is necessary to proceed to the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
the corporation is not required to do so unless  based on the qualitative assessment  it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the qualitative analysis requires the corporation to examine a wide range of factors  including macro economic factors  industry and market considerations  overall financial performance of the corporation  and other relevant entity specific factors affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets  and changes in share price 
if the corporation must continue to step one  then we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows  industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
the purchase price of acquisitions are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance 
fair value estimates are determined by management based upon established market values of comparable assets  or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on assumptions and projections we believe to be currently reasonable and supportable 
the ultimate decision of allocations are that of management 
we assess for the potential impairment of intangible assets and finite lived assets recorded on the corporation s balance sheet whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during the third quarter of  the corporation recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million related to finite lived customer relationships 
the impairment was incurred as the result of non renewal of certain customer contracts 
the impairment was related to intangible assets acquired in an acquisition during the year ended december  these asset groups were assessed for recoverability and management determined the finite lived customer relationship assets to be impaired 
no other assets within the asset groups were deemed impaired 
using a discounted cash flow analysis  the corporation determined that the pre tax impairment charge of million was required to write the carrying value down to fair value  resulting in a decrease per diluted common share impact of 
the corporation recognized the impairment as a permanent write down of the cost basis and accumulated amortization of the affected assets 
no such impairment changes were taken for the years ended december  or december  sensitivity analysis we performed our annual testing for goodwill impairment as of december  and and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
if actual future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in the future 
our estimate of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable based upon current facts and circumstances 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon the corporation s annual income or loss for each respective accounting period 
the corporation recognizes an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that will result in a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the accompanying consolidated income statements 
the corporation also recognizes as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our deferred tax asset balances in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were as follows dollars in millions  including the impact of valuation allowances at december  the corporation also had a deferred tax liability of million 
our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were as follows dollars in millions significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions 
for an identified uncertain tax position to qualify for benefit recognition  the position must have at least a more likely than not chance of being sustained on its technical merits if challenged by relevant taxing authorities and taken by management to the court of last resort 
if an uncertain position does not meet this recognition threshold based on our analysis of applicable tax law  we establish a liability for the realized  but unrecognized tax benefit 
as of december   the corporation has no liability recorded for unrecognized tax benefits for us federal and state tax jurisdictions 
the corporation records accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated income statements 
we recognize the benefit for an uncertain tax position we have taken upon any one of the following conditions the recognition threshold is met due to changes in facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date  the tax position is effectively settled through examination  negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the tax position has expired 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed discussion of our accounting for income taxes 
assumptions approach used the first step in determining the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is identifying reporting jurisdictions where we have a history of tax and operating losses or are projected to have losses in future periods as a result of changes in operational performance 
we then determine if a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction 
the second step is to determine the amount of valuation allowance 
we will generally establish a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities related to the jurisdiction identified in step one of the analysis 
in certain cases  we may not reduce the valuation allowance by the amount of the deferred tax liabilities depending on the nature and timing of future taxable income attributable to deferred tax liabilities 
tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized in the corporation s consolidated financial statements if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether the position has met this recognition threshold  the corporation assumes that the appropriate taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the amount of benefit recognized in the corporation s consolidated financial statements for a tax position meeting the recognition threshold is determined by a measurement of the largest amount of benefit that is more than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
subsequent recognition  derecognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions is based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting date 
with respect to net deferred tax assets  the corporation considers all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
this includes an analysis of net operating loss carryforwards available under law  anticipated future income or loss  as well as tax planning strategies 
if the cumulative weight of evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized  a full or partial valuation allowance will be recognized based upon the qualitative and quantitative evidence examined 
sensitivity analysis our deferred tax assets exceeded our deferred tax liabilities by million as of december   including the impact of valuation allowances 
historically  we have produced taxable income and we expect to generate taxable income in future years 
therefore  we believe that the likelihood of our not realizing the tax benefit of our deferred tax assets is remote 
while we have generated taxable income in recent years and expect to continue to do so in the future  we have deferred tax assets in select states  including tax loss carryforwards that we expect to expire before we are able to fully use them to offset taxable income 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets 
if our conclusion about our ability to realize these deferred tax assets is incorrect  then our deferred tax assets would be understated or overstated at december  the irs may propose adjustments for items we have failed to identify as tax contingencies 
if the irs were to propose and sustain assessments we would incur additional tax payments for and plus the applicable penalties and interest 
the federal statute of limitations remains open for tax years through the corporation s consolidated us income tax returns for and are currently under examination by the irs

table of contents use of non gaap measures for measuring quarterly results the corporation calculates adjusted ebitda as provided in the reconciliation below and calculates adjusted ebitda margin by taking adjusted ebitda and dividing it by revenues 
the corporation calculates and uses adjusted ebitda as an indicator of its ability to generate cash from reported operating results 
the measurement is used in concert with net income and cash flows from operating activities  which measure actual cash generated in the period 
in addition  the corporation believes that adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are supplemental measurement tools used by analysts and investors to help evaluate overall operating performance and the ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
in addition  adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is used in conjunction with the corporation s debt leverage ratio and this calculation sets the applicable margin for the quarterly interest charge 
adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  is not the same calculation as this adjusted ebitda table 
adjusted ebitda does not represent funds available for the corporation s discretionary use and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operating activities data as measured under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the items excluded from adjusted ebitda but included in the calculation of the corporation s reported net income and cash flows from operating activities are significant components of the accompanying consolidated income statements and cash flows  and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance 
the corporation s calculation of adjusted ebitda may not be consistent with calculations of ebitda used by other companies 
the following are reconciliations of adjusted ebitda to the corporation s net income and net operating cash flows for the periods presented 
the corporation calculates and uses adjusted diluted earnings per share  which is exclusive of the impact of merger  acquisition  integration costs and other charges  hurricane sandy disaster costs  impairment of intangible assets  and tax accounting matters as an indicator of its core operating results 
the measurement is used in concert with net income and diluted earnings per share  which measure actual earnings per share generated in the period 
the corporation believes the exclusion of these charges in expressing earnings per share provides management with a useful measure to assess period to period comparability and is useful to investors in evaluating the corporation s operating results from period to period 
adjusted diluted earnings per share  which is exclusive of the impact of merger  acquisition  integration costs and other charges  hurricane sandy disaster costs  impairment of intangible assets  and tax accounting matters does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders ie  such costs are a reduction in earnings and stockholders equity and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for earnings per diluted common share as measured under gaap 
the impact of merger  acquisition  integration costs and other charges  hurricane sandy disaster costs  impairment of intangible assets  and tax accounting matters excluded from the earnings per diluted share are significant components of the accompanying consolidated income statements and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of overall financial performance
