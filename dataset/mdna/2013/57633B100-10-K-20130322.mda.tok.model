item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a domestic provider of it and specialized healthcare staffing services to mostly large and medium sized organizations 
from july until our september  spin off  we conducted our business as subsidiaries of igate 
we do not sell  lease or otherwise market any computer software or hardware  and of our revenues are derived from the sale of information technology and specialized healthcare staffing services 
on january   we acquired curastat  inc  an arizona based provider of specialized healthcare staffing services 
this acquisition furthers our growth and service offering diversification strategies by providing an entry point into the specialized healthcare staffing space 
since the acquisition  we have expanded these operations geographically and added to our portfolio of service offerings 
this acquisition is more fully discussed in note  acquisition  to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
on january   the company sold its brokerage operations service offerings operated under the name global financial services of nevada  as more fully discussed in note  divestiture of our brokerage operations service offerings to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
economic trends and outlook generally  our business outlook is highly correlated to general us economic conditions 
during periods of increasing employment and economic expansion  demand for our services tends to increase 
conversely  during periods of contracting employment and or a slowing domestic economy  demand for our services tends to decline 
as the economy slowed during the last half of and recessionary conditions emerged in and during much of  we experienced less demand for our staffing services 
during the second half of  we began to see signs of market stabilization and a modest pick up in activity levels within certain sales channels and technologies 
during  market conditions continued to strengthen over the course of the year and activity levels within most of our sales channels progressively improved 
in and  activity levels have continued to trend up in most technologies and sales channels 
as we enter  we are encouraged by the recent strengthening of the domestic job market 
in addition to tracking general us economic conditions  a large portion of our revenues are generated from a limited number of clients see item a  the risk factor entitled our revenues are highly concentrated and the loss of a significant client would adversely affect our business and revenues 
accordingly  our trends and outlook are additionally impacted by the prospects and well being of these specific clients 
by way of illustration  during the second half of  while general us economic conditions were positive  we experienced a decline in billable headcount and negative sequential quarterly revenue growth due to client specific conditions at two of our larger clients 
this account concentration factor may result in our results of operations deviating from the prevailing us economic trends from time to time 
in recent years  a larger portion of our revenues have come from our wholesale it sales channel  which consists largely of strategic relationships with systems integrators and other staffing organizations 
this channel tends to carry lower gross margins  but provides higher volume opportunities 
this trend in our business mix has impacted overall gross margins during the past several years and  if this trend continues  will likely impact future gross margins as well 
within our retail it sales channel  many large users of it staffing services are employing managed service providers msp to manage their contractor spending in an effort to drive down overall costs 
this trend towards utilizing the msp model has resulted in lower gross margins in the retail it channel over the last two years and it is likely that our gross margins will be pressured in future periods should this trend continue

in order to minimize the impact of the industry trends mentioned above on our operating margins  the company will need to continue to lower its operating cost structure as a percentage of revenues through innovation and greater efficiencies 
investments in our global recruitment centers  aimed at improving operational effectiveness  and costs rationalization efforts throughout our entire organization  are examples of past actions that have resulted in lower operating costs

table of contents reflects returning million of capital to our shareholders during in the form of share repurchases million and cash dividends million 
the cash dividend was declared by our board of directors as a one time special dividend and we do not anticipate adopting a recurring dividend program at this time 
historically  we have funded our business needs with cash generated from operating activities 
in the staffing services industry  investment in operating working capital levels defined as current assets minus cash and cash equivalents and current liabilities  excluding short term borrowings is a significant use of cash 
controlling our operating working capital levels by closely managing our accounts receivable balance is an important element of cash preservation 
our accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso s measurement was days at december  and we believe that effectively managing our dso s has been an important factor in maximizing our cash flows in recent years 
cash provided by operating activities  our cash and cash equivalents balances on hand at december  and current availability under our credit facility are expected to be adequate to fund our business needs over the next months 
below is a tabular presentation of cash flow activities for the periods discussed years ended december  cash flows activities amounts in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively

our commitments are as follows payments due by period amounts in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total operating leases borrowings under credit facility we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation we do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  we attempt to minimize any effects of inflation on our operating results by controlling operating costs and  whenever possible  seek to ensure that billing rates reflect increases in costs due to inflation 
seasonality our operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations 
however  our consultants billable hours are affected by national holidays and vacation patterns 
accordingly  we typically have lower utilization rates and higher benefit costs during the fourth quarter 
foreign currency exchange the company is exposed to foreign currency risks as a result of its indian based global recruitment centers 
during  the company s expenditures in indian rupees  in support of these operations  increased significantly due to staff expansion and a new office lease in new delhi which is denominated in indian rupees 
to mitigate and manage the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts in as a hedge to such exposures 
critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows and require the application of significant judgment by management  and as a result  are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  our management uses judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
these estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observances of industry trends and other available information from outside sources  as appropriate 
the following explains our most critical accounting policies 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements  contained in item  of this annual report on form k for a complete description of our significant accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on time and material contracts as services are performed and expenses are incurred 
time and material contracts typically bill at an agreed upon hourly rate  plus out of pocket expense reimbursement 
out of pocket expense reimbursement amounts vary by assignment  but on average represent approximately to of total revenues 
revenue is earned when the company s consultants are working on projects 
revenue recognition is negatively impacted by holidays and consultant vacation and sick days 
in certain situations related to client direct hire assignments  where the company s fee is contingent upon the hired resource s continued employment with the client  revenue recognition is deferred until such employment conditions are satisfied 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts the company extends credit to clients based upon management s assessment of their creditworthiness 
a substantial portion of the company s revenue  and the resulting accounts receivable  are from fortune companies  major systems integrators and other staffing organizations 
unbilled receivables represent amounts recognized as revenues based on services performed and  in accordance with the terms of the client contract  will be invoiced in a subsequent period 
accounts receivable are reviewed periodically to determine the probability of loss 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts when it is probable that the related receivable balance will not be collected based on historical collection experience  client specific collection issues  and other matters the company identifies in its collection monitoring 
goodwill goodwill is the excess costs of acquired enterprises over the sum of the fair value amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired  less the fair value of liabilities assumed 
goodwill is not amortized  but reviewed for impairment in accordance with asc topic intangibles  goodwill and other 
the company has elected to test for goodwill impairment on december st of each year 
in the first step of goodwill impairment testing  management compares the fair value of the reporting unit  which is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis  to the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets at the measurement date 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment calculation requires an allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired at the measurement date 
the excess fair value determined in step over the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied value of goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill is then compared to the implied value of goodwill and any excess of carrying value over implied value is recognized as goodwill impairment 
our annual impairment review process requires extensive use of judgments and financial estimates  such as appropriate discount rates  growth rates and future cash flow assumptions 
the company s  and goodwill impairment analysis resulted in a goodwill impairment of  and  respectively 
the impairment change recognized in is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations

the assumptions associated with this option pricing model and other information related to our stock incentive plan are more fully described in note stock based compensation to the consolidated financial statements  included in item herein 
income taxes the company records an estimated liability for income and other taxes based on what management determines will likely be paid in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters  including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions  and may differ from the amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the amount recorded 
management determines the company s income tax provision using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect to recover or settle the temporary differences 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in the period that the change is enacted

during  the company s expenditures in indian rupees  in support of these operations  have increased significantly 
accordingly  to mitigate and manage the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts in june these forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments and qualified as effective hedges at inception under asc topic derivatives and hedging 
the company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
the effective portion of the changes in the fair value on these instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are reclassified into the consolidated statement of operations on the same line item and in the same period in which the underlying hedge transaction affects earnings 
changes in the fair value of these instruments deemed ineffective are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as foreign exchange gains losses 
forward points premiums discounts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as foreign exchange gains losses 

table of contents with respect to derivatives designed as hedges  the company formally documents all relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking such transactions 
the company evaluates hedge effectiveness at the time a contract is entered into and on an ongoing basis

this perpetual project will facilitate codification updates for technical corrections  clarifications  and improvements  and should eliminate the need for periodic agenda requests for narrow and incremental items 
these amendments are referred to as technical corrections and improvements 
the board decided that the types of issues that it will consider through this project are changes to clarify the codification or correct unintended application of guidance that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities 
in addition  this update includes more substantive  limited scope improvements 
these are items that represent narrow and incremental improvements to us gaap and are not purely technical corrections 
the amendments in this update include items raised to the board through the codification s feedback mechanism and are items that the board concluded met the scope of this project  rather than that of a maintenance update  making an amendment necessary 
maintenance updates include nonsubstantive corrections to the codification  such as editorial corrections  various types of link related changes  and changes to source fragment information that is used for the cross reference and printer friendly with sources options of the codification

the first definition originating from fasb statement no 

revised  share based payment  and the third definition originating from statement remain 
the conforming amendments to us gaap included in this update are generally nonsubstantive in nature 
many of the amendments conform wording to be consistent with the terminology in topic  for example  revising market value and current market value to fair value  or mark to market to subsequently measure at fair value 
the board does not anticipate that the amendments in this update will result in pervasive changes to current practice 
however  certain amendments may result in a change to existing practice
