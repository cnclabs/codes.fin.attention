part i item business overview we are a global medical technology company that develops  manufactures  and markets noninvasive patient monitoring products 
our mission is to improve patient outcomes and reduce cost of care by taking noninvasive monitoring to new sites and applications 
we were incorporated in california in may and reincorporated in delaware in may we invented masimo signal extraction technology  or masimo set  which provides the capabilities of measure through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry to address the primary limitations of conventional pulse oximetry 
pulse oximetry is the noninvasive measurement of the oxygen saturation level of arterial blood  or the blood that delivers oxygen to the body s tissues  and pulse rate 
pulse oximetry is one of the most common measurements made in and out of hospitals around the world 
masimo set has been validated in over independent clinical studies and is the only pulse oximetry technology we are aware of that has been proven to help clinicians detect critical congenital heart disease  or cchd  in newborns  reduce retinopathy of prematurity in neonates  and decrease intensive care unit transfers and rapid response activations on the general floor 
our products consist of a monitor or circuit board  and a recently introduced board in cable solution  for use with our proprietary single patient use and reusable sensors and cables 
we sell our products to end users through our direct sales force and certain distributors  and also sell some of our products to our original equipment manufacturer  or oem  partners  for incorporation into their products 
as of december   we estimate that the worldwide installed base of our pulse oximeters and oem monitors that incorporate masimo set was  units  based on an estimated year field life assumption 
our installed base is the primary 
table of contents driver for the recurring sales of our sensors  most notably  single patient adhesive sensors 
based on industry reports  we estimate that the worldwide pulse oximetry market was over billion in  the largest component of which was the sale of sensors 
after introducing masimo set  we have continued to innovate by introducing breakthrough noninvasive measurements beyond arterial blood oxygen saturation level and pulse rate  which create new market opportunities in both the hospital and non hospital care settings 
in  we launched our masimo rainbow set platform  utilizing both masimo set and licensed rainbow technology  which we believe includes the first devices cleared by the us food and drug administration  or fda  to noninvasively and continuously monitor multiple measurements that previously required invasive or complicated procedures 
in  we launched noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin  or spco  allowing measurement of carbon monoxide levels in the blood 
carbon monoxide is the most common cause of poisoning in the world 
when used with other clinical variables  spco may help clinicians and emergency responders detect carbon monoxide poisoning and help determine treatment and additional test options 
in  we launched noninvasive methemoglobin  or spmet  allowing for the measurement of methemoglobin levels in the blood 
methemoglobin in the blood leads to a dangerous condition known as methemoglobinemia  which occurs as a reaction to some common drugs used in hospitals and outpatient procedures 
when used with other clinical variables  spmet may help clinicians detect methemoglobinemia and help determine treatment and additional test options 
in  we launched masimo pleth variability index  or pvi 
fluid administration is critical to optimizing fluid status in surgery and critical care  but traditional invasive methods to guide fluid administration often fail to predict fluid responsiveness and newer methods are complicated and costly 
when used with other clinical variables  pvi may help clinicians assess fluid status and help determine treatment options 
in march  we debuted noninvasive hemoglobin  or sphb  and in march  we began full market release of sphb 
hemoglobin is the oxygen carrying component of red blood cells  and is one of the most frequent invasive laboratory measurements in the world  often measured as part of a complete blood count 
a low hemoglobin status is called anemia  which is generally caused by bleeding or the inability of the body to produce red blood cells 
when used with other clinical variables  sphb may help clinicians assess bleeding and anemia status and help determine treatment and additional test options 
sphb has been shown to help clinicians reduce the number of red blood cell  or rbc  transfusions and in multiple cases demonstrate its lifesaving ability to detect bleeding earlier  without having to wait for traditional invasive blood tests results 
in june  we began a full commercial release of continuous and noninvasive monitoring of respiration rate  or rra tm  via rainbow acoustic monitoring tm 
respiration rate is the number of breaths per minute 
a low respiration rate is indicative of respiratory depression and high respiration rate is indicative of patient distress 
traditional methods used to measure respiration rate are often considered inaccurate or are not tolerated well by patients 
when used with other clinical variables  rra tm may help clinicians assess respiratory status and help determine treatment options 
in july  we began selling the sedline monitor  which measures the brain s electrical activity and provides information about a patient s response to anesthesia 
we also offer a remote monitoring and clinician notification solution called the masimo patient safetynet tm  or patient safetynet tm  which includes our masimo set or rainbow set monitors at the patient s bedside along with a central assignment station and wired or wireless server 
patient safetynet tm wirelessly notifies clinicians caring for multiple patients in different rooms when one of their patients has an alarm  allowing them to intervene sooner and provide potentially life saving support 
masimo set  along with patient safetynet tm  is proven to help clinicians improve outcomes on the general floor 
in october  we debuted the halo index tm  which allows continuous global trending and assessment of multiple physiological measurements of a patient with a single number displayed on the patient safetynet tm screen 
halo index tm is pending fda k clearance 
in january  we received fda clearance for the pronto  a product designed specifically for spot checking hemoglobin  along with oxygen saturation  pulse rate and perfusion index 
in october  we received both fda clearance for uspo tm  a universal board in cable pulse oximetry solution  and ce mark for spfo  a new parameter  which for the first time  allows the measurement of fractional arterial oxygen saturation noninvasively 

table of contents in march  we acquired spire semiconductor  llc  a maker of advanced light emitting diode and other advanced component level technologies 
masimo semiconductor will operate the business going forward  and specialize in wafer epitaxy  foundry services  and device fabrication for biomedical  telecommunications  consumer products and other markets 
the acquisition gives us an advanced ability to develop custom components  accelerate development cycles  and optimize future product costs 
in july  we acquired phasein ab  or phasein  a developer and manufacturer of ultra compact mainstream and sidestream capnography and gas monitoring technologies 
the acquisition of phasein s technologies complements our breakthrough innovations for patient monitoring with a portfolio of products ranging from oem solutions for external plug in and measure capnography and gas analyzers and integrated modules to handheld capnometer devices 
with multiple measurements delivered through either mainstream or sidestream options  our customers can benefit from co  coo  co  and anesthetic agent monitoring in many hospital environments  such as operating rooms  procedural sedation and intensive care units 
in december  we released ispo  a pulse oximeter cable and sensor with measure through motion and low perfusion masimo set technology for use with an iphone  ipad or ipod touch 
ispo uses masimo set for measure through motion and low perfusion performance 
the first version of ispo allows consumers to use their iphone  ipad or ipod touch to check their own arterial blood oxygen saturation spo  pulse rate  and perfusion index measurements for short term sports and aviation use  and is not intended for medical use 
the ispo is available on line through both ispocom and amazon 
com 
the ispo medical  the professional version for medical use  is pending ce mark and fda k clearance 
the ispo medical will be made available through our existing distribution channels 
we offer masimo set and rainbow set through our oems and our own end user products  including the radical  rad  rad tm  pronto  pronto  rad  rad and rad v tm 
our strategy is to utilize the accuracy and clinical applications of our products to be the leading choice for pulse oximetry in traditionally monitored areas in and out of the hospital  expand the use of pulse oximetry beyond the critical care settings  including to the general floor of the hospital  enable the use of breakthrough rainbow measurements by our hospital customers  and bring rainbow measurements to new markets such as the outpatient clinic 
our solutions and related products are based upon our proprietary masimo set and rainbow algorithms 
this software based technology is incorporated into a variety of product platforms depending on our customers specifications 
our technology is supported by a substantial intellectual property portfolio that we have built through internal development and  to a lesser extent  acquisitions and license agreements 
as of december   we had issued and pending patents worldwide 
we have exclusively licensed from our development partner  cercacor laboratories  inc  or cercacor  the right to oem selected rainbow technology and to incorporate selected rainbow technology into our products intended to be used by professional caregivers  including  but not limited to  hospital caregivers and alternate care facility caregivers 
pulse oximetry background pulse oximetry has gained widespread clinical acceptance as a standard patient vital sign measurement because it can give clinicians an early warning of low arterial blood oxygen saturation levels  known as hypoxemia 
early detection is critical because hypoxemia can lead to a lack of oxygen in the body s tissues  which can result in organ damage or death in a matter of minutes 
our pulse oximeters are used primarily in critical care settings  including surgery  recovery rooms  intensive care units  or icus  emergency departments and alternative care settings  such as long term care facilities and for home monitoring of patients with chronic conditions 
in addition  clinicians use pulse oximeters to estimate whether there is too much oxygen in the blood  a condition called hyperoxemia 
in premature babies  hyperoxemia can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness 
by ensuring that oxygen saturation levels in babies remain under  clinicians believe they can lower the 
table of contents incidence of hyperoxemia 
hyperoxemia can also cause problems for adults  such as increased risk of postoperative infection and tissue damage 
in adults  to prevent hyperoxemia  clinicians use pulse oximetry monitoring to guide the administration of oxygen to maintain normal saturation levels 
pulse oximeters use sensors attached to an extremity  typically the fingertip 
these sensors contain two light emitting diodes that transmit red and infrared light from one side of the extremity through the tissue to a photodetector on the other side of the extremity 
the photodetector in the sensor measures the amount of red and infrared light absorbed by the tissue 
a microprocessor then analyzes the changes in light absorption to provide a continuous  real time measurement of the amount of oxygen in the patient s arterial blood 
pulse oximeters typically give audio and visual alerts  or alarms  when the patient s arterial blood oxygen saturation level or pulse rate falls outside of a user designated range 
as a result  clinicians have the opportunity to immediately initiate treatment to prevent the serious clinical consequences of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia 
limitations of conventional pulse oximetry conventional pulse oximetry is subject to technological limitations that reduce its effectiveness and the quality of patient care 
in particular  when using conventional pulse oximetry  oxygen saturation measurements can be distorted by motion artifact  or patient movement  and low perfusion  or low arterial blood flow at the measurement site 
motion artifact can cause conventional pulse oximeters to inaccurately measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation level  due mainly to the movement and recognition of venous blood 
venous blood  which is partially depleted of oxygen  may cause falsely low oxygen saturation readings 
low perfusion can also cause conventional pulse oximeters to report inaccurate measurement  or in some cases  no measurement at all 
conventional pulse oximeters cannot distinguish oxygenated hemoglobin  or the component of red blood cells that carries oxygen  from dyshemoglobins  which are hemoglobin bound with carboxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin and are therefore incapable of carrying oxygen 
in addition  conventional pulse oximetry readings can also be impacted by bright light and electrical interference from the presence of electrical surgical equipment 
independent  published research shows that conventional pulse oximeters are subject to operating limitations  including inaccurate measurements  which can lead to the non detection of a hypoxemic event or improper and unnecessary treatment  false alarms  which occur when the pulse oximeter falsely indicates a drop in the arterial blood oxygen saturation level  and which can lead to improper therapy  the inefficient use of clinical resources as clinicians respond to false alarms  or the non detection of a true alarm if clinicians become desensitized to frequently occurring false alarms  and signal drop outs  which is the loss of a real time signal as the monitor attempts to find or distinguish the pulse  and which can lead to the non detection of hypoxemic events 
independent research shows that over of the alarms outside the operating room are false when using conventional pulse oximetry 
in addition  in the operating room  conventional pulse oximeters can fail to give measurements due to weak physiological signals  or low perfusion  in up to of all cases studied 
manufacturers of conventional pulse oximeters have attempted to address some of these limitations  with varying degrees of success 
some competing devices have attempted to minimize the effects of motion artifact by repeating the last measurement before motion artifact is detected  until a new  clean signal is detected and a new measurement can be displayed  known as freezing values 
other competing devices have averaged the signal over a longer period of time  known as long averaging  in an attempt to reduce the effect of brief periods of motion 
still other competing devices extend the audible alarm notification delay  which reduces the awareness of inaccurate measurements 
these competing solutions  commonly referred to as alarm management techniques  mask the limitations of conventional pulse oximetry 
several published studies have demonstrated that these alarm management techniques contribute to increased occurrences of undetected true alarms  or events where hypoxemia occurs  but is not detected by the pulse oximeter 

table of contents conventional pulse oximetry technology also has several practical limitations 
because the technology cannot consistently measure oxygen saturation levels of arterial blood in the presence of motion artifact or low perfusion  conventional pulse oximetry is limited in non critical care settings of the hospital  such as general care areas  where the hospital staff to patient ratio is significantly lower 
in order for pulse oximetry to become a standard patient monitor in these settings  these limitations must be overcome 
in addition  pulse oximeters cannot distinguish oxygenated hemoglobin from dyshemoglobin  including the most prevalent forms of carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin 
as a result of these dyshemoglobins  pulse oximeters will report falsely high oxygen levels when they are present in the blood 
we revolutionized pulse oximetry by inventing signal extraction technology  which allows pulse oximeters to measure through motion and low perfusion 
in addition  with the invention of rainbow technology  we can also measure noninvasive and continuous carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin  as well as hemoglobin 
the invasive technology that measures carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin amongst other things  including arterial oxygen saturation and hemoglobin  is called a co oximeter 
we describe our noninvasive rainbow technology as pulse co oximetry tm 
pulse oximetry market opportunity the pulse oximetry market consists of pulse oximeter devices  boards  and consumables  including single patient use and reusable sensors  cables and other pulse oximetry accessories that are primarily sold to the hospital and alternative care markets 
based on available estimates for the us and international market  we estimate that the worldwide pulse oximetry market was more than billion in according to a idata research report  the pulse oximetry market is expected to continue to grow  primarily due to an aging baby boomer population which will contribute to the increasing use of healthcare services 
in addition  the market for peripheral pulse oximetry is expected to continue to grow with an industry wide push for more low acuity monitoring in both hospitals and alternate care facilities 
new market opportunities for masimo set pulse oximetry general floor monitoring expansion we believe there are opportunities to expand the market for pulse oximetry by applying masimo set s proven benefits from critical care settings to non critical care settings  as well as settings outside of the hospital 
the th annual healthgrades patient safety in american hospitals study looked at patient safety indicators for million hospitalized patients and concluded that many deaths and permanent disabilities could be avoided if hospitals adopted safe practices and implemented systems that facilitate patient safety 
the cost associated with post operative respiratory failure is estimated to be over billion 
a landmark study published in january by the journal of anesthesiology from dartmouth hitchcock medical center demonstrated that clinicians using masimo set and patient safetynet tm identified patient distress earlier  which decreased rapid response team activations by and icu transfers by  and reduced icu days by days annually 
a follow up report in the anesthesia patient safety foundation journal by dartmouth hitchcock in reported that since december  no patients have died or had serious brain injuries as a result of respiratory depression from opioids 
in addition  dartmouth hitchcock reported that expanding the use of masimo set and patient safetynet tm to all general and thoraco vascular post surgical units produced similar results to those seen in the original orthopedic unit 
they also reported savings of  per patient  or million annually  for patients who were not transferred to the icu from the original orthopedic unit 
in august  the joint commission issued a sentinel event alert  urging all hospitals to introduce measures to improve safety for patient receiving opioids  including systematic protocols to assess pain and appropriate opioid 
table of contents dosing  as well as continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation 
we believe that this sentinel event alert will significantly increase the general floor monitoring rate of adoption of masimo set and patient safetynet tm 
the american hospital association estimated that there were  staffed beds in all us registered hospitals in in  according to a study published in the journal of critical care medicine  of all hospital beds in the us were located in a non critical care setting  which suggests a non critical care market potential of  beds in the us alone 
while some of these non critical care beds have some form of monitoring capabilities today  we believe that or more of the  beds in the us alone could become continuous monitoring beds 
we believe that masimo set s ability to dramatically minimize false alarms due to patient motion while maximizing the sensitivity of pulse oximeters to report true alarms will allow hospitals to reliably and continuously monitor their patients in the general floors 
alternate care according to a idata market research report  the fastest growing portion of the us pulse oximetry equipment market is in the alternate care market 
we believe that masimo set technology offers significant advantages in some segments of this market  including home care  post acute care hospitals  and sleep diagnostics 
the proven ability of masimo set to dramatically reduce false alarms and increase true event detection enables clinicians to make more reliable diagnoses of those who have pulmonary or cardiac abnormalities  need oxygen therapy  or need continuous positive airway pressure therapy 
we plan to leverage this opportunity and expand our presence in this market 
new market opportunities for pulse co oximetry or masimo rainbow set masimo rainbow set creates additional demand for our pulse oximetry circuit boards  monitors and sensors because customers desire the rainbow set noninvasive measurement capabilities that are not available with any other pulse oximeter technology 
to date  over oem companies have released rainbow set equipped products or announced rainbow integration plans 
companies with released rainbow set products include physio control  welch allyn  zoll  dr ger  gs corpuls  bmeye  saadat and more 
companies that have announced rainbow set integration  but have not yet released products  include atom medical  carefusion  ge medical systems and philips 
in addition  more than additional companies are actively working on rainbow integration but have not yet publicly announced their integration plans 
there are significant opportunities with rainbow set to create new hospital and alternate care markets by enabling the monitoring of additional noninvasive measurements beyond arterial blood oxygen saturation level and pulse rate 
hemoglobin sphb in may  we received clearance from the fda for our continuous hemoglobin monitoring technology and in september  we began shipping  in a limited market release  these monitors and sensors 
in march  we fully launched our continuous noninvasive hemoglobin device 
hemoglobin is the part of a red blood cell that carries oxygen to the body and therefore a measurement of the hemoglobin parameter is an indicator of the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood 
a low hemoglobin status is called anemia  which is generally caused by bleeding or the inability of the body to produce red blood cells 
as a chronic disorder  anemia can be treated by iron supplements  diet changes or drugs that increase the production of red blood cells 
as an acute disorder  anemia due to bleeding requires stoppage of the bleeding before organ dysfunction or death occurs  or a rbc transfusion to sustain organ function and life 
because of its clinical importance  hemoglobin is one of the most commonly ordered lab diagnostic tests in the hospital and physician office 
each year in the us  over million invasive hemoglobin tests are performed  which require multiple steps  including collecting the patient s blood sample  transferring the sample to the lab  analyzing the sample  documenting the results and reporting the results to the ordering clinician 

table of contents a low or falling hemoglobin measurement provides the primary indication for whether a patient receives a rbc transfusion 
a rbc transfusion is the most frequent procedure performed in us hospitals  with one in ten inpatients receiving one or more units of blood 
rbc transfusions are highly variable by institution  procedure and physician 
evidence from observational studies shows rbc transfusions can increase mortality by and morbidity by  while restrictive transfusion practices have been proven safe in multiple randomized controlled trials 
blood transfusions are costly between and  per unit not accounting for morbidity costs 
many transfusions are unnecessary a systematic review of studies showed that are inappropriate 
there is a growing recognition of the need to implement strategies to reduce transfusions by groups such as the joint commission and the american medical association  with rbc transfusions recently targeted as one of the top five procedures that are overused 
in spite of the strong need to reduce rbc transfusions  existing tools for transfusion decision making are limited and may contribute to inappropriate transfusions 
for example  estimated blood loss is commonly much higher than actual blood loss  and laboratory hemoglobin values are only available intermittently and are often delayed 
it is estimated that with appropriate tools  processes and application of evidence based medicine  rbc transfusions could be reduced and save the us healthcare system up to billion per year  while significantly improving quality and safety 
at the american society of anesthesiologists scientific meeting in october  investigators from massachusetts general hospital presented the results of their study in which they evaluated the impact of sphb monitoring in a randomized controlled trial in orthopedic surgery patients 
patients in the standard care group had a transfusion rate and patients in the sphb monitoring group had a transfusion rate  an reduction in transfusion frequency with sphb 
patients in the standard care group had an average of units transfused and patients in the sphb monitoring group had an average of units transfused  a reduction in average units transfused 
based on the unit lower blood utilization per patient shown in the study and an estimated blood cost of to  per unit  sphb could reduce hospital costs by to per patient monitored 
it is possible that sphb monitoring may have an even greater benefit in populations with greater transfusion frequency and a greater number of average units transfused 
a low or falling hemoglobin measurement also helps determine whether a patient has internal bleeding that requires further investigation and intervention 
the later bleeding is discovered  the greater the patient risk and greater the potential for increased cost of treatment 
significant bleeding occurs in up to of surgical and icu patients 
a low hemoglobin measurement is associated with almost of patients with bleeding 
however  traditional laboratory measurements are both delayed and infrequent  and as a result  are late in identifying bleeding 
according to a study published in january by anesthesia and analgesia  undetected bleeding also occurs in otherwise healthy patients  such as mothers who have just delivered babies 
postpartum hemorrhage  or pph  is the leading cause of maternal mortality 
the direct pregnancy related maternal mortality rate in the us is to women per  live births  and of in hospital maternal deaths are caused by pph 
in the developing world  statistics suggest that of maternal deaths are due to pph  accounting for more than  maternal deaths per year  or woman every minutes 
when used with other clinical variables  masimo sphb may help clinicians assess bleeding status and help determine treatment and additional test options 
while clinical research studies on sphb are ongoing  clinicians inherently understand the value of continuous and noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring 
a study by the consulting firm capgemini concluded that the average bed hospital would save  annually by implementing sphb and other rainbow measurements 
because of the potential clinical and cost advantages of measuring hemoglobin noninvasively and continuously  we believe that a greater number of hospitals will adopt masimo rainbow set technology 
a significant portion of invasive hemoglobin measurements are made outside of hospital settings  in the physician office to aid patient assessment and treatment  and in the blood donation market to qualify potential 
table of contents donors for eligibility to donate blood 
we believe that a significant number of the estimated  us physician offices and estimated million annual us blood donations could be aided by the noninvasive and immediate assessment of hemoglobin 
beginning in january  the american medical association approved a current procedural terminology  or cpt  code and medicare implemented pricing on the medicare clinical lab fee schedule for noninvasive hemoglobin  enabling us hospitals and physician offices that perform testing to recover their costs  in addition to the clinical benefits they receive from this measurement 
in  the medicare reimbursement for sphb is per test when testing eligible patients 
carboxyhemoglobin spco carbon monoxide is a colorless  odorless and tasteless gas that is undetectable by humans and is often unknowingly inhaled from combustion fumes  or during fires by victims and first responders 
carbon monoxide poisoning is the leading cause of accidental poisoning death in the us  responsible for up to  emergency department visits and unintentional deaths annually 
carbon monoxide poisoning  which involves carbon monoxide binding with hemoglobin cells  thereby preventing them from carrying oxygen  can cause severe neurological damage  permanent heart damage or death in a matter of minutes 
quick diagnosis and treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning is critical in saving lives and preventing long term damage  but the condition is often misdiagnosed because symptoms are similar to the flu 
historically  carbon monoxide levels in the blood have been measured using a laboratory co oximeter  which requires a patient or a patient s blood sample to be transported to a hospital with laboratory co oximetry capability 
in one region of the country  it is estimated that only one half of acute care hospitals has laboratory co oximetry capabilities 
additional delays occur if a patient needs hyperbaric oxygen therapy  which often requires transfer to yet another medical center with hyperbaric capability 
when used with other clinical variables  masimo spco may help clinicians detect carbon monoxide poisoning and help determine treatment and additional test options 
according to a study by brown university  an emergency department using masimo rainbow set carbon monoxide monitoring identified more carbon monoxide poisoning cases than the conventional approach  and estimated that as many as  carbon monoxide poisoning cases per year in the us were being missed with the conventional approach 
in a study  based on three years of us data from the undersea and hyperbaric medicine society s carbon monoxide poisoning surveillance system supported by the centers for disease control  researchers analyzed cases of carbon monoxide poisoning treated with hyperbaric oxygen with initial carboxyhemoglobin level measured by either laboratory co oximetry or with spco from a rainbow pulse co oximeter 
patients who were initially measured using rainbow pulse co oximetry had a significantly shorter time to measurement of carbon monoxide versus hours and a shorter period of time from the end of carbon monoxide exposure to treatment versus hours 
three hours after exposure  of patients evaluated by pulse co oximetry had started treatment versus just of patients evaluated by laboratory co oximetry that had started treatment 
multiple leading emergency first responder associations  including the national association of emergency medical technicians  the national association of ems educators  the international association of fire fighters and the international association of fire chiefs  now educate their members that noninvasive assessment for carbon monoxide poisoning is appropriate when exposure is suspected or when an individual presents symptoms that could indicate such poisoning 
in addition  the national fire protection association  or nfpa  included carbon monoxide screening by pulse co oximetry as an available method as part of a new national healthcare standard for firefighters potentially exposed to carbon monoxide poisoning 
nfpa s consensus codes and standards serve as the worldwide authoritative source on fire prevention and public safety 
in addition  the united kingdom house of commons all party parliamentary gas safety group  in a report published in january  aimed at increasing the awareness of carbon monoxide poisoning among medical professionals  recommended noninvasive carbon monoxide testing for emergency department and alternate care 
table of contents market providers as a way to improve the country s rate of detection and diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning 
for the preparation of this report  the united kingdom group used masimo rainbow set rad tm devices for months and reported successful cases with the rad tm devices 
beginning january  the american medical association approved a cpt code and medicare implemented pricing on the medicare clinical lab fee schedule for noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin  enabling us hospitals that perform testing to recover their costs  in addition to the clinical benefits they receive 
in  the medicare reimbursement for spco is per day when testing eligible patients 
we believe that the first and greatest opportunity for noninvasive blood carbon monoxide monitoring is in the alternate care market and emergency department settings 
in the us alone  there are  fire departments alternate care market locations and  hospitals that would benefit from noninvasive carbon monoxide testing 
methemoglobin spmet methemoglobinemia reduces the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin for delivery to tissues and forces normal hemoglobin to bind more tightly to oxygen  releasing less oxygen to the tissues 
methemoglobinemia is often unrecognized or diagnosed late  increasing risk to the patient 
commonly prescribed drugs can introduce methemoglobin into the blood and cause methemoglobinemia 
some of the drugs that are known to cause methemoglobinemia are benzocaine  a local anesthetic  which is routinely used in procedures ranging from endoscopy to surgery  inhaled nitric oxide  routinely used in the neonatal intensive care unit  nitroglycerin  used to treat cardiac patients  and dapsone  used to treat infections for immune deficient patients  such as hiv patients 
according to a study published in september by researchers at johns hopkins university  over a month period there were cases  or of all patients reviewed  of acquired methemoglobinemia 
in these cases  the methemoglobinemia resulted in one fatality and three near fatalities 
warnings  cautions and alerts regarding the clinical significance and prevalence of methemoglobinemia have been generated by the fda  veterans administration  institute for safe medication practices  and the national academy of clinical biochemistry 
the american academy of pediatrics recommends monitoring methemoglobin levels in infants who receive nitric oxide therapy 
when used with other clinical variables  masimo spmet may help clinicians detect methemoglobinemia and help determine treatment and additional test options 
we believe the initial opportunity for methemoglobin monitoring is in outpatient procedure labs in hospitals  such as esophageal echocardiography and gastrointestinal labs where use of topical caines  such as benzocaine  is prevalent  monitoring hiv patients who receive dapsone  as well as monitoring neonates who receive inspired nitric oxide in the neonatal icus 
beginning january  the american medical association approved a cpt code and medicare implemented pricing on the medicare clinical lab fee schedule for noninvasive methemoglobin  enabling us hospitals that perform testing to recover their costs  in addition to the clinical benefits they receive 
in  the medicare reimbursement for spmet is per day when testing eligible patients 
pvi fluid is administered through intravenous catheters to surgical and intensive care patients as part of a key objective to ensure that vital tissues are getting enough oxygen 
however  too much fluid may cause harm to patients 
therefore  the decision of whether to administer fluid is of fundamental importance in critically ill and surgical patients 
ideally  a clinician would know prior to giving fluid whether the patient would respond favorably to the fluid  which is known as fluid responsiveness 
however  traditional methods such as central venous pressure monitoring often fail to predict fluid responsiveness  and newer methods are invasive  complicated and or costly 

table of contents multiple studies have shown that  when used with other clinical variables  pvi helps clinicians assess fluid responsiveness  defined as an increase in the amount of blood flow the heart pumps per minute  or cardiac output 
mechanical ventilation means that a machine called a respirator is controlling patient breathing 
pvi  which has been shown to help clinicians improve fluid management  has also been used by clinicians in goal directed therapy to reduce patient risk 
fluid management was improved by pvi by helping reduce the amount of fluid given to surgical patients  which lowered their patient risk as evidenced by a lowering of a key patient risk marker called lactate level 
we believe the primary opportunity for pvi monitoring is in mechanically ventilated adult patients during surgery and in the intensive care department in hospitals  but it is also possible that future studies may reveal application in non mechanically ventilated adult patients in the hospital and other out of hospital patient populations 
respiration rate rra tm we received fda clearance for rra tm with rainbow acoustic monitoring tm technology in november  announced initial market release of the parameter in december  and announced full market release in june respiration rate is defined as the number of breaths per minute  and changes in respiration rate provide an early warning sign of deterioration in patient condition 
current methods to monitor respiration rate include end tidal co monitoring  which requires a special tube to be inserted in the patient s nose and therefore has low patient compliance  and impedance monitoring  which is considered unreliable 
multiple clinical studies have shown that rra tm provides as good or better accuracy to monitoring respiration rate as end tidal co monitoring  and can reliably detect respiratory pause episodes  defined as a cessation of breathing for seconds or more 
our noninvasive respiration rate parameter is available in our masimo rainbow set platforms with the launch of mx circuit board  which was released in november these devices with the rra tm software and our acoustic respiration sensor are placed on the patient s neck and connected to the bedside monitor with a separate cable 
should the respiration rate change or stop  an alarm will be displayed on the device and in addition  can be sent to the patient safetynet tm system 
patient safetynet tm can then notify the attending clinician or nurse of the condition  directly on the monitor or remotely via a pager 
when used with other clinical variables  rra tm may help clinicians assess respiratory status and help determine treatment options 
we believe this noninvasive measurement will become a key and important measurement in the general floor environment  in the post anesthesia care unit  during procedural sedation such as in the gastrointestinal lab  as well as in the monitoring of non mechanically ventilated patients during surgery 
fractional arterial oxygen saturation spfo tm in october  we debuted spfo tm  a new parameter which  for the first time  allows the measurement of fractional arterial oxygen saturation noninvasively 
this parameter has received ce mark for the european union  but it is subject to fda k clearance before commercialization in the us until now  pulse oximeters could only measure and display functional oxygen saturation  or spo therefore  when patients had elevated carboxyhemoglobin from carbon monoxide poisoning and or elevated methemoglobin negative reaction to more than common drugs used in hospitals  like caines  nitrates  and dapsone  the displayed functional oxygen saturation overestimated the actual oxygen saturation value 
utilizing more than seven wavelengths of light and breakthrough signal processing  masimo rainbow pulse co oximeters can measure and display fractional arterial oxygen saturation 
spfo allows more precise arterial oxygenation assessment in patients with elevated dyshemoglobins  common throughout the hospital and pre hospital setting  compared to functional oxygen saturation 
spfo may allow earlier interventions and more timely therapeutic decisions 

table of contents halo index tm in october  we debuted halo index tm  which has received ce mark for the european union  but it is subject to fda k clearance before commercialization in the us halo index tm is a dynamic indicator that facilitates continuous global trending and assessment of multiple physiological measurements to quantify changes in patient status 
currently  clinicians monitor multiple clinical measurements on each patient and respond independently to each of the measurement 
halo index tm is a single displayed value on the patient safetynet tm remote monitoring and notification system  which facilitates simple and comprehensive assessment within a single index 
in the future  subject to fda clearance  we expect halo index tm will also be available as part of our standalone devices and oem boards 
as more clinical evidence is collected on halo index tm  its clinical utility in a variety of care areas and patient types will become more specific 
in vivo adjustment tm in october  in vivo adjustment tm received ce marking in the european union but is subject to fda k clearance in the us in the and radical  in vivo adjustment tm enables clinicians  for the first time  to adjust the noninvasive measurement of sphb to the specific patient and laboratory reference device they use for invasive blood testing 
in vivo adjustment tm is considered helpful to clinicians because the reference standard used in their hospital may differ from the reference standard used by masimo for calibration  inducing differences in the noninvasive measurement and the invasive measurement 
in addition  while calibration curves are developed over a large number of patients  variation can occur from the calibration curve for any single patient 
disruptive new technologies in general  our recent noninvasive measurement technologies are breakthrough products that are considered disruptive 
these disruptive technologies have performance levels that we believe are acceptable for many clinical environments  but in their present form may be insufficient in others 
in addition  these noninvasive measurement technologies may perform better in some patients and settings than others 
the performance of these technologies shows variability across a population that follows a standard gaussian distribution described in the accuracy specifications 
over time  we hope to reduce this variability and  if we do  we expect these recent noninvasive measurement technologies to become more useful in additional environments and to become more widely adopted 
this is the adoption pattern experienced historically with our other new noninvasive measurements  such as oxygen saturation  and what we expect to experience in the future with our current and future technologies 
sedline brain function monitoring in july  we began selling the sedline monitor  which measures the brain s electrical activity and provides information about a patient s response to anesthesia 
sedline enables monitoring of both sides of the brain simultaneously and provides density spectral array for immediate detection of asymmetrical activity 
sedline monitors enable more individualized titration of anesthesia and sedation for faster emergence  while offering reliable monitoring during challenging conditions such as electrocautery 
capnography and gas monitoring in july  we acquired phasein  a developer and manufacturer of ultra compact mainstream and sidestream capnography and gas monitoring technologies 
the acquisition of phasein s technologies complements our breakthrough innovations for patient monitoring with a portfolio of products ranging from oem solutions for external plug in and measure capnography and gas analyzers and integrated modules to handheld capnometer devices 
with multiple measurements delivered through either mainstream or sidestream options  our customers can benefit from co  no  n  and anesthetic agent monitoring in many hospital environments  such as operating rooms  procedural sedation and intensive care units 

table of contents future measurements we believe that our core signal processing and sensor technologies are widely applicable and may develop and launch future applications utilizing our proprietary technology platforms 
however  we do not plan to communicate the priority  status or timing of future measurements in development until such time that they have reached feasibility and or received regulatory clearance 
the masimo solution masimo set was designed to overcome the primary limitations of conventional pulse oximetry  which involve maintaining accuracy in the presence of motion artifact and weak signal to noise situations 
our masimo set platform  which became available to hospitals in the us in  is the basis of our pulse oximetry products and we believe represented the first significant technological advancement in pulse oximetry since its introduction in the early s 
in addition  our products benefits have been validated in over independent clinical and laboratory studies 
masimo set utilizes five signal processing algorithms  four of which are proprietary  in parallel  to deliver high precision  sensitivity and specificity in the measurement of arterial blood oxygen saturation levels 
sensitivity is the ability to detect true events and specificity is the ability to reject false alarms 
one of our proprietary processing algorithms  discrete saturation transform  separates the signal from noise in real time through the use of adaptive filtering and an iterative sampling technique that tests each possible saturation value for validity 
masimo set signal processing can therefore identify the venous blood and other noise  isolate them  and extract the arterial signal 
to complement our masimo set platform  we have developed a wide range of proprietary single patient use disposable and multi patient reusable sensors  cables and other accessories designed specifically to work with masimo set software and hardware 
although our technology platforms operate solely with our proprietary sensor lines  our sensors have the capability to work with certain competitive pulse oximetry monitors through the use of adapter cables 
our neonatal adhesive sensors have been clinically proven to exhibit greater durability compared to competitive sensors 
in response to the hospital market s growing needs to implement environmentally friendly  or green  products and to decrease costs to remain competitive  we developed the pulse oximetry resposable sensor system and began a limited market release in december the resposable sensor  part reusable and part disposable  combines the performance and comfort of single use adhesive sensors with the economic and green advantages of reusable sensors 
resposable sensors produce less waste and fewer carbon emissions than disposable sensors  while recycled sensors only decrease waste by and actually increase carbon emissions by compared to disposable sensors 
in  we introduced our masimo rainbow set platform  leveraging our masimo set technology and incorporating licensed rainbow technology to enable reliable  real time monitoring of additional measurements beyond arterial blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate 
the masimo rainbow set platform has the unique ability to distinguish oxygenated hemoglobins from certain dyshemoglobins  hemoglobins incapable of transporting oxygen  and allows for the rapid  noninvasive monitoring of hemoglobin  carboxyhemoglobin  methemoglobin and pvi  which we refer to as pulse co oximetry 
along with the release of our rainbow pulse co oximetry products  we have developed multi wavelength sensors that have the ability to monitor multiple measurements with a single sensor 
we believe that the use of masimo rainbow pulse co oximetry products will become widely adopted for the noninvasive monitoring of these measurements 
we believe the addition of rra tm with rainbow acoustic monitoring tm technology for noninvasive and continuous monitoring will strengthen the clinical demand for the rainbow platform  especially in the growing general floor market 
additionally  we market our patient safetynet tm remote monitoring and clinician notification system for use with our masimo set pulse oximeters and rainbow pulse co oximeters  which allow monitoring of the oxygen saturation and pulse rate of up to patients simultaneously 
patient safetynet tm offers a rich user 
table of contents interface with trending  and real time waveform capability at the central station and remote notification via pager or smart phones 
patient safetynet tm also features the adaptive connectivity engine tm  which enables two way  hl based connectivity to clinical hospital information systems 
the masimo connectivity engine significantly reduces the time and complexity to integrate and validate custom hl implementations  and demonstrates our commitment to innovation that automates patient care with open  scalable  and standards based connectivity architecture 
patient safetynet tm also allows the display of the new halo index tm  discussed earlier 
we believe that the advanced performance of the masimo set platform coupled with reliable  cost effective  and easy to use wireless remote monitoring will allow hospitals to create continuous surveillance solutions on general care floors where patients are at risk of avoidable adverse events and where direct patient observation by skilled clinicians is cost prohibitive 
we believe that our technologies and products offer multiple clinical and financial benefits  including masimo set pulse oximetry fewer false alarms and better true alarm detection 
over independent and objective studies have now proven masimo set accuracy during challenging conditions in adult  pediatric and neonatal patients 
increased detection of critical congenital heart disease through newborn screening 
four studies totaling  patients have shown that adding masimo set to the standard physical exam increases the detection of this potentially fatal disease before the baby leaves the hospital 
the published evidence for masimo set led the american academy of pediatrics and the us department of health and human services to recommend mandatory screening for all newborns using motion tolerant pulse oximeters that report functional oxygen saturation and have been validated in low perfusion conditions 
in  we received fda k clearance for masimo set pulse oximeters and neonatal sensors with labeling for screening newborns for cchd  marking the first time the fda has cleared specific labeling indicating the use of pulse oximeters  in conjunction with a physical exam  to screen newborns for cchd 
reduced retinopathy of prematurity in very low birth weight neonates 
in a two phased study of two centers that previously used competing pulse oximetry  both centers simultaneously changed their neonatal oxygen targeting policy  and one of the centers switched to masimo set pulse oximetry 
in the first phase of the study  there was no decrease in retinopathy of prematurity at the center using competing pulse oximetry but there was a reduction in significant retinopathy of prematurity and a reduction in the need for laser eye treatment at the center using masimo set 
in the second phase of the study  the center still using competing pulse oximetry switched to masimo set and it experienced similar results as the center already using masimo set fewer arterial blood gas measurements  faster oxygen weaning time  and lower length of stay in the icu 
with more accurate and reliable measurements from masimo set 
lower sensor utilization 
due to sensor durability and the ease of obtaining measurements with masimo set 
expansion into non critical care settings 
we believe the ability of masimo set products to provide reliable monitoring with fewer false alarms has expanded and will continue to expand the use of pulse oximetry into other settings where patient motion and false alarms have historically prevented its use 
since the introduction of masimo set  we believe that pulse oximetry has become a standard of care in the alternate care market 
earlier detection of patient distress on the general floor  enabling reduced icu transfers and rapid response activations 
many patients in the general care areas are at risk of dying due to inadequate oxygenation 
to mitigate this risk  patients in the general care areas need to be continuously monitored 
our patient safetynet tm systems enable the masimo set and rainbow set platforms to wirelessly 
table of contents and remotely monitor patients in the general care areas of the hospital that are not under the constant supervision of clinicians 
a landmark study published in by dartmouth hitchcock medical center demonstrated that clinicians using masimo set and patient safetynet tm identified patient distress earlier  which decreased rapid response team activations  icu transfers and icu days 
hospitals and other care centers can reduce their costs by moving less critically ill patients from the icu to the general care areas where these patients can be continuously and accurately monitored in a more cost effective manner 
upgradeable rainbow set platform for earlier and better decisions about patient care 
products with our mx circuit board contain our masimo set pulse oximetry technology as well as circuitry to support rainbow measurements 
at the time of purchase  or at any time in the future  our customers and our oems customers will have the option of purchasing a software measurement  which will allow the customer to expand their patient monitoring systems to monitor additional measurements with a cost effective solution 
the rainbow platform enables breakthrough noninvasive monitoring of measurements that previously required invasive testing  which may lead to earlier and better clinical decisions and decreased costs compared to standard care 
examples of the many benefits of breakthrough rainbow measurements include hemoglobin sphb helping clinicians reduce the risk and cost associated with rbc transfusions helping clinicians identify undetected bleeding earlier in surgical  intensive care  trauma  and obstetric patients helping clinicians identify anemia more rapidly and efficiently  and allowing them to assess patients for anemia in developing countries around the world carboxyhemoglobin spco helping clinicians identify deadly carbon monoxide poisoning earlier and more often  reducing incorrect diagnoses methemoglobin spmet helping clinicians identify dangerous methemoglobinemia earlier and more often  reducing incorrect diagnoses pleth variability index pvi helping clinicians assess fluid responsiveness and improve fluid management in surgical and intensive care patients who are mechanically ventilated respiration rate rra tm helping clinicians identify respiratory depression and respiratory distress earlier and more often halo index tm potentially helping clinicians identify patient distress earlier  more effectively  more easily  and more efficiently

we intend to continue to grow our business and to improve our market position by pursuing the following strategies continue to expand our market share in pulse oximetry 
we grew our product revenue to million in from million in  representing a three year cagr of 
this growth can be attributed to the increased access to pulse oximetry customers through our agreements with group purchasing organizations  or gpos  our increased relationships with oem partners  the expansion of our direct sales force  and strong  independent clinical evidence that demonstrates the benefits of our technology 
we supplement our direct sales with sales through our distributors 
direct and distributor sales increased to million  or  of product revenue in  from million  or  of product revenue in expand the pulse oximetry market to other patient care settings 
we believe the ability to continuously and accurately monitor patients outside of critical care settings  including the general care areas of the hospital  are currently unmet medical needs and have the potential to significantly improve patient care and increase the size of the pulse oximetry market 
we believe the ability of masimo set to accurately monitor and address the limitations of conventional pulse oximetry has enabled  and will continue to enable  us to expand into non critical care settings and thus significantly expand the market for our products 
to further support our expansion into the general care areas  we market patient safetynet tm  which enables continuous monitoring of up to patients oxygen saturation  pulse rate  and with rainbow set  noninvasive hemoglobin and respiration rate 
expand the use of rainbow technology in the hospital setting 
we believe the noninvasive measurement of rainbow pulse co oximetry hemoglobin  carboxyhemoglobin  methemoglobin  pvi  rainbow acoustic monitoring tm respiration rate  and the halo index tm  as well as future measurements  will provide an excellent opportunity to leverage existing customer relationships into new opportunities to improve patient care and our revenues  directly and through a greater ability to convert non masimo hospitals to masimo hospitals due to our expanded measurement capabilities 
expand the use of rainbow technology in the non hospital setting 
we believe the noninvasive measurement of hemoglobin creates a significant opportunity in markets such as the physician office  emergency departments  and blood donation centers  and noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin in the fire alternate care market 
to date  we have introduced our first noninvasive spot check hemoglobin device called pronto and  in january  we began full market release of pronto  utilizing the new 
table of contents rainbow d tm technology  as a noninvasive spot check hemoglobin device  along with oxygen saturation  pulse rate and perfusion index 
the pronto and pronto allow users to simply and quickly perform a spot check measurement of hemoglobin levels  one of the most common invasive laboratory measurements 
we believe that the ability to noninvasively measure hemoglobin will increase efficiency and improve clinical decision making in physician offices  emergency departments and blood donation centers  by enabling quick determination of hemoglobin levels and reducing the time required to take an invasive blood draw  create the labeling  send the sample to the lab  wait for the lab results often not until the next day  and communicate these results to the patient 
utilize our customer base and oem relationships to market our masimo rainbow set products incorporating licensed rainbow technology 
we sold our first masimo rainbow pulse co oximetry products in september we are currently selling our rainbow set products through our direct sales force and distributors 
in addition  we plan to sell our mx circuit boards in our own pulse oximeters and to our oem partners  equipped with circuitry to support rainbow pulse co oximetry measurements which can be activated at time of sale or through a subsequent software upgrade 
we believe that the clinical need of these measurements along with our installed customer base will help drive the adoption of our rainbow pulse co oximetry products 
continue to innovate and maintain our technology leadership position 
we invented and pioneered what we believe is the first pulse oximeter to accurately measure arterial blood oxygen saturation level and pulse rate in the presence of motion artifact and low perfusion 
in addition  we launched our rainbow set platform that enabled what we believe is the first noninvasive monitoring of carboxyhemoglobin  methemoglobin and hemoglobin  as well as pvi  which all previously required invasive testing 
with our introduction of rra tm with rainbow acoustic monitoring tm technology  we believe we have launched the first platform to enable noninvasive and continuous monitoring through an easy to use single patient adhesive acoustic sensor 
in october  we debuted halo index tm pending fda k clearance in the us halo index tm is a dynamic indicator that facilitates continuous global trending and assessment of multiple physiological measurements to quantify changes in patient status 
we plan to continue to innovate and develop new technologies and products  internally and through our collaboration with cercacor  whom we currently license carboxyhemoglobin  methemoglobin and hemoglobin from  for the noninvasive monitoring of other measurements 
our future growth strategy is also closely tied to our focus on international expansion opportunities 
since  we have been aggressively expanding our sales and marketing presence in europe  asia  canada and latin america 
we have accomplished this through both additional staffing and by adding or expanding sales offices in many of these territories 
during the fourth quarter of  we established a new international business structure designed to better serve and support our growing international business 
by centralizing our international operations  including sales management  marketing  customer support  planning  logistics and administrative functions  we believe we have developed a more efficient and scalable international organization capable of being even more responsive to the business needs of our international customers all under one centralized management structure 
as a result of these investments and focus on our international operations  we believe that our international product revenues  as a percent of total product revenues  will continue to increase 
our products we develop  manufacture and market a patient monitoring solution that incorporates a monitor or circuit board and sensors including proprietary single patient use  reusable and resposable sensors and patient cables 
in addition  we offer remote alarm monitoring solutions and software

masimo rainbow set mx circuit boards 
our next generation circuit board is the foundation for our masimo rainbow pulse co oximetry and rainbow acoustic monitoring tm platform  utilizing technology licensed from cercacor 
the mx circuit boards measure arterial blood oxygen saturation levels and pulse rate  and have the circuitry to enable the measurement of hemoglobin  oxygen content  carboxyhemoglobin  methemoglobin  pvi  respiration rate and halo index tm  along with other potential measurements in the future 
customers can choose to buy additional measurements beyond arterial blood oxygen saturation levels and pulse rate at the time of sale or at any time in the future through a field installed software upgrade 
as additional measurements are developed  each new measurement may be available as a software upgrade to the existing system 
uspo tm cable board 
our new set technology in a cable contains the low power ms technology in a reduced size  allowing it to be embedded into patient cables as part of the sensor connector 
this allows for the ability to interface the uspo tm cable board to monitoring devices externally via an existing communications port in instances where internal integration of a traditional masimo set technology board is not feasible 
the uspo tm cable board provides full masimo set measure through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry found in our other products  with a typical power consumption of less than milliwatts 
monitors devices radical 
we believe that the radical offers features that do not exist in any other pulse oximeter 
the radical incorporates the mx circuit board  which enables rainbow set measurements  and offers three in one capability to be used as a standalone device for bedside monitoring  a detachable  battery operated handheld unit for easy portable monitoring  and a monitor interface via satshare  a proprietary technology allowing our products to work with certain competitor products  to upgrade existing conventional multi parameter patient monitors to masimo set while displaying rainbow measurements on the radical itself 
the radical is a wireless  touch screen device  which is on an upgradeable rainbow set platform 
with its wide ranging flexibility  radical can continuously monitor a patient from the ambulatory environment  to the emergency room  to the operating room  to the general floor  and on until the patient is discharged 
radical delivers the accuracy and reliability of masimo rainbow set with multi functionality  ease of use and a convenient upgrade path for existing monitors 
satshare technology enables a conventional monitor to upgrade to masimo set through a simple cable connection from the back of radical to the sensor input port of the conventional monitor 
no software upgrades or new modules are necessary for the upgrade  which can be completed in minutes 
satshare allows hospitals to standardize the technology and sensors used throughout the hospital while allowing them to gain more accurate monitoring capabilities and additional multi functionality in a cost effective manner 
this technology has facilitated many hospital wide conversions of previously installed competitor monitors to masimo set 
in addition  masimo rainbow set measurements such as hemoglobin are available to clinicians on the radical itself while the device is being used in satshare mode 
rad 
the rad  which also contains masimo rainbow set technology  is a compact  lightweight and easy to use device designed specifically for use in less acute settings than the radical 
the rad is available with a built in bi directional wireless radio for use as part of the patient safetynet tm remote monitoring and clinician notification system 

table of contents pronto 
the pronto is a handheld noninvasive multi parameter testing device that uses masimo rainbow set technology to provide oxygen saturation  pulse rate  perfusion index and spot checking of hemoglobin levels for both hospitals ie  emergency departments and remote settings such as physician offices 
pronto 
the pronto is a noninvasive multi parameter device utilizing rainbow d tm that provides spot check hemoglobin testing along with oxygen saturation  pulse rate and perfusion index results

the rad is a bedside pulse oximeter featuring masimo set but without rainbow capability with a low cost design and streamlined feature set  allowing it to be offered at a lower price point than the radical or rad 
rad 
in addition to the bedside monitors  we have developed handheld pulse oximeters using masimo set but without rainbow capability 
our rad and rad v tm handheld oximeters were the first dedicated handhelds with masimo set 
rad tm 
the rad tm is a fully featured handheld pulse co oximeter that provides continuous  noninvasive measurement of hemoglobin  carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin in addition to oxygen saturation  pulse rate  and perfusion index 
its rugged and lightweight design makes it applicable for use in hospital and field settings  specifically for fire departments and emergency medical service units 
sedline monitor 
the sedline monitor measures brain function on a continuous basis 
the sedline monitor  an eeg based brain function monitor  provides information about a patient s response to anesthesia 
capnography and gas monitoring 
in july  we acquired phasein  a developer and manufacturer of ultra compact mainstream and sidestream capnography  gas analyzers and handheld capnometry solutions 
the gas analyzers  or irma tm and isa tm  and emergency capnometer  or emma tm  enable our customers to benefit from co  coo  co  and anesthetic agent monitoring in many hospital environments 
ispo pulse oximeter for use with an iphone  ipad or ipod touch 
the ispo uses masimo set for measure through motion and low perfusion performance  for consumers to check their own arterial blood oxygen saturation spo  pulse rate  and perfusion index measurements for short term sports and aviation use 
this version is not intended for medical use 
the ispo medical  the professional version for medical use  is pending ce mark and fda k clearance 
sensors sensors and cables 
we have developed one of the broadest lines of single patient use disposable  reusable and resposable sensors and cables 
in total  we have over different types of sensors to meet virtually every clinical need 
masimo set sensors are uniquely designed to reduce interference from physiological and non physiological noise 
our proprietary technology platforms operate only with our proprietary sensor lines 
however  through the use of adapter cables  we can connect our sensors to certain competitor pulse oximetry monitors 
we sell our sensors and cables to end users through our direct sales force and our distributors and oem partners 
our single patient use sensors offer several advantages over reusable sensors  including improved performance  cleanliness  increased comfort and greater reliability 
our reusable sensors are primarily used for short term  spot check monitoring 
our resposable sensors are expected to provide performance advantages for customers currently using reusable and reprocessed sensors 
softouch sensors 
we have developed softouch sensors  designed with less adhesive or no adhesive at all for compromised skin conditions 
these include single patient sensors for newborns and multi site reusable sensors for pediatrics and adults 

table of contents trauma and newborn sensors 
we believe we were the first to develop two specialty sensor lines  specifically designed for trauma and resuscitation situations  as well as for newborns 
these sensors contain an identifier which automatically sets the oximeter to monitor with maximum sensitivity and the shortest averaging mode and allows for quick application  even in wet and slippery environments 
additionally  we introduced low profile sensors to monitor oxygen saturation in newborns 
the newly enhanced low profile lncs  m lncs neo tm  neopt tm  and inf sensors tm are smaller and thinner  making them significantly more comfortable for patients and easier to apply for healthcare workers 
blue sensors 
in  we introduced what we believe to be the first fda cleared sensor to accurately monitor arterial blood oxygen saturation levels in cyanotic infants and children with abnormally low oxygen saturation levels 
e tm ear sensor 
in  we introduced the first ever  single patient use ear sensor that is placed securely in the ear conchae  so clinicians can combine masimo set performance and central monitoring to provide quick access and responsive assessment of oxygenation 
the e tm sensor is ideal for field emergency medical services utilization 
rainbow sensors 
we believe we were the first to develop proprietary  multi wavelength sensors for use with our rainbow pulse co oximetry products 
as opposed to traditional sensors that only have the capability to monitor arterial blood oxygen saturation levels and pulse rate  our rainbow sensors can also monitor carboxyhemoglobin  methemoglobin and hemoglobin 
our licensed rainbow set sensors are the only sensors that are compatible with our licensed rainbow set products 
rainbow sensors are available in single patient use  resposable  and reusable spot check sensor types 
rainbow acoustic sensors tm 
we believe we were the first to develop a continuous respiration rate monitoring technology based on an acoustic sensor placed on the patient s neck 
our rainbow acoustic sensors tm detect the sounds associated with breathing  and convert the sounds into continuous respiration rate using proprietary signal processing that is based on masimo set 
sedline sensor 
used exclusively with the sedline monitor  the sedline sensor is a disposable sensor that collects a high volume of brain function data from key areas of the frontal lobe 
rainbow universal resposable supersensor tm 
this sensor pending fda k clearance in the us  is the first noninvasive sensor to provide simultaneous monitoring of sphb  spco  spmet  spfo tm  spoc tm  perfusion index  pvi  and measure through motion and low perfusion spo and pulse rate 
we offer our customers choices for reducing pollution and waste in our world while also reducing costs  including masimo reprocessed sensors  the only reprocessing solution that maintains new masimo sensor performance  and masimo resposable sensors  offering unprecedented sustainability with a lower carbon footprint and greater waste reduction than reprocessing or new sensors 
masimo resposable sensors offer equivalent performance and comfort to single patient use sensors and a similar sensor price per patient to mixed third party reprocessed and new sensors 
remote alarm and monitoring solutions masimo patient safetynet tm 
patient safetynet tm is a remote monitoring and clinician notification system 
it instantly routes bedside generated alarms through a server to a qualified clinician s handheld paging device in real time 
each system can support up to bedside monitors and can either be integrated into a hospital s existing it infrastructure or operate as a stand alone wireless network 
software all of our monitors  including radical and certain future oem products  which incorporate the mx board  will allow purchases of software for rainbow measurements as well as other future measurements or features that can be field installed 

table of contents in addition  in october we debuted halo index tm pending fda k clearance in the us  which is a dynamic indicator that facilitates continuous global trending and assessment of multiple physiological measurements to quantify changes in patient status 
currently  clinicians monitor multiple clinical measurements on each patient and respond independently to each of the measurements 
halo index tm is a single displayed value on the patient safetynet tm remote monitoring and notification system  which facilitates simple and comprehensive assessment within a single index 
in the future  subject to receipt of regulatory clearance  we expect halo index tm will also be available as part of our standalone devices and oem boards 
as more clinical evidence is collected on halo index tm  its clinical utility in a variety of care areas and patient types will become more specific 
x cal tm in  we implemented a technology called x cal tm in our sensors  cables and instruments to enhance patient safety and improve clinician efficiency 
x cal tm preserves system quality  performance and reliability by reducing imitation sensor and cable use and monitoring component life 
the technical benefit of x cal tm is based on the fact that the masimo sensors  patient cables and instruments work as an integrated system to provide the physiologic measurements that have advanced the standard of care 
x cal tm addresses three common problems experienced by clinicians using an integrated masimo system  including patient safety may be severely compromised by using imitation masimo sensors and cables because they are not produced with comparable components  do not provide proper shielding from ambient interferences  create electrostatic noise caused by motion  do not have our quality and performance controls  and are not tested or warrantied to work within a masimo system  we design our sensors and cables to last well beyond their warranty and customer feedback indicates our sensors and cables last significantly longer than competing products  but cable and sensor reliability may still be compromised when used beyond the life they were reliably designed for  affecting patient care and causing clinicians and biomedical engineers to spend time troubleshooting intermittent cable and sensor issues  and third party reprocessed pulse oximetry sensors introduce challenges in the clinical environment because they are adulterated testing indicates that of a leading third party reprocessor s sensors tested fail to meet our performance specifications 
in fact  most third party reprocessed sensors do not indicate that they are capable of performing in measure through motion or low perfusion conditions or neonatal applications  as available with masimo set sensors 
also  no third party company has attempted to reprocess rainbow set sensors 
sales and marketing we have sales and marketing employees in the us and abroad 
we expect to continue to increase our worldwide sales and sales support organizations as we continue to expand our presence throughout both the us and throughout the world including europe  the middle east  asia  latin america  canada and australia 
we currently sell all of our products both directly to hospitals and the alternate care market via our sales force  and certain distributors 
the primary focus of our sales representatives is to facilitate the conversion of competitor accounts to our masimo set pulse oximetry products  expand the use of masimo set and patient safetynet tm on the general floor  and create new use of rainbow measurements in both critical care and non critical care areas 
in addition to sales representatives  we employ clinical specialists to work with our sales representatives to educate end users on the benefits of masimo set and assist with the introduction and implementation of our technology and products to their sites 
our sales and marketing strategy for pulse oximetry has been and will continue to be focused on building end user awareness of the clinical and cost saving benefits of our masimo set platform 
more recently  we have expanded this communication and educational role to include our masimo rainbow pulse co oximetry and rainbow acoustic monitoring tm products  including hemoglobin  carboxyhemoglobin  
table of contents methemoglobin  pvi  acoustic respiration rate  and halo index tm 
given the importance of continuous sphb monitoring  we have also begun to build a new  incremental sphb dedicated sales force whose primary focus will be working with hospitals to identify new opportunities to deploy this life saving and cost reducing technology 
while we have begun limited hiring in q  we expect to increase the size of this new sales organization throughout the balance of our direct and distributor revenue accounted for of our total product revenue in for the year ended december   owens minor and cardinal health  which are both just in time distributors  represented and  respectively  of our total revenue 
these were the only customers that represented or more of our revenue for the year ended december  importantly  distributors take and fulfill orders from our direct customers  many of whom have signed long term sensor purchase agreements with us 
as a result  in the event a specific just in time distributor is unable to fulfill these orders  the orders will be redirected to other distributors or fulfilled directly by us 
additionally  we sell certain of our products through our oem partners who both incorporate our boards into their monitors and resell our sensors to their customers installed base of masimo set products 
our oem agreements allow us to expand the availability of masimo set through the sales and distribution channels of each oem partner 
to facilitate clinician awareness of masimo set installations  all of our oem partners have agreed to place the masimo set logo prominently on their instruments 
in order to facilitate our direct sales to hospitals  we have signed contracts with companies that we believe to be the five largest gpos  based on the total volume of negotiated purchases 
in return for the gpos putting our products on contract  we have agreed to pay the gpos a percentage of our revenue from their member hospitals 
in and  revenue from the sale of our pulse oximetry products to hospitals that are associated with gpos amounted to million and million  respectively 
our marketing efforts are designed to build end user awareness through digital and print advertising  direct mail and trade shows 
in addition  we distribute published clinical studies  sponsor accredited educational seminars for doctors  nurses  biomedical engineers  and respiratory therapists and conduct clinical evaluations 
during  we expect to modestly increase the size of our sales and marketing force worldwide  as we continue to establish and expand our sales channels on a global basis 
competition the medical device industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
while we regard any company that sells pulse oximeters as a potential customer  we also recognize that the companies selling pulse oximeters on an oem basis and or pulse oximetry sensors are also potential competitors 
our primary competitor  covidien ltd 
and its subsidiary nellcor puritan bennett  inc  currently hold a substantial share of the pulse oximetry market 
covidien sells its own brand of nellcor pulse oximeters to end users  sells pulse oximetry modules to other monitoring companies on an oem basis  and licenses to certain oems  the right to make their pulse oximetry platforms compatible with nellcor sensors 
we face substantial competition from larger medical device companies  including companies that develop products that compete with our proprietary masimo set 
we believe that a number of companies have announced products that claim to offer measure through motion accuracy 
based on those announcements and our investigations  we further believe that many of these products include technology that infringes our intellectual property rights 
we have settled claims against some of these companies and intend to vigorously enforce and protect our proprietary rights with respect to the others whom we believe are infringing our technology 
some of the remaining companies  including ge medical systems and mindray medical international ltd  are also currently oem partners of ours 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market for pulse oximetry products include accurate monitoring during both patient motion and low perfusion  ability to introduce other clinically beneficial measurements related to oxygenation and respiration  such as noninvasive and continuous hemoglobin and respiration rate

joe kiani  our chairman and chief executive officer  is also the chairman and chief executive officer of cercacor 
we have a cross licensing agreement  or the cross licensing agreement  with cercacor for certain technologies 
the following table outlines our rights under the cross licensing agreement relating to specific end user markets and the related technology applications of specific measurements 
end user markets measurements professional caregiver and alternate care market patient and pharmacist vital signs masimo owns cercacor non exclusive license non vital signs masimo exclusive license cercacor owns or exclusive license vital signs measurements include  but are not limited to  spo  peripheral venous oxygen saturation  mixed venous oxygen saturation  fetal oximetry  sudden infant death syndrome  ecg  blood pressure noninvasive blood pressure  invasive blood pressure and continuous noninvasive blood pressure  temperature  respiration rate  co  pulse rate  cardiac output  eeg  perfusion index  depth of anesthesia  cerebral oximetry  tissue oximetry and or emg  and associated features derived from these measurements  such as d alarms  pvi and other features 
non vital signs measurements include the body fluid constituents other than vital signs measurements and include  but are not limited to  carbon monoxide  methemoglobin  blood glucose  hemoglobin and bilirubin 
our license to cercacor 
we granted cercacor an exclusive  perpetual and worldwide license  with sublicense rights  to use all masimo set owned by us for the monitoring of non vital signs measurements and to develop and sell devices incorporating masimo set for monitoring non vital signs measurements in the cercacor market 
we also granted cercacor a non exclusive  perpetual and worldwide license  with sublicense rights  to use masimo set for the measurement of vital signs in the cercacor market 
in exchange  cercacor pays us a royalty on the amount of vital signs sensors and accessories sold by cercacor 
the cercacor market is defined as any product market in which a product is intended to be used by a patient or pharmacist rather than a professional medical caregiver regardless of the particular location of the sale  including sales to doctors  hospitals  alternate care market professionals or otherwise  provided the product is intended to be recommended  or resold  for use by the patient or pharmacist 
cercacor s license to us 
we exclusively licensed from cercacor the right to make and distribute products in the masimo market that utilize rainbow technology for the measurement of carbon monoxide  methemoglobin  fractional arterial oxygen saturation and hemoglobin  which includes hematocrit 
additionally  we make and 
table of contents distribute products that monitor respiration rate via rainbow acoustic monitoring tm  which is not required to be licensed from cercacor 
to date  we have developed and commercially released devices that measure carbon monoxide  methemoglobin and hemoglobin using licensed rainbow technology 
we also have the option to obtain exclusive licenses to make and distribute products in the masimo market that utilize rainbow technology for the monitoring of other non vital signs measurements  including blood glucose 
these licenses are exclusive until the later of years from the grant of the applicable license or the expiration of the last patent included in the rainbow technology related to the applicable measurements 
the masimo market is defined as those product markets where the product is intended to be used by a professional medical caregiver  including hospital caregivers  surgicenter caregivers  paramedic vehicle caregivers  doctor s offices caregivers  alternate care facility caregivers and vehicles where alternative care services are provided 
our license to rainbow technology for these measurements in these markets is exclusive on the condition that we continue to pay cercacor royalties on our products incorporating rainbow technology  subject to certain minimum aggregate royalty thresholds  and that we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or market products incorporating the licensed rainbow technology 
the royalty is up to of the rainbow royalty base  which includes handhelds  tabletop and multi parameter devices 
handheld products incorporating rainbow technology will carry a royalty rate 
for other products  only the proportional amount attributable for that portion of our devices used to monitor non vital signs measurements  rather than for monitoring vital signs measurements  and sensors and accessories for measuring only non vital sign parameters will be included in the rainbow royalty base 
for multi parameter devices  the rainbow royalty base will include the percentage of the revenue based on the number of rainbow enabled measurements 
for hospital contracts where we place equipment and enter into a sensor contract  we pay a royalty to cercacor on the total sensor contract revenue based on the ratio of rainbow enabled devices to total devices 
during the year ended december  and going forward  we are subject to a certain specific annual minimum aggregate royalty payment obligation of million per year 
we have days after proof of feasibility to exercise the above referenced option to obtain a license for the measurement of blood glucose for an additional million and licenses for the remaining non vital signs measurements  including bilirubin  for an additional  each 
as of december   feasibility on these measurements has not been attained 
during the year ended december   cercacor incurred a total of million in operating expenses 
change in control 
the cross licensing agreement provides that  upon a change in control if the surviving or acquiring entity ceases to use masimo as a company name and trademark  all rights to the masimo trademark will be assigned to cercacor  the option to license technology developed by cercacor for use in blood glucose monitoring will be deemed automatically exercised and a million license fee for this technology will become immediately payable to cercacor  per product minimum royalties  to the extent less than the annual minimums  will be payable to cercacor  and the minimum aggregate annual royalties for all licensed rainbow measurements payable to cercacor is million per year until the exclusive period of the agreement ends  plus up to million for each additional rainbow measurement 
a change in control includes any of the following with respect to us or cercacor the sale of all or substantially all of either company s assets to a non affiliated third party  the acquisition by a non affiliated third party of or more of the voting power of either company  
table of contents joe kiani  our chief executive officer and the chief executive officer of cercacor  resigns or is terminated from his position with either company  and the merger or consolidation of either company with a non affiliated third party 
ownership of improvements 
any improvements to masimo set or rainbow technology made by cercacor  by us  or jointly by cercacor with us or with any third party that relates to non vital signs monitoring  and any new technology acquired by cercacor  is and will be owned by cercacor 
any improvements to the masimo set platform or rainbow technology made by cercacor  by us  or jointly by cercacor with us or with any third party that relates to vital signs monitoring  and any new technology acquired by us  is and will be owned by us 
however  for both non vital signs and vital signs monitoring  any improvements to the technology  excluding acquired technology  will be assigned to the other party and be subject to the terms of the licenses granted under the cross licensing agreement 
any new non vital signs monitoring technology utilizing masimo set that we develop will be owned by cercacor and will be subject to the same license and option fees as if it had been developed by cercacor 
also  we will not be reimbursed by cercacor for our expenses relating to the development of any such technology 
cercacor services agreement 
we have also entered into a services agreement  or the services agreement  with cercacor 
under this services agreement  we provide cercacor with accounting  human resources and legal services  which we collectively refer to as indirect expenses 
we expect cercacor to continue to engage us for these services 
however  pursuant to the services agreement  cercacor may terminate the agreement by providing us a day notice  while we may terminate with a day notice to cercacor 
cercacor s expenses related to pronto 
in february  we and cercacor agreed that in order to accelerate the development of the technology supporting this product  cercacor would re direct a substantial amount of its engineering development activities to focus on this project for our benefit 
accordingly  we and cercacor agreed that from april through june  the completion of this product development effort  of cercacor s engineering and engineering related expenses and all third party engineering supplies expense related to pronto development would be charged to us 
since july  cercacor has continued to assist us with other product development efforts and charged us accordingly 
beginning in  due to a revised estimate of the support required by us to complete the various pronto related projects  our board of directors approved an increase in the percentage of cercacor s total engineering and engineering related payroll expenses funded by us from to 
for the year ended december   the total funding for these additional cercacor expenses was million 
both companies have agreed to maintain this arrangement until we notify cercacor that we no longer require this engineering support 
research and product development we believe that ongoing research and development efforts are essential to our success 
we expect to increase the size of our research and development staff during our research and development efforts focus primarily on continuing to enhance our technical expertise in pulse oximetry  enabling the noninvasive monitoring of other measurements and developing remote alarm and monitoring solutions 
although we and cercacor each have separate research and development projects  we collaborate with cercacor on multiple research and development activities related to rainbow technology and other technologies 
under the cross licensing agreement  the parties have agreed to allocate proprietary ownership of technology developed by either party based on the functionality of the technology 
we will have proprietary rights to all technology related to the noninvasive measurement of vital signs measurements  and cercacor will have proprietary ownership of all technology related to the noninvasive monitoring of non vital signs measurements 
our total research and development expenditures for were million  which included million related to expenses incurred by cercacor pursuant to the cross licensing agreement 
in  our total research and development expenditures were million  which included million related to expenses incurred by cercacor 
in  our total research and development expenditures were million  which included 
table of contents million related to expenses incurred by cercacor 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in and beyond as we expand our research and development force  enhance our existing products and technologies and develop new product candidates 
intellectual property we believe that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace  we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property 
we have developed a patent portfolio internally  and to a lesser extent through acquisitions and licensing  that covers many aspects of our product offerings 
as of december   we had issued patents and pending applications in the us  europe  japan  australia  canada and other countries throughout the world 
in addition  as of december   technology we licensed from our development partner  cercacor  was supported by issued patents and pending applications in the us and internationally 
some of our earliest patents began to expire in some of cercacor s earliest patents begin to expire in additionally  as of december   we owned us registered trademarks and foreign registered trademarks  as well as trade names that we use in conjunction with the sale of our products 
under the cross licensing agreement  we and cercacor have agreed to allocate proprietary ownership of technology developed based on the functionality of the technology 
we will have proprietary ownership  including ownership of all patents  copyrights and trade secrets  of all technology related to the noninvasive monitoring of vital signs measurements  and cercacor will have proprietary ownership of all technology related to the noninvasive monitoring of non vital signs measurements 
we also rely upon trade secrets  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary know how  in part  with confidentiality agreements with consultants  vendors and employees  although we cannot be certain that the agreements will not be breached  or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach 
there are risks related to our intellectual property rights 
for further detail on these risks  see item a risk factors 
government regulation fda s premarket clearance and approval requirements unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the us must first receive either k clearance  by filing a k pre market notification  or pma approval  by filing a premarket approval application  or pma  from the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months  but it can take longer 
the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
it generally takes from one to three years or even longer 
we cannot be sure that k clearance or pma approval will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market 
the fda decides whether a device must undergo either the k clearance or pma approval process based upon statutory criteria 
these criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed 
devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either class i or ii  which generally requires the manufacturer to submit a pre market notification requesting k clearance  unless an exemption applies 
class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the fda s general regulatory controls  or general controls  for medical devices  which include compliance with the applicable portions of the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  facility registration and product listing  reporting of 
table of contents adverse medical events  and appropriate  truthful and non misleading labeling  advertising  and promotional materials 
some class i devices also require premarket clearance by the fda through the k premarket notification process 
class ii devices are subject to the fda s general controls  and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device 
premarket review and clearance by the fda for class ii devices is accomplished through the k premarket notification procedure 
all of our current devices are class ii devices 
class iii devices are those devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk  such as life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices  or those devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device 
the safety and effectiveness of class iii devices cannot be assured solely by the general controls and the other requirements described above 
these devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below 
premarket approval applications  and supplemental premarket approval applications  are subject to significantly higher user fees under the medical device user fee and modernization act of  or mdufma  than are k premarket notifications  and generally take much longer for the fda to review 
to obtain k clearance  a company must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in technological and performance characteristics to a legally marketed predicate device that is either in class i  class ii  or is a class iii device that was in commercial distribution before may   for which the fda has not yet called for submission of a pma application 
pursuant to the mdufma and the mdufma ii provisions of the food and drug amendments act of  unless a specific exemption applies  k premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees 
after a device receives k clearance  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance or could require a pma approval 
the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any decision 
if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer s decision not to seek a new k clearance  the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek k clearance or pma approval 
the fda also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until k clearance or pma approval is obtained 
we have modified some of our k cleared devices  and in some cases  we have determined that new k clearances or pma approvals are not required based on fda guidance regarding when to submit a new k notification for changes to a cleared device 
we cannot assure you that the fda would agree with any of our decisions not to seek additional k clearances or even pma approval for these or future device modifications 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance or pma approval for any modification  we also may be required to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until we obtain a new k clearance or pma approval 
class iii devices are required to undergo the pma approval process in which the manufacturer must establish the safety and effectiveness of the device to the fda s satisfaction 
a pma application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding  among other things  device design  manufacturing and labeling 
also during the review period  an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device 
in addition  the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the qsr 
a new pma or a pma supplement is required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device  including  for example  certain types of modifications to the device s indications for use  manufacturing process  manufacturing facility  labeling and design 
pma supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original pma application  except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma application  and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 
none of our products are currently approved under a pma 

table of contents a clinical trial may be required in support of a k submission and generally is required for a pma application 
these trials generally require an investigational device exemption  or ide  application approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients  unless the proposed study is deemed a non significant risk study  which is eligible for an exemption from the ide requirements 
the ide application must be supported by appropriate data  such as animal and laboratory testing results 
clinical trials may begin if the ide application is approved by the fda and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites 
even if a trial is completed  the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain fda clearance to market the product in the us we also recently launched the marketing of ispo  a non medical use pulse oximeter intended for short term sports and aviation use 
we are marketing these products in accordance with the fda s current policy and enforcement discretion which indicates that pulse oximeters that are not intended for medical purposes can be marketed direct to consumers without first obtaining clearance of a k 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not change its policy regarding the regulation of these products 
if the fda changes its policy  we may be required to seek k clearance to market these pulse oximeters 
we also may be required to cease marketing and or recall the products until we obtain a new k clearance 
we believe that our oem partners may be required to obtain k premarket clearance from the fda for certain of their products that incorporate masimo set or masimo rainbow set circuit boards and sensors 
in order to facilitate our oem partners in obtaining k clearance for their products that incorporate masimo set or masimo rainbow set boards and sensors  we grant our oem partners a right to cross reference the files from our cleared masimo set circuit boards  sensor  cable and notification system k submissions 
in the future  we may be required to submit additional k submissions to the fda to address new claims  uses or products 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not deem one or more of our future products  or those of our oem partners  to be a class iii device subject to the more burdensome pma approval process 
the fda also may not approve or clear these products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization 
indeed  the fda may refuse our requests for k clearance or pma of new products  new intended uses or modifications to existing products 
pervasive and continuing fda regulation after a device is placed on the market  numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply 
those regulatory requirements include product listing and establishment registration  which helps facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory action  qsr  which requires manufacturers  including third party manufacturers  to follow stringent design control  testing  change control  documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the development and manufacturing process  labeling control and advertising regulations  including fda prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared  unapproved or off label uses or indications  clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices  approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our future approved devices  medical device reporting  or mdr  regulations  which require that manufacturers comply with fda requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur  post approval restrictions or conditions  including post approval study commitments  
table of contents post market surveillance requirements  which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device  the fda s recall authority  whereby it can ask  or under certain conditions order  device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of its conditions of approval  governing laws and or regulations  regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls  and notices of corrections or removals 
we must also register with the fda as a medical device manufacturer  list all products placed in commercial distribution and obtain all necessary state permits or licenses to operate our business 
as a manufacturer  we are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the fda to determine our compliance with fda s qsr and other regulations 
our oem partners also are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda to determine compliance with regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that we or one of our oem partners have failed to comply  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines and civil penalties  unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions  delays in clearing or approving  or refusal to clear or approve  our products  withdrawal or suspension of approval of our products or those of our third party suppliers by the fda or other regulatory bodies  product recall or seizure  interruption of production  operating restrictions  injunctions  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us 
our failure  or the failure of our oem partners  to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
advertising and promotion of medical devices  in addition to being regulated by the fda  are also regulated by the federal trade commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities 
recently  promotional activities for fda regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement actions brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes 
in addition  under the federal lanham act and similar state laws  competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims 
if the fda determines that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use  it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions  including the issuance of an untitled letter  a notice of violation  a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine or criminal penalties 
in that event  our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired 
foreign regulation many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the fda 
international sales are subject to foreign government regulation  the requirements of 
table of contents which vary substantially from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda clearance and the requirements may differ 
companies are now required to obtain the ce mark prior to sale of some medical devices within the european union 
during this process  the sponsor must demonstrate compliance with the international organization for standardization s manufacturing and quality requirements 
we do have ce marking on all of our products that require such markings 
we cannot assure you that we or our oem partners will be able to obtain necessary foreign government approvals or successfully comply with foreign regulations 
our failure to do so could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
other us regulation we and our oem partners also must comply with numerous federal  state and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and hazardous substance disposal 
we cannot be sure that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future or that these laws or regulations will not hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the physician payment sunshine act  or sunshine act  which was enacted by congress as part of the patient protection and affordable care act  or ppaca  on march   requires medical device companies to track and publicly report  with limited exception  all payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals in the us implementing regulations for these tracking and reporting obligations have not been finalized  but it is anticipated that companies will be required to begin tracking payments in early and will be required to report payments to the government by march   and annually thereafter 
the government is required to post this data on a public  searchable  government maintained website 
failure to comply with the data collection and reporting obligations imposed by the sunshine act can result in civil monetary penalties 
in addition  the international electrotechnical commission  or iec  rd edition  was published in december in this publication  standards are listed as general requirements concerning basic safety and the essential performance of equipment 
these new standards were required to be in place by june  in europe and will be required to be in place by june  in the us for new submissions 
failure to adhere to this regulation will prevent us from using our equipment in our clinical trials 
as a result  we could be found in breach of existing customer contracts and or unable to obtain new contracts  both of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
medical device tax in march  the us congress adopted and president obama signed into law comprehensive health care reform legislation 
among other initiatives  these laws impose significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a excise tax on us medical device sales  with certain exemptions  beginning on january  we currently estimate our medical device tax  which will be recorded within our selling  general and administrative expenses  to be in the range of million to million for environmental our manufacturing processes involve the use  generation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  including silicone adhesives  solder and solder paste  sealants  epoxies and various solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone  acetone and isopropyl alcohol 
as such  we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing the use  handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes 
products that we sell in europe are subject to regulation in european union  or eu  markets under the restriction of the use of hazardous substances directive  or rohs 
rohs prohibits companies from selling products which contain certain hazardous materials  including lead  mercury  cadmium  
table of contents chromium  polybrominated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers  in eu member states 
in addition  the eu s registration  evaluation  authorization  and restriction of chemicals directive also restricts substances of very high concern in products 
future environmental laws may require us to alter our manufacturing processes  thereby increasing our manufacturing costs 
we believe that our products and manufacturing processes at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws  however  the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated 
health care fraud and abuse in the us  there are federal and state anti kickback laws that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks  bribes or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health related business 
for example  the federal health care programs anti kickback law usc a b b prohibits anyone from  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting or receiving any bribe  kickback or other remuneration intended to induce the referral of patients for  or the purchase  order or recommendation of  health care products and services reimbursed by a federal health care program  including medicare and medicaid 
recognizing that the federal anti kickback law is broad and potentially applicable to many commonplace arrangements  congress and the office of inspector general within the department of health and human services  or oig  have created statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors 
exceptions and safe harbors exist for a number of arrangements relevant to our business  including  among other things  payments to bona fide employees  certain discount and rebate arrangements  and certain payment arrangements involving gpos 
although an arrangement that fits into one or more of these exceptions or safe harbors is immune from prosecution  arrangements that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor do not necessarily violate the law  but the oig or other government enforcement authorities will examine the practice to determine whether it involves the sorts of abuses that the statute was designed to combat 
violations of this federal law can result in significant penalties  including imprisonment  monetary fines and assessments  and exclusion from medicare  medicaid and other federal health care programs 
exclusion of a manufacturer  like us  would preclude any federal health care program from paying for its products 
in addition to the federal anti kickback law  many states have their own laws that parallel and implicate anti kickback restrictions analogous to the federal anti kickback law  but may apply regardless of whether any federal health care program business is involved 
federal and state anti kickback laws may affect our sales  marketing and promotional activities  educational programs  pricing and discount practices and policies  and relationships with health care providers by limiting the kinds of arrangements we may have with hospitals  alternate care market providers  gpos  physicians and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products 
federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for payment to third party payers that are false or fraudulent 
for example  the federal civil false claims act usc et seq 
imposes liability on any person or entity who  among other things  knowingly and willfully presents  or causes to be presented  a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program  including medicaid and medicare 
some suits filed under the false claims act  known as qui tam actions  can be brought by a whistleblower  or relator on behalf of the government and such individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement 
manufacturers  like us  can be held liable under false claims laws  even if they do not submit claims to the government  where they are found to have caused submission of false claims by  among other things  providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims  or by engaging in kickback arrangements with customers that file claims 
a number of states also have false claims laws  and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under medicaid and or commercial insurance 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion from government health care programs  and imprisonment 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  created new federal crimes  including health care fraud and false statements related to health care matters 
the health care fraud statute 
table of contents prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program  including private payers 
the false statements statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items or services 
a violation of either statute is a felony and may result in fines  imprisonment and exclusion from government health care programs 
the foreign corrupt practices act of and similar worldwide anti bribery laws in non us jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
due to the breadth of some of these laws  it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws 
evolving interpretations of current laws or the adoption of new federal or state laws or regulations could adversely affect many of the arrangements we have with customers and physicians 
our risk of being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that some of these laws are broad and open to interpretation 
if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws  we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties which could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
privacy and security of health information numerous federal  state and international laws and regulations govern the collection  use  and disclosure of patient identifiable health information  or phi  including hipaa 
hipaa applies to covered entities  which include most healthcare facilities that purchase and use our products 
the hipaa privacy rule restricts the use and disclosure of phi  and requires covered entities to safeguard that information and to provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information 
the hipaa security rule establishes detailed requirements for safeguarding phi transmitted or stored electronically 
we are not a covered entity but due to activities that we perform for or on behalf of covered entities  we are sometimes deemed to be a business associate of covered entities 
in certain circumstances  the hipaa rules require covered entities to contractually bind us  as a business associate  to protect the privacy and security of phi we may encounter during activities like training customers on the use of our products or investigating product performance 
the health information technology for economic and clinical health act  or hitech  enacted in february  made significant amendments to the hipaa privacy and security rules 
most provisions of hitech were effective february   however  the new federal health data breach notice provision which requires business associates to notify covered entities of any breach of unsecured phi went into effect in september prior to february   our business was not directly subject to the hipaa privacy and security rules 
as a business associate  our privacy and security related obligations were solely contractual in nature and governed by the terms of each business associate agreement 
hitech fundamentally changed a business associate s obligations by imposing a number of hipaa privacy rule requirements and all of hipaa security rule provisions directly on business associates and making business associates directly subject to hipaa civil and criminal enforcement and the associated penalties for violation of the privacy and security rule requirements 
hitech increased civil penalty amounts for violations of hipaa by either covered entities or business associates and requires the us department of health and human services to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance 
in addition  hitech authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions in response to violations of hipaa privacy and security rules that threaten the privacy of state residents 
final implementation regulations for many of these changes have not yet been released  and due to the very recent enactment of hitech and expected final implementing regulations  we are unable to predict what the extent of the impact on our business will be 
these new hitech requirements may require us to incur additional costs and may restrict our business operations 
if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws  we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties  which could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the hipaa standards also apply to the use and disclosure of phi for research  and generally require the covered entity performing the research to obtain the written authorization of the research subject or an appropriate waiver before providing that subject s phi to sponsors like us for purposes related to the research 
these covered entities also typically impose contractual limitations on our use and disclosure of the phi they disclose to us 
we may be required to make costly system modifications to comply with the privacy and security requirements that will be imposed on us and our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business 
numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of phi  including state medical privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws 
these various laws in many cases are not preempted by the hipaa rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by the courts and government agencies  creating complex compliance issues for us and our customers and potentially exposing us to additional expense  adverse publicity and liability 
other countries also have  or are developing  laws governing the collection  use and transmission of health information and these laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business 
new standards protecting health information  whether implemented pursuant to hipaa  congressional action or otherwise  could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle health care related data  and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant 
if we do not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to the protection of health information we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions 
third party reimbursement health care providers  including hospitals  that purchase our products generally rely on third party payers  including the medicare and medicaid programs and private payers  such as indemnity insurers and managed care plans  to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the products and the procedures in which they are used 
as a result  demand for our products is dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payers 
no uniform coverage or reimbursement policy for medical technology exists among all third party payers  and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  the federal agency responsible for administering the medicare program  along with its contractors  establish coverage and reimbursement policies for the medicare program 
because a large percentage of the hospitals using our products treat elderly or disabled individuals who are medicare beneficiaries  medicare s coverage and reimbursement policies are particularly significant to our business 
in addition  private payers often follow the coverage and reimbursement policies of medicare 
we cannot assure you that government or private third party payers will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate 
in general  medicare will cover a medical product or procedure when the product or procedure is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury  or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part 
even if the medical product or procedure is considered medically necessary and coverage is available  medicare may place restrictions on the circumstances where it provides coverage 
for example  several medicare local contractors have issued policies that restrict coverage for pulse oximetry in the hospital inpatient and outpatient settings to a limited number of conditions  including limiting coverage to patients who i exhibit signs of acute respiratory dysfunction  ii have chronic lung disease  severe cardiopulmonary disease or neuromuscular disease involving the muscles of respiration  iii are under treatment with a medication with known pulmonary toxicity  or iv have sustained multiple trauma or complaints of acute chest pain 
reimbursement for our products may vary not only by the type of payer involved but also based upon the setting in which the product is furnished and utilized 
for example  medicare payment may be made  in appropriate cases  for patient stays in the hospital inpatient and outpatient settings involving the use of our products 
medicare generally reimburses hospitals based upon prospectively determined amounts 
for hospital inpatient 
table of contents stays  the prospective payment generally is determined by the patient s condition and other patient data and procedures performed during the inpatient stay  using a classification system known as medicare severity diagnosis related groups  or ms drgs 
prospective rates are adjusted for  among other things  regional differences  co morbidity  and complications 
hospitals generally do not receive separate medicare reimbursement for the specific costs of purchasing our products for use in the inpatient setting 
rather  medicare reimbursement for these costs is deemed to be included within the prospective payments made to hospitals for the inpatient services in which the products are utilized 
in contrast  some differences may be seen in the reimbursement for use of our products in hospital outpatient departments 
in this setting  medicare payments also are generally made under a prospective payment system based on the ambulatory payment classifications  or apcs  under which individual items and procedures are categorized 
hospitals receive the applicable apc payment rate for the procedure regardless of the actual cost for such treatment 
some outpatient services such as oximetry services do not receive separate reimbursement 
rather  their reimbursement is deemed packaged into the apc for an associated procedure  and the payment for that apc does not vary depending on whether the packaged procedure is performed 
some procedures also are paid through composite apcs  which are apcs that establish a payment rate that applies when a specific combination of services is provided 
since january   reimbursement for certain pulse oximetry monitoring services  including those using our products  has not been packaged  but rather may receive a separate payment when no other separately payable services are provided 
effective january   these services may be separately payable when they are the only service provided to the patient on that day  packaged if provided with certain critical care services  or reimbursed through a composite apc when provided in connection with certain other services 
because payments through the prospective payment system in both the hospital inpatient and outpatient settings are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a hospital s actual costs in furnishing care  hospitals have incentives to lower their operating costs by utilizing products that will reduce the length of inpatient stays  decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs 
we cannot be certain that a hospital will purchase our products  despite the clinical benefits and opportunity for cost savings that we believe can be derived from their use 
if hospitals cannot obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products  or the procedures in which they are used  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our success with rainbow set technologies in us care areas with reimbursable test procedures  such as hospital emergency departments  hospital procedure labs  and the physician office will largely depend on the ability of providers to receive reimbursement for such testing procedures 
effective january   the maximum rates for noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin  methemoglobin and hemoglobin testing under the medicare laboratory fee schedule were per service 
effective january   the maximum fee schedule rates for these services is per service 
while private insurance payers generally follow medicare coding and payment  we cannot be certain of this and in many cases  cannot control the coverage or payment rates that private insurance payers put in place 
in addition  the ppaca could affect future medicare payment for services involving the use of our products 
moreover  the sequestration order required by the budget control act of could reduce medicare payments for procedures using our products after january   unless congress enacts legislation to avert the order 
our success in non us markets depends largely upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from the third party payers through which health care providers are paid in those markets 
health care payment systems in non us markets vary significantly by country  and include single payer  government managed systems as well as systems in which private payers and government managed systems exist side by side 
our ability to achieve market acceptance or significant sales volume in international markets we enter will be dependent in large part on the availability of reimbursement for procedures performed using our products under health care payment systems in such markets 
there can be no assurance that reimbursement for our products  or the procedures in which our products are used  will be obtained or that such reimbursement will be adequate 

table of contents manufacturing our strategy is to manufacture products in house when it is efficient and cost effective for us to do so 
we currently manufacture internally our bedside and handheld pulse oximeters  our full line of disposable and reusable sensors and most of our patient cables 
we maintain a  square foot international organization for standardization certified manufacturing area in our facility in irvine  california  and a  square foot facility in mexicali  mexico 
we will continue to utilize third party contract manufacturers for products and subassemblies that can be more efficiently manufactured by these parties  such as our circuit boards 
we monitor our third party manufacturers and perform inspections and product tests at various steps in the manufacturing cycle to ensure compliance with our specifications 
we also do full functional testing of our circuit boards 
for raw materials  we and our contract manufacturers rely on sole source suppliers for some components  including digital signal processor chips and analog to digital converter chips 
we and our contract manufacturers have taken steps to minimize the impact of a shortage or stoppage of shipments of digital signal processor chips or analog to digital converter chips  including maintaining a safety stock of inventory and designing software that may be easily ported to another digital signal processor chip 
we believe that our sources of supply for components and raw materials are adequate 
in the event of a delay or disruption in the supply of sole source components  we believe that we and our contract manufacturers will be able to locate additional sources of these sole source components on commercially reasonable terms and without experiencing material disruption in our business or operations 
we have agreements with certain major suppliers and each agreement provides for varying terms with respect to term  termination and pricing 
the initial terms of some of these agreements have expired  however  and in each case the parties have either continued to perform under the agreement or the agreement provides for automatic renewal 
most of these agreements allow for termination upon specified notice  ranging from days to six months  to the non terminating party 
certain of these agreements with our major suppliers allow for pricing adjustments  each agreement provides for annual pricing negotiation  and one also guarantees us the most favorable pricing offered by the supplier to any of its other customers 
in march  we acquired spire semiconductor  llc and its manufacturing facility  in hudson  new hampshire 
a portion of this  square foot facility is used to manufacture advanced light emitting diodes and other advanced component level technologies 
the acquisition gives us an advanced ability to develop custom components  accelerate development cycles and optimize future product costs 
in july  we acquired phasein and assumed the lease on their  square foot facility in danderyd  sweden 
we use a portion of this facility to manufacture ultra compact mainstream and sidestream capnography and gas monitoring technologies 
the acquisition of phasein s technologies complements our breakthrough innovations for patient monitoring with a portfolio of products ranging from oem solutions for external plug in and measure capnography and gas analyzers and integrated modules to handheld capnometer devices

risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks come to fruition  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
in these circumstances  the market price of our stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our revenues we currently derive substantially all of our revenue from our masimo set platform  masimo rainbow set platform and related products 
if this technology and the related products do not continue to achieve market acceptance  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the success and market acceptance of our proprietary masimo set 
currently  our primary product offerings are based on the masimo set platform 
continued market acceptance of products incorporating masimo set will depend upon our ability to continue to provide evidence to the medical community that our products are cost effective and offer significantly improved performance compared to conventional pulse oximeters 
health care providers that currently have significant investments in competitive pulse oximetry products may be reluctant to purchase our products 
if hospitals and other health care providers do not believe our masimo set platform is cost effective  safe or more accurate or reliable than competitive pulse oximetry products  they may not buy our products in sufficient quantities to enable us to be profitable 
in addition  allegations regarding the safety and effectiveness of our products  whether or not substantiated  may impair or impede the acceptance of our products 
if we are unable to achieve additional market acceptance of our core technology or products incorporating masimo set  we will not generate significant revenue growth from the sale of our products 
some of our products  including those based on licensed rainbow technology  are in development or have been recently introduced into the market and may not achieve market acceptance  which could limit our growth and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products that have been recently introduced into the market  including  but not limited to  those based on rainbow technology  a technology that we license  may not be accepted in the market 
in september  we began our limited market release of hemoglobin  and focused on obtaining data and clinical feedback on the performance of the product in the hospital 
in october  we received fda clearance for pronto  a handheld noninvasive multi parameter testing device that uses our rainbow set technology  to provide oxygen saturation  pulse rate  perfusion index and spot checking of hemoglobin levels 
in the first quarter of  we fully launched our hemoglobin product for continuous and noninvasive monitoring in the hospital 
in january  we received fda clearance for pronto and began full market release 
in june  we initiated a full commercial release of rainbow acoustic monitoring tm after a limited market release that allowed us to evaluate the product s performance in the field 
given that certain rainbow technology products are new to the marketplace  we do not know to what degree the market will accept these products  if at all 
even if our customers recognize the benefits of our products  we cannot assure you that our customers will purchase them in quantities sufficient for us to be profitable or successful 
we will need to invest in significant sales and marketing resources to achieve market acceptance of these products with no assurance of success 
the degree of market acceptance of these products will depend on a number of factors  including perceived advantages of our products and their sales prices  perceived safety and effectiveness of our products  
table of contents reimbursement available through centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  programs for using our products  and introduction and acceptance of competing products or technologies 
in general  our recent noninvasive measurement technologies are novel products that may be considered disruptive 
these recent technologies have performance levels that we believe are acceptable for many clinical environments but may be insufficient in others 
in addition  these technologies may perform better in some patients and settings than others 
the performance of these technologies shows variability across a population that follows a standard gaussian distribution described in the accuracy specifications 
over time  we hope to reduce this variability and  if we do  we expect these recent technologies to become more useful in additional environments and to become more widely adopted 
this is the adoption pattern we have experienced historically with our previously released measurements  such as oxygen saturation  and what we expect to experience in the future with our current and future technologies 
although we will seek to reduce this variability over time  we may not be successful 
if our products do not gain market acceptance or if our customers prefer our competitors products  our potential growth would be limited  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to commercialize new products  new or improved technologies and additional applications for masimo set and our right to use rainbow technology are each limited to certain markets by our cross licensing agreement with cercacor  which may impair our growth and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in may  we spun off a newly formed entity  cercacor  and provided it rights to use masimo set to commercialize non vital signs monitoring applications while we retained the rights to masimo set to commercialize vital signs monitoring applications 
on may   we entered into a cross licensing agreement with cercacor  which has been amended several times  most recently in an amended and restated cross licensing agreement  effective january   or the cross licensing agreement 
under the cross licensing agreement  we granted cercacor an exclusive  perpetual and worldwide license  with sublicense rights  to use all masimo set owned by us  including all improvements on this technology  for the monitoring of non vital signs parameters and to develop and sell devices incorporating masimo set for monitoring non vital signs parameters in any product market in which a product is intended to be used by a patient or pharmacist rather than by a professional medical caregiver  which we refer to as the cercacor market  and a non exclusive  perpetual and worldwide license  with sublicense rights  to use all masimo set for measurement of vital signs in the cercacor market 
non vital sign measurements consist of body fluid constituents other than vital sign measurements  including  but not limited to  carbon monoxide  methemoglobin  blood glucose  hemoglobin and bilirubin 
under the cross licensing agreement  we are only permitted to sell devices utilizing masimo set for the monitoring of non vital signs parameters in markets where the product is intended to be used by a professional medical caregiver  including  but not limited to  hospital caregivers and alternate care facility caregivers  rather than by a patient or pharmacist  which we refer to as the masimo market 
accordingly  our ability to commercialize new products  new or improved technologies and additional applications for masimo set is limited 
in particular  our inability to expand beyond the masimo market may impair our growth and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
pursuant to the cross licensing agreement  we have licensed from cercacor the right to make and distribute products in the masimo market that utilize rainbow technology for the measurement of only carbon monoxide  methemoglobin  fractional arterial oxygen saturation and hemoglobin  which includes hematocrit 
as a result  the opportunity to expand the market for our products incorporating rainbow technology is limited  which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and impair our growth 

table of contents we face competition from other companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than we do 
if we do not successfully develop and commercialize enhanced or new products that remain competitive with new products or alternative technologies developed by others  we could lose revenue opportunities and customers  and our ability to grow our business would be impaired 
a number of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources  larger customer bases  larger sales forces than ours  and have established stronger reputations with target customers and built relationships with gpos that are more effective than ours 
we face substantial competition from companies developing products that compete with our masimo set platform for use with third party monitoring systems 
we also face competition from companies currently marketing pulse oximetry monitors 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances  which places our products at risk of obsolescence 
our long term success depends upon the development and successful commercialization of new products  new or improved technologies and additional applications for masimo set and licensed rainbow technology 
the research and development process is time consuming and costly and may not result in products or applications that we can successfully commercialize 
in particular  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products for applications other than arterial blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate monitoring  including respiration rate  hemoglobin  carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin monitoring 
if we do not successfully adapt our products and applications both within and outside these measurements  we could lose revenue opportunities and customers 
furthermore  one or more of our competitors may develop products that are substantially equivalent to our fda cleared products  or those of our original equipment manufacturer  or oem  partners  whereby they may be able to use our products or those of our oem partners  as predicate devices to more quickly obtain fda clearance of their competing products 
competition could result in reductions in the price of our products  fewer orders for our products  a reduction of our gross margins and a loss of our market share 
we depend on our domestic and international oem partners for a portion of our revenue 
if they do not devote sufficient resources to the promotion of products that use masimo set and licensed rainbow technology  our business would be harmed 
we are  and will continue to be  dependent upon our domestic and international oem partners for a portion of our revenue through their marketing  selling and distribution of certain of their products that incorporate masimo set and licensed rainbow technology 
although we expect that our oem partners will accept and actively market  sell and distribute products that incorporate licensed rainbow technology  they may not elect  and they have no contractual obligation  to do so 
because products that incorporate our technologies may represent a relatively small percentage of business for some of our oem partners  they may have less incentive to promote these products rather than other products that do not incorporate these technologies 
in addition  some of our oem partners offer products that compete with ours 
therefore  we cannot guarantee that our oem partners  or any company that might acquire any of our oem partners  will vigorously promote products incorporating masimo set and licensed rainbow technology  or at all 
the failure of our oem partners to successfully market  sell or distribute products incorporating these technologies  the termination of oem agreements  the loss of oem partners or the inability to enter into future oem partnership agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to maintain or develop relationships with gpos  sales of our products would decline 
our ability to sell our products to us hospitals depends  in part  on our relationships with gpos 
many existing and potential customers for our products become members of gpos 
gpos negotiate beneficial pricing arrangements and contracts  which are sometimes exclusive  with medical supply manufacturers and distributors 
these negotiated prices are made available to a gpo s affiliated hospitals and other members 
if we are not one of the providers selected by a gpo  the gpo s affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely or unlikely to purchase our products 
if a gpo has negotiated a strict sole source  market share compliance or 
table of contents bundling contract for another manufacturer s products  we may be prohibited from making sales to members of the gpo for the duration of the contractual arrangement 
for the years ended december   december  and january   shipments of our pulse oximetry products to customers that are members of gpos represented million  million and million  respectively  of our revenue from sales to us hospitals 
our failure to renew our contracts with gpos may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our sales  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if we are unable to develop new relationships with gpos  our competitive position would likely suffer and our business would be harmed 
inadequate levels of coverage or reimbursement from governmental or other third party payers for our products  or for procedures using our products  may cause our revenue to decline 
sales of our products depend in part on the reimbursement and coverage policies of governmental and private health care payers 
the ability of our health care provider customers  including hospitals  to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products  or for the procedures in which our products are used  may impact our customers purchasing decisions 
therefore  our customers inability to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products would have a material adverse effect on our business 
third party payers have adopted  and are continuing to adopt  health care policies intended to curb rising health care costs 
these policies include  among others controls on reimbursement for health care services and price controls on medical products and services  limitations on coverage and reimbursement for new medical technologies and procedures  and the introduction of managed care and prospective payment systems in which health care providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed reimbursement amount per person or per procedure 
we cannot guarantee a governmental or third party payer will reimburse  or continue to reimburse  a customer for the cost of our products 
some payers have indicated that they are not willing to reimburse for certain of our products or for the procedures in which our products are used 
for example  some insurance carriers have issued policies denying coverage for transcutaneous hemoglobin measurement on the grounds that the technology is investigational in the outpatient setting 
other payers are continuing to investigate our products to determine if they will provide reimbursement to our customers 
we are working with these payers to obtain reimbursement  but may not be successful 
these trends could lead to pressure to reduce prices for our current products and product candidates and could cause a decrease in the size of the market or a potential increase in competition that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our customers may reduce  delay or cancel purchases due to a variety of factors  such as lower hospital census levels or third party guidelines  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our customers are facing a growing level of uncertainties  such as lower overall hospital census for paying patients and the impact of that lower census on hospital budgets 
in addition  there are specific portions of our business  such as our oem customers  that  due to their capital equipment sales model  could be impacted by the ongoing economic uncertainties and the resulting constraints on hospital budgets 
these hospital budget constraints could cause our oems more difficulty in selling their large  relatively high priced multi parameter devices which  in turn  could reduce our board sales to our oem customers 
in addition  certain of our products  including our rainbow measurements such as carbon monoxide  methemoglobin and hemoglobin  are sold with upfront license fees and more complex  and therefore  more expensive sensors could be impacted by hospital budget reductions 

table of contents in addition  states and other local regulatory authorities may issue guidelines regarding the appropriate scope and use of our products from time to time 
for example  our spco monitoring devices may be subject to authorization by individual states as part of emergency medical services  or ems  scope of practice procedures 
the state of california recently categorized spco as a laboratory test and therefore outside the scope of practice for ems providers 
although a lack of inclusion into scope of practice procedures does not prohibit usage  it may limit adoption 
the loss of any large customer  or distributor  or any cancellation or delay of a significant purchase by a large customer could reduce our net sales and harm our operating results 
we also have a concentration of oem  distribution and direct customers 
if for any reason we were to lose our ability to sell to a specific group or class of customers  or through a distributor  we could experience a significant reduction in revenue  which would adversely impact our operating results 
also  we cannot provide any assurance that we will retain our current customers or groups of customers  or distributors  or that we will be able to attract and retain additional customers in the future 
for the years ended december   december  and january   we had sales through two just in time distributors  which in total represented  and of our total revenue  respectively 
the loss of any large customer or distributor could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
organizations that manufacture imitation masimo sensors and third party medical device reprocessors that reprocess our single patient use sensors and then resell them to hospitals at a cost lower than our new sensors may harm our reputation and cause our revenue to decline 
our development of a new technology designed to provide hospitals  clinicians and their patients with sensors that reflect true masimo quality and performance may not be accepted by all of our customers  which may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are aware that other organizations are manufacturing imitation masimo sensors 
in addition  we are aware that certain medical device reprocessors have been collecting our used single patient use sensors from hospitals and then reprocessing  repackaging and reselling those sensors to hospitals for other patients 
our experience with both these imitation sensors and reprocessed sensors is that they provide inferior performance  increased sensor utilization  reduced comfort and a number of monitoring problems 
notwithstanding these limitations and despite our customers acknowledged preference for genuine masimo single patient use adhesive sensors due to performance and risk of contamination  over the past two years there has been an increase in our customers awareness of these imitation sensors and reprocessing programs and some customers have indicated a willingness to consider purchasing some of their sensor requirements from these imitation manufacturers and third party reprocessors in an effort to reduce their overall operating costs 
these imitation and reprocessed sensors have led to and may continue to lead to confusion with our genuine masimo products  have reduced and may continue to reduce our revenue  and in some cases have harmed and may continue to harm our reputation  if customers conclude incorrectly that these imitation or reprocessed sensors are original masimo sensors 
in addition  we have expended a significant amount of time and expense investigating issues caused by imitation and reprocessed sensors  troubleshooting problems stemming from such sensors  educating customers about why imitation and reprocessed sensors do not perform up to our performance level and to their expectations  and enforcing our proprietary rights against the imitation manufacturers and reprocessors and under our customer contracts 
we have developed a new technology that is designed to ensure our customers get the performance they expect by using genuine masimo sensors 
this new technology has been included in sensors shipped since the fourth quarter of while most customers will not observe any difference when compared to our prior sensors  we believe this technology will help ensure that hospitals  clinicians and  ultimately  their patients  receive true masimo measurement quality and performance  and will curtail some of the harm to us that results when customers experience performance and other problems with imitation and reprocessed sensors 
as a result  although we believe that this technology will be viewed favorably by the overwhelming majority of hospitals and 
table of contents clinicians  there are no assurances that all of our customers will view it positively  which may reduce certain customer demand for our new sensors and  as a result  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time we may carry out strategic initiatives that are not viewed favorably by our customers  which may reduce demand for our products 
we expect to continue to implement new technologies and take action to protect and enforce our contractual  intellectual property and other rights 
for example  we plan to substantially expand our sales force for noninvasive hemoglobin  or sphb  in the near term 
although we believe implementing new technologies and taking these actions are  and will continue to be  in the best interest of patient care  the company and our stockholders  there are no assurances that the market will perceive their benefits or that these actions will yield favorable results for us  which may result in reduced customer demand for our products  cause our revenue to decline and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
covidien may seek to avoid paying any royalties to us after march   which would significantly reduce our royalty revenue  total revenues and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are party to a settlement agreement with covidien 
under the current settlement agreement  we earn royalties on covidien s total us based pulse oximetry sales 
for the years ended december   december  and january   our royalties from the covidien settlement agreement totaled million  million and million  respectively 
because these royalty payments do not carry any significant cost  they result in significant improvements to our reported gross profit  operating income levels and earnings per share 
as a result  an elimination of royalties that we earn under the settlement agreement in the future will have a significant impact on our revenue  gross margins  operating income and earnings per share 
on january   we entered into a second amendment to this settlement agreement with covidien 
as part of this amendment  which became effective on march   covidien agreed to pay us a royalty at a rate of of its us pulse oximetry revenue  as that term is defined in the january  second amendment  from march  through at least march  in exchange for this royalty payment  we have provided covidien with a covenant not to sue for its current pulse oximetry products  but not for any other technologies that covidien may add  pursuant to the second amendment 
after march   covidien may stop paying us any royalties  which would have a material adverse impact on our total revenue  gross margins  operating income and earnings per share 
risks related to our intellectual property if the patents we own or license  or our other intellectual property rights  do not adequately protect our technologies  we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our rights to the technologies used in our products  including masimo set and licensed rainbow technology 
we rely on patent protection  trade secrets  as well as a combination of copyright and trademark laws and nondisclosure  confidentiality and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology and rights 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or maintain any competitive advantage 
in addition  we cannot be assured that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent to us 
the us patent and trademark office  or pto  may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications  and patents issued as a result of the pending patent applications  if any  may not provide us with significant commercial protection or be issued in a form that is advantageous to us 
we could also incur substantial costs in proceedings before the pto 
our issued and licensed patents and those that may be issued or 
table of contents licensed in the future  may expire or may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related technologies 
some of our patents related to our masimo set algorithm technology began to expire in march additionally  upon expiration of other issued or licensed patents  we may lose some of our rights to exclude competitors from making  using  selling or importing products using the technology based on the expired patents 
while we seek to offset potential losses relating to important expiring patents by securing additional patents on commercially desirable improvements  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing such additional patents  or that such additional patents will adequately offset the effect of expiring patents 
we also must rely on contractual rights with the third parties that license technology to us to protect our rights in the technology licensed to us 
there is no assurance that competitors will not be able to design around our patents 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you that we can meaningfully protect all our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology 
we seek to protect our know how and other unpatented proprietary technology with confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees  our oem partners  independent distributors and consultants 
however  such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information 
in addition  we rely on the use of registered and common law trademarks with respect to the brand names of some of our products 
common law trademarks provide less protection than registered trademarks 
loss of rights in our trademarks could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if we fail to apply for intellectual property protection or if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries  our competitors may be able to compete more effectively against us  which could adversely affect our competitive position  as well as our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling certain products 
companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
we face the risk of claims that we have infringed on third parties intellectual property rights 
searching for existing intellectual property rights may not reveal important intellectual property and our competitors may also have filed for patent protection  which is not publicly available information  or claimed trademark rights that have not been revealed through our availability searches 
in addition  many of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies 
we may be subject to claims that our employees have disclosed  or that we have used  trade secrets or other proprietary information of our employees former employers 
our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third parties intellectual property rights may not always be successful 
any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us  even those without merit  could increase the cost of our products  be expensive and time consuming to defend  result in us being required to pay significant damages to third parties  force us to cease making or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  require us to redesign  reengineer or rebrand our products  product candidates and technologies  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party s intellectual property on terms that may not be favorable or acceptable to us  
table of contents require us to indemnify third parties pursuant to contracts in which we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement claims  divert the attention of our management and other key employees  result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products impacted by the claims until the claims are resolved  and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  new patents obtained by our competitors could threaten the continued commercialization of our products in the market even after they have already been introduced 
in  philips electronics north america corporation filed antitrust and patent infringement counterclaims against us  as further explained in part  item of this annual report on form k 
we believe competitors may currently be violating and may in the future violate our intellectual property rights  and we may bring additional litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  which may result in substantial expense and may divert our attention from implementing our business strategy 
we believe that the success of our business depends  in significant part  on obtaining patent protection for our products and technologies  defending our patents and preserving our trade secrets 
we were previously involved in significant litigation to protect our patent position and may be required to engage in further litigation 
in  we settled a costly  six year lawsuit against mallinckrodt  inc  part of tyco healthcare currently covidien ltd  and one of its subsidiaries  nellcor puritan bennett  inc  in which we claimed that covidien was infringing some of our pulse oximetry signal processing patents 
in february  we filed a patent infringement suit against philips electronics north america corporation and philips medizin systeme b blingen gmbh related to philips fast pulse oximetry technology and certain of philips patient monitors 
in december  we filed a patent infringement and breach of contract suit against mindray ds usa  inc and shenzhen mindray bio medical electronics co  ltd  which is an oem partner of ours 
both of these suits are described in part  item of this annual report on form k  and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
both philips electronics north america corporation and philips medizin systeme b blingen gmbh are associated with philips medical systems  another oem partner of ours 
there is no guarantee that we will prevail in either suit or receive any damages or other relief if we do prevail 
our ongoing and future litigation could result in significant additional costs and further divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and the implementation of our business strategy and may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property rights 
risks related to our regulatory environment our failure to obtain and maintain fda clearances or approvals on a timely basis  or at all  would prevent us from commercializing our current or upgraded products in the united states  which could severely harm our business 
each medical device that we wish to market in the us generally must first receive either k clearance from the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act by filing a k pre market notification  or pma  through submitting a pma application 
even if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted  
table of contents the clearance or approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed 
we cannot assure you that the fda will grant k clearance on a timely basis  if at all  for new products or uses that we propose for masimo set or licensed rainbow technology 
the fda s k clearance process of our products and uses has historically taken approximately four to six months 
however  over the past year we have experienced a significantly longer k clearance review process 
our more recent experience in seeking fda k clearance  along with information we have received from other medical device manufacturers  suggests that the fda may have modified its k review protocol and process 
specifically  it appears that the fda s medical device product reviews currently require applicants to provide much more information and data than in prior periods  the fda is not consistently relying upon prior precedents thereby leading to more review cycles or  in some cases  to non substantially equivalent decisions  and that the fda has broadened the scope of its reviews 
as a result  we have experienced lengthier fda k review periods over the past months  which has delayed the k clearance process for our products and uses over this period compared to prior periods 
in addition  in september  the fda commissioned the institute of medicine to study the premarket notification program used to review and clear certain medical devices marketed in the us in august  the fda issued its preliminary recommendations on reform of the k premarket notification process for medical devices 
on january   the fda announced its plan of action for implementing these recommendations 
the plan of action included action items  including revising existing guidance or developing guidance to clarify various aspects of the k process and to streamline the review process for innovative  lower risk products the de novo classification process  improving training for the center for devices and radiological health staff and industry  increasing reliance on external experts  and addressing and improving internal processes 
the fda has already begun implementing many of these reforms  and may implement other reforms in the future  which could have the effect of making it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain k clearance in the future 
we have received fda k clearance for the pronto and pronto for noninvasive spot checking of hemoglobin and other measurements in clinical and non clinical settings  including blood donation facilities 
before commercializing either device in us blood donation centers  we are also pursuing specific regulatory clearance from the fda center for biologics evaluation and research  which regulates the collection of blood and blood components used for transfusion or for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals derived from blood and blood components 
to date  the fda has regulated pulse oximeters incorporating masimo set and licensed rainbow technology  and our sensors  cables and other products incorporating masimo set and licensed rainbow technology for pulse oximetry under the k process 
although k clearances have been obtained for all of our current products  these clearances may be withdrawn by the fda at any time if substantial safety or effectiveness problems develop with our devices 
furthermore  our new products or significantly modified marketed products could be denied k clearance and be required to undergo the more burdensome pma process 
the process of obtaining pma is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain than the process for obtaining k clearance and generally takes one to three years  but may be longer 
the failure of our oem partners to obtain required fda clearances or approvals for products that incorporate our technologies could have a negative impact on our revenue 
our oem partners will be required to obtain their own fda clearances for products incorporating masimo set and licensed rainbow technology to market these products in the us we cannot assure you that the fda clearances we have obtained will make it easier for our oem partners to obtain clearances of products incorporating these technologies  or that the fda will ever grant clearances on a timely basis  if at all  for any future product incorporating masimo set and licensed rainbow technology that our oem partners propose to market 

table of contents if we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements  or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products  these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market 
our products  along with the manufacturing processes and promotional activities for such products  are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory bodies 
in particular  we and our suppliers are required to comply with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  which covers the methods and documentation of the design  control testing  production  component suppliers control  quality assurance  labeling control  packaging  storage and shipping of our products 
the fda enforces the qsr through announced and unannounced inspections 
we are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses 
failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with statutes and regulations administered by the fda and other regulatory bodies  discovery of previously unknown problems with our products including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  manufacturing problems  or failure to comply with regulatory requirements  or failure to adequately respond to any fda observations concerning these issues  could result in  among other things  any of the following actions warning letters or untitled letters issued by the fda  fines  civil penalties  injunctions and criminal prosecution  unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions  delays in clearing or approving  or refusal to clear or approve  our products  withdrawal or suspension of clearance or approval of our products or those of our third party suppliers by the fda or other regulatory bodies  product recall or seizure  orders for physician notification or device repair  replacement or refund  interruption of production  and operating restrictions 
furthermore  our key component suppliers may not currently be  or may not continue to be  in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
if any of these actions were to occur  it would harm our reputation and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our products abroad 
we currently market and intend to continue to market our products internationally 
outside of the us  we can market a product only if we receive a marketing authorization and  in some cases  pricing approval  from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the regulatory registration licensing process varies among international jurisdictions and may require additional testing 
the time required for international registration of new products may differ from that required for obtaining fda clearance 
the foreign registration licensing process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining fda clearance in addition to other risks 
we may not obtain foreign regulatory registration licensing on a timely basis  if at all 
fda clearance does not ensure new product registration licensing by foreign regulatory authorities 
approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by any other foreign regulatory authority or by the fda 
if we fail to receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis  or at all  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
modifications to our marketed devices may require new regulatory clearances or premarket approvals  or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified devices until clearances or approvals are obtained 
any modifications to an fda cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new k clearance or possibly a pma 
table of contents approval 
we may not be able to obtain such clearances or approvals in a timely fashion  or at all 
delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner  which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have made modifications to our devices in the past and we may make additional modifications in the future 
if the fda disagrees with our conclusion and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications  we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
federal regulatory reforms may reduce the profit we are able to earn on the sale of our products 
from time to time  legislation is drafted and introduced in congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval  manufacture and marketing of medical devices 
in addition  fda regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the fda in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products 
it is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or fda regulations  guidance or interpretations changed  and what the impact of such changes  if any  may be 
however  any changes could make it more difficult for us to maintain or attain approval to develop and commercialize our products and technologies 
if our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury  we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations  which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions  including recall of our products 
under the fda medical device reporting regulations  we are required to report to the fda any incident in which a product of ours may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which a product of ours malfunctioned and  if the malfunction were to recur  would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury 
in addition  all manufacturers placing medical devices in european union markets are legally required to report to the relevant authority in whose jurisdiction any serious or potentially serious incidents occurred involving devices produced or sold by the manufacturer 
the fda and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of our commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in  for example  design  labeling or manufacture 
in the case of the fda  the authority to require a recall generally must be based on an fda finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death 
manufacturers may  under their own initiative  recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found or we become aware of a safety issue involving a marketed product 
a government mandated or voluntary recall by us or by one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors  design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues 
we may initiate certain voluntary recalls involving our products in the future 
recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
from our inception through december   we initiated five voluntary recalls of our products  none of which was material to our operating results 
each of these recalls was reported to the fda within the appropriate regulatory timeframes 
because of our dependence upon patient and physician perceptions  any negative publicity associated with these or any future voluntary recalls could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and growth prospects 
off label promotion of our products or promotional claims deemed false or misleading could subject us to substantial penalties 
obtaining k clearance only permits us to promote our products for the uses specifically cleared by the fda 
use of a device outside its cleared or approved indications is known as off label use 
physicians may use our products off label because the fda does not restrict or regulate a physician s choice of treatment within the 
table of contents practice of medicine 
although we may request additional cleared indications for our current products  the fda may deny those requests  require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared product as a condition of clearance 
we must have adequate substantiation for our product performance claims 
if the fda determines that we or our oem partners have promoted our products for off label use or have made false or misleading or inadequately substantiated promotional claims  it could request that we or our oem partners modify those promotional materials or take regulatory or enforcement actions  including the issuance of an untitled letter  a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine and criminal penalties 
it is also possible that other federal  state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities  such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement 
in that event  we would be subject to extensive fines and penalties and our reputation could be damaged and adoption of our products would be impaired 
although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off label promotion of our products  the fda or another regulatory agency could conclude that we have engaged in off label promotion 
in addition  the off label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to patients  and  in turn  the risk of product liability claims 
product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us 
we may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state health care laws  including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws  and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with these laws 
although we do not provide health care services or receive payments directly from medicare  medicaid or other third party payers for our products or the procedures in which our products are used  health care regulation by federal and state governments will impact our business 
health care fraud and abuse laws potentially applicable to our operations include  but are not limited to the federal health care programs anti kickback law  which prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting  or receiving any bribe  kickback or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase  order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal health care program such as the medicare or medicaid programs  federal false claims laws which prohibit  among other things  knowingly and willfully presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for payment from medicare  medicaid  or other third party payers that are false or fraudulent  the federal provisions of the hipaa established federal crimes for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items or services  and state laws analogous to each of the above federal laws  such as state anti kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by non governmental third party payers  including commercial insurers  and state laws governing the privacy of certain phi 
federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for payment to third party payers that are false or fraudulent 
for example  the federal civil false claims act imposes liability on any person or entity who  among other things  knowingly and willfully presents  or causes to be presented  a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program  including medicaid and medicare 
some suits filed under the civil false claims act  known as qui tam actions  can be brought by a private individual  referred to as a whistleblower or relator  on behalf of the government and such individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement 
such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise 
in recent years  the number or suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically 
manufacturers  like us  can be held liable under false claims laws  even if they do not submit claims to the government  if they are found to have caused medical care providers to have submitted claims to the government for payment for a service or the use of a device that is not 
table of contents properly covered for government reimbursement 
a number of states also have false claims laws  and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under medicaid and or commercial insurance 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer s products from reimbursement under government programs and imprisonment 
in particular  when an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil false claims act  it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus civil penalties of  to  for each separate false claim 
as previously disclosed  in november we voluntarily notified the fda that we received allegations regarding the safety and efficacy of our pronto and pronto products from certain former sales representatives of ours 
in april  we were informed by representatives of the us department of justice  or doj  that a qui tam complaint had been filed under seal against us by certain individuals 
we cooperated fully with the government s investigation and in november  we were informed that the doj declined to intervene in the case 
although we believe that our business practices comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations  complaints filed against us and any related government investigations may involve some distraction to management and cause us to incur additional expenses 
we have certain arrangements with hospitals that may be affected by these laws 
for instance  under our standard customer arrangements  we provide hospitals with free pulse oximetry monitoring devices in exchange for their agreement to purchase future pulse oximetry sensor requirements from us 
in addition  we occasionally provide our customers with rebates in connection with their annual purchases 
while we believe that these arrangements are structured such that we are currently in compliance with applicable federal and state health care laws  one or more of these arrangements may not meet the federal anti kickback law s safe harbor requirements  which may result in increased scrutiny by government authorities that are responsible for enforcing these laws 
there can be no assurance that we will not be found to be in violation of any of such laws or other similar governmental regulations to which we are directly or indirectly subject  and as a result we may be subject to penalties  including civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  exclusion of our products from reimbursement under medicare  medicaid and other federal health care programs  and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations 
any penalties could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
any action against us for violation of these laws  even if we successfully defend against them  could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management s attention from the operation of our business 
further  we are required to comply with federal and state laws governing the transmission  security and privacy of individually identifiable phi that we may obtain or have access to in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products 
we may be required to make costly system modifications to comply with the hipaa privacy and security requirements 
our failure to comply may result in criminal and civil liability because the potential for enforcement action against business associates is greater as a result of the health information technology for economic and clinical health act 
numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of phi including state medical information privacy laws  state social security number protection laws and state and federal consumer protection laws 
in some cases  more protective state privacy and security laws are not preempted by hipaa and may be subject to interpretation by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in potentially complex compliance issues for us and our customers 
state and federal human subject protection laws apply to our receipt of individually identifiable phi in connection with clinical research 
these laws could create liability for us if one of our research collaborators uses or discloses research subject information without authorization and in violation of applicable laws 

table of contents legislative and regulatory changes in the health care industry could have a negative impact on our financial performance 
furthermore  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be significantly and adversely affected by recently enacted health care reform legislation in the us or if reform programs are adopted in our key markets 
changes in the health care industry in the us and elsewhere could adversely affect the demand for our products as well as the way in which we conduct our business 
significantly  president obama signed health care reform legislation into law that will require most individuals to have health insurance  establish new regulations on health plans create insurance pooling mechanisms and reduce medicare spending on services provided by hospitals and other providers 
additionally  this legislation imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a excise tax on us medical device sales  beginning on january  we currently estimate our medical device tax to be in the range of million to million for it is expected that this medical device tax will also impose additional compliance and reporting obligations on us  and therefore increase our general and administrative expenses going forward 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this tax on our business operations and may take none  one or several actions  in response 
if we cannot offset some or all of this additional tax  it will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the physician payment sunshine act  or the sunshine act  which was enacted by congress as part of the patient protection and affordable care act on march   requires medical device companies to track and publicly report  with limited exception  all payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals in the us implementing regulations for these tracking and reporting obligations have not been finalized  but it is anticipated that companies will be required to begin tracking payments in early and will be required to report payments to the government by march   and annually thereafter 
if we fail to comply with the data collection and reporting obligations imposed by the sunshine act  we may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties 
in addition  many details of the recently enacted health care reform legislation will be addressed in the implementing regulations 
we cannot predict the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us or what health care initiatives  if any  will be implemented at the state level 
in general  an expansion in government s role in the us health care industry may lower reimbursements for our products  reduce demand for innovative products  reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect our business and results of operations  possibly materially 
in addition  as a result of the focus on health care reform in connection with the presidential election  there is risk that congress may implement changes in laws and regulations governing health care service providers  including measures to control costs  or reductions in reimbursement levels 
furthermore  many private payers look to medicare s coverage and reimbursement policies in setting their coverage policies and reimbursement amounts such that federal reforms could influence the private sector as well 
finally  many states also may attempt to reform their medicaid programs such that either coverage for certain items or services may be narrowed or reimbursement for them could be reduced 
these health care reforms may adversely affect our business 
consistent with or in addition to congressional or state reforms  the cms  the federal agency that administers the medicare and medicaid programs  could change its current policies that affect coverage and reimbursement for our products 
cms determined in that certain uses of pulse oximetry monitoring are eligible for separate medicare payment in the hospital outpatient setting when no separately payable hospital outpatient services are reported on the same date of service 
each year  however  cms re examines the reimbursement rates for hospital inpatient and outpatient and physician office settings and could either increase or decrease the reimbursement rate for procedures utilizing our products 
we are unable to predict when legislation or regulation that affects our business may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect any such legislation or regulation would have on 
table of contents our business 
any such legislation  regulation or policies that affect the coverage and reimbursement of our current or future products  or the procedures utilizing our current or future products  could cause our sales to decrease and our revenue to decline 
in addition  the requirements or restrictions imposed on us or our products may change  either as a result of administratively adopted policies or regulations or as a result of the enactment of new laws 
our medical devices and business activities are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and other federal  state and international governmental authorities 
these authorities and members of congress have been increasing their scrutiny over the medical device industry 
in recent years  the us congress  department of justice  the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services  and the department of defense have issued subpoenas and other requests for information to medical device manufacturers  primarily related to financial arrangements with health care providers  regulatory compliance and product promotional practices 
we anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely  and any new regulations or statutory provisions could result in delays or increased costs during the period of product development  clinical trials  and regulatory review and approval  as well as increased costs to assure compliance 
further  our success in international markets also depends upon the eligibility of reimbursement for our products through government sponsored health care payment systems and other third party payers 
outside of the us  reimbursement systems vary by country 
these systems are often subject to the same pressures to curb rising health care costs and control health care expenditures as those in the us in addition  as economies of emerging markets develop  these countries may implement changes in their health care delivery and payment systems 
if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payers outside of the us are not obtained  sales of our products outside of the us may be adversely affected 
risks related to our business and operations cercacor has conducted most of the research and development of rainbow technology and we are largely dependent upon cercacor to develop improvements to certain rainbow technologies 
cercacor has conducted the substantial majority of research and development of certain rainbow technologies 
although we expect cercacor to continue its research and development activities related to certain rainbow technology and specific noninvasive monitoring measurements  including blood glucose and hemoglobin  we have no assurance that it will do so 
in the event cercacor does not continue to develop and improve selected rainbow technologies  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may experience conflicts of interest with cercacor with respect to business opportunities and other matters 
prior to our initial public offering in august  our stockholders owned of the outstanding shares of capital stock of cercacor and we believe that as of december   a number of stockholders of cercacor continued to own shares of our stock 
joe kiani  our chairman and chief executive officer  is also the chairman and chief executive officer of cercacor 
jack lasersohn  another member of our board of directors  also serves on the board of directors of cercacor 
due to the interrelated nature of cercacor with us  conflicts of interest will arise with respect to transactions involving business dealings between us and cercacor  potential acquisitions of businesses or products  development of products and technology  the sale of products  markets and other matters in which our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders may conflict with the best interests of the stockholders of cercacor 
we cannot assure you that any conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor  or that with respect to our transactions with cercacor we will negotiate terms that are as favorable to us as if such transactions were with another third party 

table of contents we will be required to pay cercacor for the right to use certain improvements to masimo set that we develop 
under the cross licensing agreement  if we develop improvements to masimo set for the noninvasive monitoring of non vital signs parameters  we would be required to assign these developments to cercacor and then license the technology back from cercacor in consideration for royalty obligations to cercacor 
therefore  any improvement to this technology would be treated as if it had been developed exclusively by cercacor 
in addition  we will not be reimbursed by cercacor for our expenses relating to the development of any such technology 
as a result of these terms  we may not generate any revenue from the further development of masimo set for the monitoring of non vital signs parameters  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to pay royalties to cercacor for all products sold that contain rainbow technology  including certain annual minimum royalty payments  and this may impact our reported gross margins if we discontinue consolidating cercacor within our financial statements 
the cross licensing agreement requires us to pay cercacor a royalty for all products that we sell which include their proprietary rainbow technology 
this includes handheld  table top and multi parameter products that incorporate licensed rainbow technology 
beginning in  for hospital contracts where we place equipment and enter into a sensor contract  we pay a royalty to cercacor on the total sensor contract revenue based on the ratio of rainbow enabled devices to total devices 
the agreement also requires that we make available to cercacor  at its request  up to of our annual board and sensor production volume at our total manufactured cost 
in addition to these specific royalty and product obligations  our cross licensing agreement requires that we pay cercacor specific annual minimum royalty payments 
currently  we are required to consolidate cercacor within our financial statements 
accordingly  the royalties that we owe to cercacor are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements presented within this annual report on form k and our other periodic reports and the gross profit margins reported in our consolidated financial results do not include the royalty expense that we pay to cercacor 
we are also obligated to include  and have included  cercacor s engineering and administrative expenses in our reported engineering and administrative expenses 
if our financial statements were not consolidated with cercacor  our reported cost of goods sold would increase and our reported engineering and administrative expenses would decrease 
to date  the amount of royalty expense has approximated the amount of engineering and administrative expense 
in the future  depending upon the success of rainbow products and the royalties earned by cercacor on those revenues  it is possible that the royalty expense will grow at a rate higher than the growth of engineering and administrative expenses 
should this occur  and if we were not required to consolidate cercacor s financial results within our financial statements  then our unconsolidated cost of sales could grow at a faster rate than our unconsolidated engineering expenses 
despite describing and reflecting this cercacor consolidation requirement within our financial statements  failure to understand or appreciate the significance of our consolidation of cercacor s financial statements may lead current and prospective investors to draw inaccurate perspectives and conclusions regarding our historical and future financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that the cross licensing agreement is terminated for any reason  or cercacor grants a license to rainbow technology to a third party  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
cercacor owns all of the proprietary rights to rainbow technology developed with our proprietary masimo set for products intended to be used in the cercacor market  and all rights for any non vital signs measurement for which we do not exercise an option pursuant to the cross licensing agreement 
in addition  cercacor has the right to terminate the cross licensing agreement or grant licenses covering rainbow technology to third parties if we breach certain terms of the agreement  including any failure to meet our minimum royalty payment obligations or failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or market products incorporating licensed rainbow technology 
if we lose our exclusive license to rainbow technology  
table of contents we would lose the ability to prevent others from making  using  selling or importing products using rainbow technology in our market 
as a result  we would likely be subject to increased competition within our market  and cercacor or competitors who obtain a license to rainbow technology from cercacor would be able to offer related products 
we may not be able to commercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow technology cost effectively or successfully 
it is generally more expensive for us to make products that incorporate rainbow technology that we license than products that do not include licensed rainbow technology  due to increased royalties that we must pay to cercacor for the licenses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sell products incorporating licensed rainbow technology at a price the market is willing to accept 
if we cannot commercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow technology successfully  we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue from these products to be profitable  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
rights provided to cercacor in the cross licensing agreement may impede a change in control of our company 
in the event we undergo a change in control  we are required to immediately pay a million fee to exercise an option to license technology developed by cercacor for use in blood glucose monitoring 
under the cross licensing agreement  a change in control includes  but is not limited to  the resignation or termination of joe kiani from his position of chief executive officer of either masimo or cercacor 
additionally  our per product royalties payable to cercacor will become subject to specified minimums  and the minimum aggregate annual royalties for all licensed rainbow measurements payable to cercacor is million for carbon monoxide  methemoglobin  fractional arterial oxygen saturation  hemoglobin and blood glucose  plus up to million per other rainbow measurements 
also  if the surviving or acquiring entity ceases to use masimo as a company name and trademark following a change in control  all rights to the masimo trademark will automatically be assigned to cercacor 
this could delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over our then current trading price 
in addition  our requirement to assign all future improvements for non vital signs to cercacor could impede a change in control of our company 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly results in the future and we may not maintain our recent profitability and changes to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules may affect how we conduct our business and affect our reported results of operations 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future 
we may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations as a result of delays or interruptions in manufacturing and shipping of our products  varying demand for and market acceptance of our technologies and products  the effect of competing technological and market developments resulting in lower selling prices or significant promotional costs  changes in the timing of product orders and the volume of sales to our oem partners  actions taken by gpos  delays in hospital conversions to our products and declines in hospital patient census  our legal expenses  particularly those related to litigation matters  changes in our product or customer mix  inability to efficiently scale operations and establish processes to accommodate business growth  
table of contents unanticipated delays or problems in the introduction of new products  including delays in obtaining clearance or approval from the fda  high levels of returns and repairs  and change in reimbursement rates for sphb  spco and spmet parameters 
if our operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels and are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenue for a particular period was below our expectations  we would not be able to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that period 
any revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative effect on our operating results for the period 
due to these and other factors  you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
in addition  a change in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices  or the interpretation of them by the sec or other regulatory bodies  can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the adoption of new rules may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
if we lose the services of our key personnel  or if we are unable to attract and retain other key personnel  we may not be able to manage our operations or meet our growth objectives 
we are highly dependent on our senior management  especially joe kiani  our chief executive officer  and other key officers 
we are also heavily dependent on our engineers and field sales team  including sales representatives and clinical specialists 
our success will depend on our ability to retain our current management  engineers and field sales team  and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future  including scientists  clinicians  engineers and other highly skilled personnel 
competition for senior management  engineers and field sales personnel is intense and we may not be able to retain our personnel 
in addition  some of our key personnel hold stock options with an exercise price that is greater than our recent closing prices  which may minimize the retention value of these options 
the loss of the services of members of our key personnel could prevent the implementation and completion of our objectives  including the development and introduction of our products 
in general  our officers may terminate their employment at any time without notice for any reason 
we carry key person life insurance on only mr 
kiani  who is also the chief executive officer of cercacor 
mr 
kiani devotes most of his time to us 
existing or future acquisitions of businesses could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses successfully into our existing operations or if we discover previously undisclosed liabilities 
we have acquired six businesses since our inception and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
successful acquisitions depend upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financing 
even if we complete acquisitions  we may experience difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel  products and other assets into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company  products or other assets  diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  
table of contents difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions  and changes in the overall financial model as certain acquired companies may have a different revenue  gross profit margin or operating expense profile 
in addition  an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize acquisition expenses and acquired assets 
we may also discover deficiencies in internal controls  data adequacy and integrity  product quality  regulatory compliance and product liabilities that we did not uncover prior to our acquisition of such businesses  which could result in us becoming subject to penalties or other liabilities 
any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected penalties or liabilities in connection with such businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our international business structure may not result in expected operational benefits 
in  we implemented a new international business structure designed to better serve and support our growing international business 
by centralizing our international operations  including sales management  marketing  customer support  planning  logistics and administrative functions  we believe we will be able to develop a more efficient and scalable international organization capable of being even more responsive to the business needs of our international customers all under one centralized management structure 
we commenced the implementation of an international business structure to align our operations with the business needs of our non us customers and we believe that we may  in the long run  also benefit from certain operational benefits and achieve a lower overall tax rate 
however  there can be no assurance that our efforts will produce any anticipated operational benefits or provide an overall lower tax rate 
realization of the expected benefits will depend on a number of factors  including our future business results and profitability  changes in us or international tax law and the geographic composition of our pre tax income 
legislative action may be taken by the us congress which  if ultimately enacted  could adversely affect our effective tax rate and or require us to take further action  at potentially significant expense  to seek to preserve our effective tax rate 
we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals 
however  if proposals were enacted that had a negative effect on our international business structure  we could be subjected to increased taxation and or potentially significant expense 
the risks inherent in operating internationally and the risks of selling and shipping our products and of purchasing our components and products internationally may adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we derive a portion of our net sales from international operations 
in each of the years ended december   december  and january    and  respectively  of our product revenue was derived from our international operations 
in addition  we purchase a portion of our raw materials and components on the international market 
the sale and shipping of our products across international borders  as well as the purchase of materials and components from international sources  subject us to extensive us and foreign governmental trade regulations 
compliance with such regulations is costly and we would be exposed to potentially significant penalties for non compliance 
any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include  but are not limited to  significant criminal  civil and administrative penalties  including imprisonment of individuals  fines and penalties  denial of export privileges  seizure of shipments  restrictions on certain business activities  and exclusion or debarment from government contracting 
also  the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping  manufacturing and sales activities 
any material decrease in our international sales would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents in addition  our international sales operations expose us and our representatives  agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions 
these risks include  but are not limited to the imposition of additional us and foreign governmental controls or regulations  the imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements  a shortage of high quality sales people and distributors  loss of any key personnel that possess proprietary knowledge  or who are otherwise important to our success in certain international markets  changes in duties and tariffs  license obligations and other non tariff barriers to trade  the imposition of new trade restrictions  the imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents  representatives and distributors  scrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines  penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us  pricing pressure that we may experience internationally  laws and business practices favoring local companies  political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts  financial and civil unrest worldwide  longer payment cycles  and difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights 
in addition  the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws in non us jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
because of the predominance of government sponsored health care systems around the world  many of our customer relationships outside of the us are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti bribery laws 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
despite our training and compliance programs  our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents 
violations of these laws  or allegations of such violations  could subject us to cash and non cash penalties  disrupt our operations  involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operations may be adversely impacted by our exposure to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates 
we market our products in certain foreign markets through our subsidiaries and other international distributors 
the related sales agreements may provide for payments in a foreign currency 
a majority of our sales and expenditures are transacted in us dollars 
we transact with foreign customers in currencies other than the us dollar 
these foreign currency revenues  when converted into us dollars  can vary depending on average exchange rates during a respective period 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency gains or losses on outstanding foreign currency denominated receivables 
when converted to us dollars  these receivables can vary depending on the monthly exchange rates at the end of the period 
certain of our foreign sales support subsidiaries transact in their respective country s local currency  which is also their functional currency 
as a result  expenses of these foreign subsidiaries when converted into us dollars can vary depending on average monthly exchange rates during a respective period 
certain intercompany transactions may give rise to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains or losses 
accordingly  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the statements of comprehensive income and 
table of contents cash flows are translated into us dollars using the average monthly exchange rate during the period 
any foreign exchange gain or loss as a result of translating the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
if we decide in the future to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward contracts  these contracts may not mitigate the potential adverse impact on our financial results due to the variability of timing and amount of payments under these contracts 
in addition  our failure to sufficiently hedge  forecast or otherwise manage such foreign currency risks properly could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently manufacture our products at several locations and any disruption in or expansion of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on our manufacturing facilities in mexicali  mexico  irvine  california  hudson  new hampshire and danderyd  sweden 
these facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial time to repair 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
earthquakes are of particular significance since some of our facilities are located in an earthquake prone area 
we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  including power loss  attacks from extremist or terrorist organizations  epidemics  communication failures  fire  floods and similar events 
in the event that one of our facilities was affected by a natural or man made disaster  we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers if we could not shift production to our other manufacturing facility 
our insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are forced to seek alternative facilities  or if we voluntarily expand one or more of our manufacturing operations to new locations  we may incur additional transition costs and we may experience a disruption in the supply of our products until the new facilities are available and operating 
we are also vulnerable to disruptions which may occur as a result of local  regional and worldwide health risks 
such disruptions may include the inability to manufacture and distribute our products due to the direct effects of illness on individuals or due to constraints on supply and distribution that may result from either voluntary or government imposed restrictions 
any disruption or delay at our manufacturing facilities and any expansion of our operations to additional locations could create operational hurdles and have an adverse impact on our ability to produce sufficient inventory of our products or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory 
in addition  any disruption  delay  transition or expansion of our manufacturing operations could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount of materials and components or materials and components of adequate quality 
we depend on sole or limited source suppliers for key materials and components of our noninvasive blood constituent patient monitoring solutions  and if we are unable to obtain these components on a timely basis  we will not be able to deliver our noninvasive blood constituent patient monitoring solutions to customers 
also  we cannot guarantee that any of the materials or components that we purchase  if available at all  will be of adequate quality 
from time to time  there are industry wide shortages of several electronic components that we use in our noninvasive blood constituent patient monitoring solutions 
we may experience delays in production of our products if we fail to identify alternate vendors for materials and components  or any parts supply is interrupted or reduced or there is a significant increase in production costs  each of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we fail to comply with the reporting obligations of the securities exchange act of and section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting  our business  results of operations and financial condition and investors confidence in us could be materially and adversely affected 
as a public company  we are required to comply with the periodic reporting obligations of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  including preparing annual reports  quarterly reports and current reports 
our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner and meet our reporting obligations in their entirety could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws and regulations of the nasdaq stock market llc  expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition  pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  as amended  or the sarbanes oxley act  we are required to evaluate and provide a management report of our systems of internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to our internal control over financial reporting 
during the course of the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting  we may identify areas requiring improvement and may be required to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review 
this could result in significant delays and costs to us and require us to divert substantial resources  including management time from other activities 
in addition  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the sarbanes oxley act 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud 
any failure to maintain the requirements of section on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which in turn could harm our business  negatively impact the trading price of our stock  and adversely affect investors confidence in our company and our ability to access capital markets for financing 
changing laws and increasingly complex corporate governance and public disclosure requirements could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  new regulations of the sec and the nasdaq stock market llc  have and will create additional compliance requirements for companies such as ours 
to maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure  we have invested  and intend to continue to invest  in reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards 
these investments have resulted in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities and may continue to do so in the future 
if product liability claims are brought against us  we could face substantial liability and costs 
the manufacture and sale of products using masimo set and licensed rainbow technology expose us to product liability claims and product recalls  including  but not limited to  those that may arise from unauthorized off label use  which is use of a device in a manner outside the measurement or measurements cleared by the fda  or malfunction of  or design flaws or manufacturing defects in  our products or the use of our products with incompatible components or systems 
any losses that we may suffer from product liability claims  and the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability of our technology and products  together with the corresponding diversion of the attention of our key employees  may subject us to significant damages and could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that our product liability insurance will be sufficient to cover any or all damages or claims 
furthermore  we may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts to protect us against any product liability claims 

table of contents we may incur environmental and personal injury liabilities related to certain hazardous materials used in our operations 
our manufacturing processes involve the use  generation and disposal of certain hazardous materials and wastes  including silicone adhesives  solder and solder paste  sealants  epoxies and various solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone  acetone and isopropyl alcohol 
as a result  we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing the use  handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes 
we may incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations 
from time to time new regulations are enacted  and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced 
we continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with environmental regulations as they are enacted 
future environmental laws may significantly affect our operations because  for instance  our manufacturing processes may be required to be altered or we may be required to use different types of materials in manufacturing our products  which may increase our manufacturing costs  detrimentally impact the performance of our products  add greater testing lead times for product introductions or have other similar effects 
in our research and manufacturing activities  we use  and our employees  may be exposed to  materials that are hazardous to human health  safety or the environment 
these materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our facility pending ultimate use and disposal 
the risk of accidental injury  including to our employees  or contamination from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any such liability could exceed our reserves 
although we maintain general liability insurance  we do not specifically insure against environmental liabilities 
if an enforcement action were to occur  our reputation and our business and financial condition may be harmed  even if we were to prevail or settle the action on terms favorable to us 
we rely significantly on information technology and any failure  inadequacy  interruption or security lapse of that technology  including any cybersecurity incidents  could harm our ability to operate our business effectively 
our ability to manage and maintain our internal reports effectively  and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning system and other information systems 
portions of our information technology systems may experience interruptions  delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with ongoing systems implementation work 
cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include  but are not limited to  malicious software  attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems  misappropriation of our confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data 
the failure of these systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems  or a breach in security or other unauthorized access of these systems  may also result in delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations  and could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure  problem or breach  all of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 
the current uncertainty in the global economy  including the continuing effects of recession or slow economic growth and the on going financial crisis in europe  have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and recession in most major economies 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of the recent recession  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  and the global housing and mortgage markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for western and emerging economies 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
these factors have led to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike 
turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our distributors  customers and suppliers  including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
the liquidity of our customers and 
table of contents suppliers may also be affected by adverse global economic conditions 
if our suppliers experience credit or liquidity problems  important sources of raw materials or manufactured goods may be affected 
if our customers liquidity and creditworthiness is negatively impacted by the condition of the economy  our ability to collect on our outstanding invoices and our collection cycles may be adversely affected 
in addition  our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region 
if economic and market conditions in the global economy weaken further  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our stock our stock price may be volatile  and your investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value 
there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities  which is often unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities 
these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our stock 
from january  to december   our closing stock price ranged from to per share 
you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them due to fluctuations in the market price of our stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects and other factors 
some specific factors  in addition to the other risk factors identified above  may have a significant effect on our stock market price  many of which we cannot control 
these include but are not limited to actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects  our announcements or our competitors announcements of new products  the public s reaction to our press releases  our other public announcements and our filings with the sec  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations or principles  changes in our growth rates or our competitors growth rates  developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors  ongoing legal proceedings  our inability to raise additional capital as needed  concerns or allegations as to the safety or efficacy of our products  changes in financial markets or general economic conditions  including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the us and abroad  sales of stock by us or members of our management team  our board of directors or certain institutional stockholders  and changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our stock  other comparable companies or our industry generally 
concentration of ownership among our existing directors  executive officers and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
as of december   our current directors and executive officers and their affiliates  in the aggregate  beneficially owned of our outstanding stock 
subject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other stockholders under delaware law  the stockholders may be able to exercise a significant influence over matters 
table of contents requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  and will have some control over our management and policies 
some of these persons or entities may have interests that are different from yours 
for example  these stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree or which are not in your best interests 
the concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of us or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could reduce the price of our stock 
in addition  these stockholders could use their voting influence to maintain our existing management and directors in office  delay or prevent changes in control of us  or support or reject other management and board proposals that are subject to stockholder approval  such as amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals of significant financing transactions 
you could experience substantial dilution of your investment as a result of subsequent exercises of our outstanding options or the grant of future equity awards by us 
as of december   an aggregate of million shares of our stock were reserved for future issuance under our three equity incentive plans  million of which were subject to options outstanding as of that date at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
to the extent outstanding options are exercised  our existing stockholders may incur dilution 
we rely heavily on equity awards to motivate current employees and to attract new employees 
the grant of future equity awards by us to our employees and other service providers may further dilute our stockholders 
future resales of our stock  including those by our insiders and a few investment funds  may cause our stock price to decline 
a significant portion of our outstanding shares are held by directors  executive officers and a few investment funds 
resale by these stockholders of a substantial number of shares  announcements of the proposed resale of substantial amounts of our stock or the perception that substantial resales may be made  could significantly reduce the market price of our stock 
some of our directors and executive officers have entered into rule b trading plans pursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our stock from time to time in the future 
generally  these sales require public filings 
actual or potential sales by these insiders  including those under a pre arranged rule b trading plan  could be interpreted by the market as an indication that the insider has lost confidence in our stock and reduce the market price of our stock 
we have registered and expect to continue to register shares reserved under our equity plans under a registration statement on form s all shares issued pursuant to a registration statement on form s can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance  subject to restrictions on our affiliates under rule if a large number of these shares are sold in the public market  the sales could reduce the trading price of our stock 
our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company  prevent attempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable 
for example  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to five million shares of blank check preferred stock 
as a result  without further stockholder approval  the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights  including voting and dividend rights  to this preferred stock 
with these rights  preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors  whereby directors serve for three year terms  with one third of the directors coming up for reelection each year 
a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest  which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors 

table of contents we are also subject to the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law 
under these provisions  if anyone becomes an interested stockholder  we may not enter into a business combination with that person for three years without special approval  which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change in control of us 
an interested stockholder means  generally  someone owning or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years  subject to certain exceptions as described in the delaware general corporation law 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under the stockholder rights plan if any person becomes the beneficial owner of or more of the outstanding shares of stock  subject to a number of exceptions set forth in the plan  all of our stockholders other than the acquiring person will receive a right to purchase shares of our stock at a price of per share 
our stockholder rights plan could discourage a takeover attempt and make an unsolicited takeover of our company more difficult 
as a result  without the approval of our board of directors  you may not have the opportunity to sell your shares to a potential acquirer of us at a premium over prevailing market prices 
this could reduce the market price of our stock 
we may elect to not declare cash dividends on our stock  may elect to only pay dividends on an infrequent or irregular basis  or we may elect to not make any additional stock repurchases  and any return on your investment may be limited to the value of our stock 
however  the payment of any future dividends or the repurchase of our stock might limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities 
our board of directors may from time to time declare  and we may pay  dividends on our outstanding shares in the manner and upon the terms and conditions provided by law 
however  we may elect to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business  rather than paying cash dividends on our stock 
any payment of cash dividends on our stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  earnings  capital requirements  financial condition  business prospects  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
in the event our board of directors declares any dividends  there is no assurance with respect to the amount  timing or frequency of any such dividends 
in february  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program  whereby we may purchase up to million shares of our common stock over a period of up to three years 
any repurchase of our common stock will be at the discretion of a committee comprised of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  and will depend on several factors including  but not limited to  results of operations  capital requirements  financial conditions  available capital from operations or other sources  and the market price of our common stock 
therefore  there is no assurance with respect to the amount  price or timing of any such repurchases 
we may elect to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business  rather than repurchasing additional outstanding shares

item legal proceedings on february   we filed a patent infringement suit against philips electronics north america corporation and philips medizin systeme b blingen gmbh related to philips fast pulse oximetry technology and certain of philips patient monitors 
the suit was brought in the us district court for the district of delaware 
two patents originally asserted in this suit  related to our measure through motion technology  were successfully enforced in our previous suit against nellcor 
on june   philips electronics north america corporation and philips medizin systeme b blingen gmbh answered our complaint and philips electronics north america corporation filed antitrust and patent infringement counterclaims against us as well as counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments of invalidity on the patents asserted by us against philips 
on july   we filed our answer denying philips counterclaims and asserting various defenses 
we also asserted counterclaims against philips for fraud  intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and for declaratory judgments of noninfringement and invalidity with respect to the patents asserted by philips against us 
philips later added a claim for infringement of one additional patent 
subsequently  the court bifurcated philips antitrust claims and its patent misuse defense  as well as stayed the discovery phase on those claims pending trial in the patent case 
on october   the court limited the number of patents to be construed to four for us and three for philips 
in addition  on october   the court denied philips motion to bifurcate and stay damages in the patent case 
in december  the court held a hearing regarding the construction of the patent claims and the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation on claim construction on february  on january   the district court judge issued a claim construction order  adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge  except with respect to one construction on one of our patents to which we had objected 
with respect to this one claim construction  the district court judge did not adopt the recommendation from the magistrate judge and adopted the construction proposed by us 
in  the parties completed expert reports  discovery on some of the patents  and summary judgment motions are currently pending before the court and no decision has been issued 
in addition  in  we asserted additional patents  and the court ordered that these patents and some of the originally asserted patents would be tried in a different phase 
discovery is currently proceeding on our patents and one philips patent which are not part of the first phase trial 
we believe that we have good and substantial defenses to the antitrust and patent infringement claims asserted by philips 
there is no guarantee that we will prevail in this suit or receive any damages or other relief if we do prevail

overview we are a global medical technology company that develops  manufactures  and markets noninvasive patient monitoring products 
our mission is to improve patient outcomes and reduce cost of care by taking noninvasive monitoring to new sites and applications 
we invented masimo set which provides the capabilities of measure through motion and low perfusion pulse oximetry to address the primary limitations of conventional pulse oximetry 
pulse oximetry is the noninvasive measurement of the oxygen saturation level of arterial blood  or the blood that delivers oxygen to the body s tissues  and pulse rate 
pulse oximetry is one of the most common measurements made in and out of hospitals around the world 
masimo set has been validated in over independent clinical studies and is the only pulse oximetry technology we are aware of that has been proven to help clinicians detect critical congenital heart disease in newborns  reduce retinopathy of prematurity in neonates  and decrease intensive care unit transfers and rapid response activations on the general floor 
our products consist of a monitor or circuit board  and a recently introduced board in cable solution  for use with our proprietary single patient use and reusable sensors and cables 
we sell our products to end users through our direct sales force and certain distributors  and also sell some of our products to our oem partners  for incorporation into their products 
as of december   we estimate that the worldwide installed base of our pulse oximeters and oem monitors that incorporate masimo set was  units  based on an estimated year field life assumption 
our installed base is the primary driver for the recurring sales of our sensors  most notably  single patient adhesive sensors 
based on industry reports  we estimate that the worldwide pulse oximetry market was over billion in  the largest component of which was the sale of sensors 
after introducing masimo set  we have continued to innovate by introducing breakthrough noninvasive measurements beyond arterial blood oxygen saturation level and pulse rate  which create new market opportunities in both the hospital and non hospital care settings 
in  we launched our masimo rainbow set platform utilizing both masimo set and licensed rainbow technology  which we believe includes the first devices cleared by the fda to noninvasively and continuously monitor multiple measurements that previously required invasive or complicated procedures 
also  in  we launched noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin  or spco  allowing measurement of carbon monoxide levels in the blood 
carbon monoxide is the most common cause of poisoning in the world 
in  we launched noninvasive methemoglobin  or spmet  allowing for the measurement of methemoglobin levels in the blood 
methemoglobin in the blood leads to a dangerous condition known as methemoglobinemia  which occurs as a reaction to some common drugs used in hospitals and outpatient procedures 
in  we launched masimo pvi 
fluid administration is critical to optimizing fluid status in surgery and critical care  but traditional invasive methods to guide fluid administration often fail to predict fluid responsiveness and newer methods are complicated and costly 
in march  we debuted noninvasive hemoglobin  or sphb  and in march  we began full market release of sphb 
hemoglobin is the oxygen carrying component of red blood cells  and is one of the most frequent invasive laboratory measurements in the world  often measured as part of a complete blood count 
a low hemoglobin status is called anemia  which is generally caused by bleeding or the inability of the body to produce red blood cells 
in june  we began a full commercial release of continuous and noninvasive monitoring of respiration rate  or rra tm  via rainbow acoustic monitoring tm 
respiration rate is the number of breaths per minute 
a low respiration rate is indicative of respiratory depression and high respiration rate is indicative of patient distress 
traditional methods used to measure respiration rate are often considered inaccurate or are not tolerated well by patients 
in october  we debuted the halo index tm  which 
table of contents allows continuous global trending and assessment of multiple physiological measurements of a patient with a single number displayed on the patient safetynet tm screen 
halo index tm is pending fda k clearance 
in july  we began selling the sedline monitor  which measures the brain s electrical activity and provides information about a patient s response to anesthesia 
in january  we received fda clearance for the pronto  a product designed specifically for spot checking hemoglobin  along with oxygen saturation and pulse rate 
in december  we released ispo  a pulse oximeter cable and sensor with measure through motion and low perfusion masimo set technology for use with an iphone  ipad or ipod touch 
we also offer a remote monitoring and clinician notification solution called patient safetynet tm  which includes our which includes our masimo set or rainbow set monitors at the patient s bedside along with a central assignment station and wired or wireless server 
patient safetynet tm wirelessly notifies clinicians who are taking care of multiple patients in different rooms when one of their patients has an alarm  allowing them to intervene sooner and provide potentially life saving support 
we offer masimo set and rainbow set through our oems and our own end user products  including the radical  rad  rad tm  pronto  pronto  rad  rad  and rad v tm 
our solutions and related products are based upon our proprietary masimo set and rainbow algorithms 
this software based technology is incorporated into a variety of product platforms depending on our customers specifications 
our technology is supported by a substantial intellectual property portfolio that we have built through internal development and  to a lesser extent  acquisitions and license agreements 
as of december   we had issued and pending patents worldwide 
we have exclusively licensed from our development partner  cercacor  the right to oem rainbow technology and incorporate rainbow technology into our products intended to be used by professional caregivers  including  but not limited to  hospital caregivers and alternate care facility caregivers 
antitrust litigation proceeds during the year ended january   we completed negotiations to resolve the merits of our antitrust litigation with covidien 
as a result  we retained a total of million from two payments from covidien following the ninth circuit court of appeals october affirmance of a federal district court decision that tyco healthcare  now covidien  violated the antitrust laws through anticompetitive business practices related to the sale of its pulse oximetry products 
the gross payment amount from covidien was million  but excluding reimbursement of legal fees  costs and interest  the net amount was million 
of this amount  we retained million and the remainder was paid to the law firm that handled the trial for us 
subsequently  we received a second payment of million from covidien that related to our appeal attorneys fees and related expenses 
of this second amount  we retained million  with the remainder paid to our attorneys 
dividend payments our board of directors continuously evaluates a variety of options to return value to shareholders  including acquisition opportunities  stock buy back programs and dividends 
in and  after considering all available options at those times  the board concluded that the best and most direct way to reward shareholders for their continued investment and confidence in masimo was through the declaration of cash dividends 
in february  the board declared a special dividend of per share  or million  which was paid in march in november  the board declared a second special dividend of per share  or million  which was paid in december in october  the board declared another special dividend of per share  or million  which was paid out on december  to stockholders of record as of the close of business on november  both the and special dividends represented only a portion of our cash reserves  which the board believed was sufficient to cover our current operational needs  and to fund continued research and development investments and current strategic initiatives 
stock repurchase program in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of common stock under a repurchase program  which terminated pursuant to its terms in april the stock repurchase program 
table of contents was carried out at the discretion of a committee comprised of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer through open market purchases under a rule b trading plan 
we paid for these repurchases with available cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended december   million shares were repurchased  at an average price of per share  totaling million 
during the year ended december   million shares were repurchased  at an average price of per share  totaling million  which completed the stock repurchase program 
cercacor cercacor is an independent entity spun off from us to our stockholders in joe kiani and jack lasersohn  members of our board of directors  are also members of the board of directors of cercacor 
joe kiani  our chairman and chief executive officer  is also the chairman and chief executive officer of cercacor 
we are a party to a cross licensing agreement with cercacor  or the cross licensing agreement  which was amended and restated effective january   that governs each party s rights to certain intellectual property held by the two companies 
under the cross licensing agreement  we granted cercacor an exclusive  perpetual and worldwide license  with sublicense rights to use all masimo set owned by us  including all improvements on this technology  for the monitoring of non vital signs measurements and to develop and sell devices incorporating masimo set for monitoring non vital signs measurements in any product market in which a product is intended to be used by a patient or pharmacist  which we refer to as the cercacor market  rather than a professional medical caregiver 
we also granted cercacor a non exclusive  perpetual and worldwide license  with sublicense rights to use all masimo set for the measurement of vital signs in the cercacor market 
we exclusively license from cercacor the right to make and distribute products in the professional medical caregiver markets  referred to as the masimo market  that utilize rainbow technology for the measurement of carbon monoxide  methemoglobin  fractional arterial oxygen saturation and hemoglobin  which includes hematocrit 
to date  we have developed and commercially released devices that measure carbon monoxide  methemoglobin and hemoglobin using licensed rainbow technology 
we also have the option to obtain exclusive licenses to make and distribute products that utilize rainbow technology for the monitoring of other non vital signs measurements  including blood glucose  in product markets where the product is intended to be used by a professional medical caregiver 
in february  in order to accelerate the product development of an improved hemoglobin spot check measurement device  pronto  we agreed to fund additional cercacor s engineering expenses 
specifically  these expenses included third party engineering materials and supplies expense  as well as of total cercacor s engineering and engineering related payroll expenses from april through june  the original anticipated completion date of this product development effort 
since july  cercacor has continued to assist us with product development efforts and charged us accordingly 
beginning in  due to a revised estimate of the support required by us to complete the various pronto related projects  our board of directors approved an increase in the percentage of cercacor s total engineering and engineering related payroll expenses funded by us from to 
during the year ended december   and until both parties agree to end these services  cercacor has and will continue to assist us with continuing productization efforts of the new handheld noninvasive multi parameter testing device  that provides spot check hemoglobin testing 
during the year ended december   the total expenses for these additional services  material and supplies totaled million 
pursuant to authoritative accounting guidance  cercacor is consolidated within our financial statements for all periods presented 
this determination is based on our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact cercacor s economic performance  and our obligation to absorb cercacor s expected losses 
for the foreseeable future  we anticipate that we will continue to consolidate cercacor pursuant to the current authoritative accounting guidance  however  in the event that cercacor is no longer considered a variable interest entity  or vie  or in the event that we are no longer the primary beneficiary of cercacor  we may discontinue consolidating the entity 
for additional discussion of cercacor  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents sedline  inc sedline  inc  or sedline  a privately held entity that was formed in the fourth quarter of  is a company that designs  manufactures  markets and sells brain function monitoring technology into the hospital marketplace 
during  we made loans to sedline totaling million 
these loans carried an interest rate of and could be converted into equity upon certain predetermined conditions 
concurrently with the loans  we entered into a merger agreement with sedline  whereby we could acquire sedline at certain predetermined valuations 
pursuant to authoritative accounting guidance  it was determined that sedline was a vie and that we were the primary beneficiary during and the first six months of as a result  beginning in december  we were required to consolidate sedline s assets  liabilities and equity as a vie 
on july   upon conversion of our million note receivable and the related accrued interest due from sedline into of the authorized common stock of sedline  sedline became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
for additional discussion of sedline  see note to the consolidated financial statements

non operating income was  for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended january  this decrease of million was primarily due to realized and unrealized net losses on foreign currency denominated transactions of million recognized during the year ended december  compared to net gains of million recognized during the year ended january  the realized and unrealized net losses on foreign currency denominated transactions recognized during the year ended december  resulted primarily from losses due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro  the british pound  the canadian dollar and the australian dollar  offset by gains due to the weakening of the us dollar against the japanese yen 
the realized and unrealized net gains on foreign currency denominated transactions recognized during the year ended january  resulted primarily from gains due to the weakening of the us dollar against the japanese yen  partially offset by the losses due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended january  our effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended january  this decrease in tax provision and effective tax rate was due primarily to the effect of electing the california single sales factor method for state apportionment  the change in geographic composition of pre tax income in jurisdictions in which we do business and the decrease in uncertain tax liabilities as a result of an expiring statute of limitations 
our future effective income tax rate will depend on various factors  including profits losses before taxes  changes to tax law  and the geographic composition of pre tax income 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  of which million was invested in us treasury bills  million was in money market accounts with major financial institutions and million was in checking accounts 
these us treasury bills are classified as cash equivalents since they 
table of contents are highly liquid investments  with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase 
we carry cash equivalents at cost which approximates fair value 
as of december   we have cash totaling million held outside of the us a substantial portion of this cash held offshore is accessible without a significant tax cost 
in managing our day to day liquidity and our capital structure  we do not rely on foreign earnings as a source of funds 
we currently have sufficient funds for domestic operations and do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds associated with our permanently reinvested foreign earnings 
in the event funds that are treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated  we may be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes to repatriate these funds 
in  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  in cash receipts from covidien for royalties pursuant to our settlement agreement 
through march   we received a royalty payment based on a rate of of covidien s us pulse oximetry sales 
on january   we entered into a second amendment to the settlement agreement with covidien 
as part of this amendment  which became effective as of march   covidien agreed to pay us a royalty of for its us pulse oximetry revenue  as specifically defined in that second amendment  generated at least through march  in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of common stock under a repurchase program 
during the year ended december   million shares were repurchased  at an average price of per share  totaling million 
during the year ended december   million shares were repurchased  at an average price of per share  totaling million  which completed the stock repurchase program 
we paid for these repurchases with available cash and cash equivalents 
in october  our board declared a special per share cash dividend  payable in december  which totaled million 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in the source of cash consists primarily of net income including noncontrolling interests of million  and non cash expense for share based compensation and depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively 
in addition  accrued compensation increased million primarily due to higher staffing levels 
these sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million due to growth of our business  and an increase in benefit from deferred income taxes of million due to timing differences of taxable income 
cash provided by operating activities was million in the source of cash consists primarily of net income including noncontrolling interests of million  resulting from continued growth of our business 
also  non cash expense for share based compensation and depreciation and amortization were million and million  respectively  in in addition  accounts payable increased million due to continued growth of our business and inventory purchases in anticipation of future demand for our products  and royalties receivable decreased by million due to the decline in the royalty rate from covidien 
these sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million due to the growth of our business  and an increase in deferred cost of goods sold of million due to shipments of equipment to customers pursuant to long term sensor contracts 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities for was million primarily due to payments totaling million for the acquisitions of phasein and the spire semiconductor assets  net of cash acquired and excess liabilities assumed 
additionally  million was used for purchases of property and equipment to primarily support our manufacturing operations 
cash used in investing activities for was million primarily consisting of million of cash to purchase property and equipment to support our manufacturing operations 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash used in financing activities for was million primarily due to million of dividend payments and million in common stock repurchases 
cash used in financing activities for was million resulting from million in common stock repurchases and partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options 

table of contents future liquidity needs 
in the future  in addition to funding our working capital requirements  we anticipate our primary use of cash to be the equipment that we provide to hospitals under our long term sensor purchase agreements 
we anticipate additional capital purchases related to expanding our worldwide international operations including manufacturing  sales  marketing and other areas of necessary infrastructure growth 
our focus on international expansion will also require both continuing and incremental investments in facilities and infrastructure in the americas  europe and asia 
we also anticipate possible uses of cash for the acquisition of technologies or the acquisition of technology companies 
the amount and timing of our actual investing activities will vary significantly depending on numerous factors  such as the progress of our product development efforts  our timetable for international sales operations and manufacturing expansion  both domestic and international regulatory requirements and opportunities to acquire technologies and technology companies at prices we believe are favorable 
in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
this stock repurchase program may be carried out through open market purchases  block trades  one or more trading plans adopted in accordance with rule b of the sec  and in privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchase program will become effective in february and is expected to continue for a period of up to months unless it is terminated earlier by our board of directors 
in the event that we repurchase shares of stock  these repurchases will be subject to the availability of stock  general market conditions  the trading price of the stock  available capital  alternative uses for capital and our financial performance 
additionally  we expect to fund any potential stock repurchases through our available cash  future cash from operations  or other potential sources of capital 
despite these possible capital investment requirements and any potential stock repurchases or dividend payments  we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and operations for at least the next months 
current financing arrangements 
as of december   other than capital leases  we did not have any other long term borrowings 
the capital lease amounts represent principal and interest due on leased office equipment 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our cash liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than year years years more than years total operating leases capital leases including interest purchase commitments total contractual obligations facility  equipment and automobile leases 
leased office equipment 
certain inventory items under non cancellable purchase orders 
other obligation as of december   the liability for uncertain tax positions  including interest  was million 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amounts and periods in which these liabilities might be made 

table of contents in addition to these contractual obligations  we had the following annual minimum royalty commitments to cercacor  as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year years years more than years minimum royalty commitment to cercacor subsequent to  the royalty arrangement requires a million minimum annual royalty payment unless the agreement is amended  restated or terminated 
cercacor is consolidated within our financial statements for all periods presented 
accordingly  all intercompany royalties  option and license fees and other charges between us and cercacor have been eliminated in the consolidation 
for additional discussion of cercacor  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
critical accounting estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses for each reporting period 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and form the basis for making management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
inventory reserves for excess or obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using a standard cost method  which approximates fifo first in  first out 
inventory valuation reserves are recorded for materials that have become obsolete or are no longer used in current production and for inventory that has a market value less than the carrying value in inventory 
we generally purchase raw materials in quantities that we anticipate will be fully used within one year 
however  changes in operating strategy and customer demand  and frequent unpredictable fluctuations in market values for such materials can limit our ability to effectively utilize all of the raw materials purchased and sold through resulting finished goods to customers for a profit 
we regularly monitor potential inventory excess  obsolescence and lower market values compared to standard costs and  when necessary  reduce the carrying amount of our inventory to its market value 
we develop our inventory reserve based on an evaluation of the expected future use of our inventory on an item by item basis 
we apply historical obsolescence rates to estimate the loss on inventory expected to have a recovery value below cost 
our historical obsolescence rates are developed from our company specific experience for major categories of inventory  which are then applied to excess inventory on an item by item basis 
we also develop other specific inventory reserves when we become aware of other unique events that result in a known recovery value below cost 
for inventory items that have been written down  either due to the inventory reserve analysis or due to a specific event  the reduced value becomes the new cost basis 
the new cost 
table of contents basis of an inventory item is not marked up in subsequent periods 
our inventory reserve was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
if our estimates for potential inventory losses prove to be too low  then our future earnings will be affected when the related additional inventory losses are recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net estimated realizable value 
we rely on prior experience to estimate the amount that we expect to collect on the gross receivables outstanding  which cannot be known with exact certainty as of the time of issuance of this report 
we maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to customer liquidity issues 
we also maintain a general allowance for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate an inability  but may be unable  to pay 
although such losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past  especially given the recent deterioration of the credit markets of the worldwide economy 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in our receivable collections and additional allowances may be required 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted an accounting standard for share based compensation using the prospective method  which requires us to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
to calculate the fair value of stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately be forfeited prior to meeting their vesting requirements 
pursuant to the prospective transition method  stock options granted prior to january  continue to be accounted for under the prior existing guidance for stock issued to employees 
we estimate the length of time in which stock options are expected to be outstanding based on both our specific historical option exercise experience  as well as expected term information available from a peer group of companies with a similar vesting schedule 
the estimated volatility is based on historical and implied volatilities of our share price and historical and implied volatilities of a peer group of companies over the expected term of the option 
as we obtain more historical data as a publicly traded company  we expect to rely increasingly on our specific information for our estimate of volatility 
we are required to develop an estimate of the number of stock options that will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on our reported share based compensation  as we recognize the cumulative effect of the rate adjustments for all expense amortization in the period the estimated forfeiture rates were adjusted 
we estimate and adjust forfeiture rates based on a periodic review of recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover 
adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates could also cause changes in the amount of expense that we recognize in future periods 
share based compensation expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and january  the fair market value of our stock may also increase the cost of future stock option grants 
to the extent that the fair market value of our stock increases  the overall cost of granting these options will also increase 
for further details regarding our share based compensation see note of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition and deferred revenue we follow the current authoritative guidance for revenue recognition 
based on these requirements  we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we enter into agreements to sell pulse oximetry and related products and services as well as multiple deliverable arrangements that include various combinations of products and services 
while the majority of our sales transactions contain standard business terms and conditions  there are some transactions that contain non standard business terms and conditions 
as a result  contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including a whether an arrangement exists  b how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables if there are multiple deliverables  c when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  and d whether undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
changes in judgments on these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing of revenue recognition 
in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  amended the accounting standards related to revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on relative selling prices 
the fasb also amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to exclude software that is contained in a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible product s functionality 
we adopted these new standards on a prospective basis 
therefore  the new standards apply only to revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning january  for revenue arrangements that were entered into or materially modified after the adoption of these standards  implementation of this new authoritative guidance had no significant impact on our reported revenue during either the year ended december   as compared to revenue if the related arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  were subject to the accounting requirements in effect in the prior year 
the new standards establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price  or tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price  or esp 
vsoe of fair value is defined as the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
vsoe generally exists only when the deliverable is sold separately and is the price actually charged for that deliverable 
tpe generally does not exist for the majority of our products because of their uniqueness 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product was sold on a stand alone basis 
in the absence of vsoe and tpe  we determine esp for our products by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  features and functionality of the product  geographies  type of customer  contractual prices pursuant to gpo contracts  our pricing and discount practices and market conditions 
a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
most of our products in a multiple deliverable arrangement qualify as separate units of accounting 
in the case of our monitoring equipment products containing embedded masimo set software  we have determined that the hardware and software components function together to deliver the products essential functionality  and therefore  represent a single deliverable 
in accordance with the new guidance  the revenue from the sale of these products no longer falls within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
software deliverables  such as rainbow parameter software  which do not function together with hardware components to provide the products essential functionality  continue to be accounted for under software revenue recognition guidance 
our multiple deliverable arrangements may therefore have software deliverables that are subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance 
the revenue for these multiple element arrangements is allocated to the software deliverables and the non software deliverables based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the hierarchy in the new revenue recognition accounting guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our sales under long term sensor purchase contracts are generally structured such that we agree to provide up front and at no initial charge certain monitoring equipment  software  installation  training and ongoing warranty support in exchange for the hospital s agreement to purchase sensors over the term of the agreement  which 
table of contents ranges from three to six years 
the sensors are essential to the functionality of the monitoring equipment and  therefore  represent a substantive performance obligation 
we do not recognize any revenue when the monitoring and related equipment and software is delivered to the hospitals and installation and training is complete 
we recognize revenue for these delivered elements  on a pro rata basis  as the sensors are delivered under the long term purchase commitment 
the adoption of the new guidance for revenue recognition did not change this pattern of revenue recognition for long term sensor purchase contracts 
the cost of the monitoring equipment initially placed at the hospitals is deferred and amortized to cost of goods sold over the life of the underlying long term sensor purchase contract 
to the extent that the allocation of revenue to multiple deliverables under long term sensor agreements depends on our estimated selling prices  there is uncertainty over the percentage allocation to equipment  sensors and software 
a change in the factors we use to estimate selling price  the weighting we assign to different factors  or a change in our pricing and discounting strategy could result in a different allocation to the deliverables in an arrangement 
however  because we recognize revenue as sensors are delivered over the term of the agreement  the total revenue recognized under long term sensor agreements in any period is not dependent on the allocation to the deliverables 
the total amount of revenue recognized under long term sensor agreements in a period is dependent on the amount of sensors shipped in the period 
our long term sensor agreements provide for a minimum annual purchase commitment by our customers  but the timing and amount of customer purchases may vary from period to period 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expenses and assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
at december   we have million of net operating loss carryforwards from our subsidiary in sweden  which will carryforward indefinitely 
we believe that it is more likely than not  that million of such losses will not be realized 
a valuation allowance has been provided on such loss carryforwards 
we also have million of net operating losses from various states  which will begin to expire in  all of which will be recorded in equity when realized 
we have state research and development credits of million which will carryforward indefinitely 
additionally  we have million of investment tax credit on research and development expenditures from its operations in canada which will begin to expire in we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
in making this determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performances 
our consolidated income tax provision or benefit and the net deferred tax assets include cercacor s income taxes provision or benefit and deferred tax assets 
for income tax purposes  cercacor is not a member of our consolidated group and files its separate federal and california income tax returns 
on january   we adopted an accounting standard which prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
as of december  and december   the balance 
table of contents of gross unrecognized tax benefits was million and million  respectively 
the amount of unrecognized benefits which  if ultimately recognized  could favorably affect the tax rate in a future period was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
both amounts are net of any federal and or state benefits 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in various jurisdictions may change in the next months due to the expiration of statutes of limitation or audit settlements 
however  due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of such events  an estimate of the change within the next months cannot be made 
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense 
at december   we had accrued million for the payment of interest 
we conduct business in multiple jurisdictions  and as a result  one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the us federal  various state  local and foreign jurisdictions 
we have concluded on all us federal income tax matters for years through all material state  local and foreign income tax matters have been concluded for years through recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 or asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  then a quantitative impairment test that exists under current authoritative accounting guidance must be completed 
otherwise  the quantitative impairment test is not required 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption of this update is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks that may arise from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange fluctuations and inflation 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and on the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to our various outstanding debt instruments 
our risk associated with fluctuation in interest expense is limited to our outstanding capital lease arrangements  which have fixed interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
our investment portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with an original maturity from the date of purchase of three months or less  that have historically been held to maturity 
therefore  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december  declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income and expense while increases in interest rates will increase our interest income and expense 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a majority of our assets and liabilities are maintained in the united states in us dollars and a majority of our sales and expenditures are transacted in us dollars 
however  we transact with foreign customers in currencies other than the us dollar 
these foreign currency revenues  when converted into us dollars  can vary depending on average exchange rates during a respective period 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign currency gains or losses on outstanding foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
realized and unrealized foreign currency gains or losses on these transactions are included in our statements of comprehensive income as 
table of contents incurred 
certain of our foreign sales support subsidiaries transact in their respective country s local currency  which is also their functional currency 
as a result  expenses of these foreign subsidiaries when converted into us dollars can vary depending on average monthly exchange rates during a respective period 
certain intercompany transactions may give rise to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains or losses 
these foreign currency gains or losses are included in our statements of comprehensive income as incurred 
in addition  any other transactions between us or our subsidiaries and a third party  denominated in a currency different from the functional currency  are a foreign currency transaction 
realized and unrealized foreign currency gains or losses on these transactions are included in our statements of comprehensive income as incurred and are converted to us dollars at average exchange rates for a respective period 
the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the statements of comprehensive income and cash flows are translated into us dollars using the average monthly exchange rate during the period 
any foreign exchange gain or loss as a result of translating the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the us dollar is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
our primary foreign currency exchange rate exposures are with the euro  the japanese yen  the canadian dollar  the british pound and the australian dollar against the us dollar 
foreign currency exchange rates have experienced significant movements recently and may continue in the future 
we currently do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of a change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material effect on our future operating results or cash flows  depending on which foreign currency exchange rates change and depending on the directional change either a strengthening or weakening against the us dollar 
as our foreign operations continue to grow  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may become more significant 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations during the periods presented 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
