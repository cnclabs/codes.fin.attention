industry trends political advertising increases in even numbered years  such as  due to the advertising expenditures from candidates running in local and national elections and issue related advertiser spending 
in addition  political revenue has consistently risen between presidential election or mid term election years such as from to or from to  respectively 
in every fourth year  such as  political advertising is usually elevated further due to presidential elections  the fcc has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi channel broadcasts 
the fcc must carry rules only apply to a station s primary digital stream  retransmission consent rules provide a mechanism for broadcasters to seek payment from mvpds who carry broadcasters signals 
recognition of the value of the programming content provided by broadcasters  including local news and other programming and network programming all in hd has generated increased local revenues  we  as well as a number of other broadcasters  have joined and worked together in organizations such as the nab along with omvc now merged  m and the mcv to focus on efforts to accelerate the nationwide availability of mobile dtv and other advanced digital distribution services and work through the many programming  advertising  distribution and aggregation opportunities 
there is potential for broadcasters to create an additional revenue stream by providing their signals to a wide variety of mobile portable devices tablets  laptops  smartphones  etc 
as well as through other multi channel multi platform initiatives  automotive related advertising is a significant portion of our total net revenues in all periods presented and these revenues trended downward in most of due to the economic turmoil 
however  this sector has dramatically trended upward in the past few years due to improved economic conditions  many broadcasters are enhancing upgrading their websites to use the internet to deliver rich media content  such as newscasts and weather updates  to attract advertisers and to compete with other internet sites and smart phone and tablet device applications  seasonal advertising increases occur in the second and fourth quarters due to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers  broadcasters have found ways to increase returns on their news programming initiatives while continuing to maintain 
table of contents locally produced content through the use of news sharing arrangements  station outsourcing arrangements are becoming more common as broadcasters seek out ways to improve revenues and margins  advertising revenue related to the olympics occurs in even numbered years and the super bowl is aired on a different network each year 
both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues  and compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has halted 
networks now require compensation from broadcasters for the use of network programming 
sources of revenues and costs our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from political advertisers 
we also generate local revenues from our retransmission consent agreements with mvpds 
our revenues from local advertisers have seen a continued upward trend  with the exception of and when non political revenues fell due to the economic recession 
revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of total broadcast revenues 
we believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues  combined with a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and an increase in the number of competitive media outlets providing national advertisers multiple alternatives in which to advertise their goods or services 
our efforts to mitigate the effect of these increasingly competitive media outlets for national advertisers include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies to sell traditional and non traditional services to our advertisers including the success of multi channel digital initiatives together with mobile dtv 
in addition  our revenue success is dependent on the success and advertising spending levels of the automotive industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  program contract costs  intangible assets  income taxes  property and equipment  and investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of goodwill  long lived assets  intangible assets and equity and cost method investments 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  broadcast licenses  long lived assets  intangible assets and equity and cost method investments for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operating performance of our stations  legal factors and other various qualitative factors 
we have determined our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with the accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires such assets along with our goodwill to be tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often when certain triggering events occur 
as of december   we had  million of goodwill  million in broadcast licenses  and million in definite lived intangibles 
we perform our annual impairment tests for goodwill and broadcast licenses at the beginning of the fourth quarter each year 
in  we early adopted the accounting guidance related to the annual goodwill impairment assessment  which allowed us  to first qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that goodwill has been impaired 
as part of our qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment  we consider the following factors related to the reporting units  where applicable significant changes in the macroeconomic conditions  significant changes in the regulatory environment  
table of contents significant changes in the operating model  management  products and services  customer base  cost structure and or margin trends  comparison of current and prior year operating performance and forecast trends for future operating performance  and the excess of the fair value over carrying value of the reporting units determined in prior quantitative assessments 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired  we will apply the quantitative two step method for goodwill 
prior to  the annual impairment test for goodwill was performed using the quantitative two step method  for all reporting units 
our quantitative assessment for our goodwill consists of estimating the fair value of our reporting units  using a combination of a market approach  using recent comparable market transactions and estimated market multiples  and an income approach  using a discounted cash flow model 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units to test our goodwill for impairment consist of discount rates  revenue and expense growth rates and comparable business multiples 
the projected growth rates are based on our internal forecast of future performance  historical trends  and projected long range inflation and long term industry projections 
the discount rate is based on a number of factors including market interest rates  a weighted average cost of capital analysis based on the target capital structure for a television station  and includes adjustments for market risk and company specific risk 
for goodwill  if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  we then perform the second step which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill to determine the implied fair value 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
we early adopted the recent accounting guidance related to the annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test  which allowed us  beginning with our indefinite lived intangible impairment test  to first qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset has been impaired 
as part of our qualitative assessment for indefinite lived intangible assets  we consider the following factors related to the indefinite lived intangible asset  where applicable significant changes in cost factors that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  significant changes in the legal or regulatory environment  significant changes in management  key personnel  strategy or customers that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  significant changes in the industry and or market  significant changes in macroeconomic conditions  comparison of current and prior year operating performance and forecast trends for future operating performance  and the excess of the fair value over carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible assets determined in prior quantitative assessments 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  we will calculate the fair market value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and compare to the book value 
prior to  the annual impairment test for our indefinite lived intangibles  broadcast licenses  involved a quantitative assessment in which we estimated the fair market value of our broadcast licenses and compared to the book value 
we estimated the fair market value of our broadcast licenses using a discounted cash flow model 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our broadcast licenses consist of discount rates  normalized market share  normalized profit margin  expected future growth rates and estimated start up costs 
we then compared the estimated fair market value to the book value of these assets to determine if impairment exists 
for the broadcast licenses  if the fair value is less than book value  we would record the resulting impairment 
we aggregate our stations by market for purposes of our goodwill and license impairment testing and we believe that our markets are most representative of our broadcast reporting units because segment management views  manages and evaluates our stations on a market basis 
furthermore  in our markets where we operate or provide services to more than one station  certain costs of operating the stations are shared including the use of buildings and equipment  the sales force and administrative personnel 
our discounted cash flow model is based on our judgment of future market conditions within each designated marketing area  as well as discount rates that would be used by market participants in an arms length transaction 
based on the results of our annual qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment performed in  we concluded that we would need to perform a quantitative step test for three of our markets which had aggregate goodwill of million as of october   the date of our annual impairment test 
these markets had a decrease in operating results for the past few years and therefore  we estimated the fair value of these reporting units based on a market approach and income approach 
for all three markets  the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the respective carrying value by more than 
for all our other reporting 
table of contents units  we concluded based on the qualitative assessment that it was more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units would sufficiently exceed their carrying values and it was not necessary to perform the quantitative two step method 
for the year ended december   an increase in our discount rate and or a decrease in our multiple of would not result in goodwill impairment 
based on the annual qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment performed in  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of all reporting units would sufficiently exceed their carrying value and thus it was not necessary to perform the quantitative two step method 
the qualitative factors for our reporting units reviewed during our and assessments  with the exception of the three markets in which we performed a quantitative assessment  indicated stable or improving margins and favorable or stable forecasted economic conditions including stable discount rates and comparable business multiples 
additionally  the results of prior quantitative assessments supported significant excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units 
as a result of our annual quantitative impairment assessment  all of our reporting units had fair values in excess of carrying value and therefore  we did not record any goodwill impairment during the year ended december  based on the annual qualitative assessment for broadcast license impairment performed in  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of all broadcast licenses would sufficiently exceed their carrying values and thus it was not necessary to perform a quantitative test 
the qualitative factors for our broadcast licenses indicated an increase in market revenues  consistent expected market growth rates  stable market shares and stable cost factors from to we recorded a million interim impairment charge in the first quarter of due to an anticipated increase in construction costs for one of our stations as a result of converting to full power 
as a result of our annual impairment test for broadcast licenses in  we concluded that impairment did not exist 
the revenue  expense and constant growth rates used in determining the fair value of our broadcast licenses increased slightly from to the discount rates used to determine the fair value of our broadcast licenses did not change significantly from to during the year ended december   we recorded million in impairment on our broadcast licenses and other assets 
the million impairment charge recorded in was primarily the result of additional cash outflows for increased signal strength necessary to maintain competitive market positions 
we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to evaluate whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units and broadcast licenses was less than their carrying values 
if future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  including future events such as a deterioration of market conditions or significant increases in discount rates  we could be exposed to impairment charges in the future 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
for all other long lived assets  including fixed assets and definite lived intangibles  we assess recoverability of the assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we conclude that such triggering event has occurred  we perform a two step quantitative test to first assess whether the asset is recoverable by comparing the sum of undiscounted cash flows of the asset group to the carrying value of the asset group  including goodwill 
if the sum of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group  we then measure and allocate the amount of impairment to record for each of the assets in the asset group by comparing the respective fair value of the assets to their carrying values 
we did not have any indicators of impairment of our long lived assets in  or when factors indicate that there may be a decrease in value of an equity or cost method investment  we assess that investment and determine whether a loss in value has occurred 
if that loss is deemed to be other than temporary  an impairment loss is recorded 
for any investments that indicate a potential impairment  we estimate the fair value of those investments using discounted cash flow models  unrelated third party valuations or industry comparables  based on the various facts available to us 
during and  we recorded million and million of impairment on equity method investments  respectively 
no impairment of our equity or cost method investments was recorded revenue recognition 
advertising revenues  net of agency commissions  are recognized in the period during which commercials are aired 
all other revenues are recognized as services are provided 
the revenues realized from station barter arrangements are recorded as the programs are aired at the estimated fair value of the advertising airtime given in exchange for the program rights 
some of our retransmission consent agreements contain both advertising and retransmission consent elements that are paid in cash 
we have determined that these agreements are revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
advertising and retransmission consent deliverables sold under our agreements are separated into different units of accounting based on fair value 
revenue applicable to the advertising element of the arrangement is recognized consistent with the advertising revenue policy noted above 
revenue applicable to the retransmission consent element of the arrangement is recognized over the life of the agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from extending credit to our customers that are unable to make required payments 
if the economy and or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
for example  a increase in the balance of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   would increase bad 
table of contents debt expense by approximately million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
program contract costs 
we have agreements with distributors for the rights to televise programming over contract periods  which generally run from one to seven years 
contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period 
each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross cash contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing 
the portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in program contract assets and million and million  respectively  in program contract liabilities 
the programming rights are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value nrv 
estimated nrvs are based on management s expectation of future advertising revenue  net of sales commissions  to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms 
amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using a four year accelerated method or a straight line method  depending on the length of the contract 
program contract costs estimated by management to be amortized within one year are classified as current assets 
program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not impacted by adjustments for amortization or estimated nrv 
if our estimate of future advertising revenues declines  then additional write downs to nrv may be required 
income tax 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
as of december  we recorded million in deferred tax assets 
as of december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in deferred tax liabilities 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating our ability to realize net deferred tax assets  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our past operating results  tax planning strategies and forecasts of future taxable income 
in considering these sources of taxable income  we must make certain judgments that are based on the plans and estimates used to manage our underlying businesses on a long term basis 
a valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets related to a substantial portion of our available state net operating loss carryforwards  based on past operating results  expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary book tax basis differences  alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance for fair value measurements 
the purpose of the new guidance is to have a consistent definition of fair value between us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
many of the amendments to gaap are not expected to have a significant impact on practice  however  the new guidance does require new and enhanced disclosure about fair value measurements 
the amendments were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively 
this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements but we have included the additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures required for our level fair value measurements beginning with the quarter ended march  in september  the fasb issued the final accounting standards update for goodwill impairment testing 
the standard allows an entity to first consider qualitative factors when deciding whether it is necessary to perform the current two step goodwill impairment test 
an entity would need to perform step one if it determines qualitatively that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the changes are effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this new guidance in the fourth quarter of in completing our annual impairment analysis 
see note goodwill  broadcast licenses and other intangible assets for further discussion of the results of our goodwill impairment analysis 
this guidance impacts how we perform the annual goodwill impairment test  however  it did not impact our consolidated financial statements as the guidance does not impact the timing or amount of any resulting impairment charges 
in july  the fasb issued new guidance for testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the new guidance allows companies to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible assets is necessary  similar to the approach now applied to goodwill 
companies can first determine based on certain qualitative factors whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
the new standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  and early adoption is permitted 
we adopted this new guidance in the fourth quarter of when completing our annual impairment analysis 
see note goodwill  broadcast licenses and other intangible assets for further discussion of the results of our broadcast license impairment analysis 
this guidance impacted how we perform our annual impairment testing for 
table of contents indefinite lived intangible assets and changed our related disclosures for  however  it does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as the guidance does not impact the timing or amount of any resulting impairment charges 
results of operations in general  this discussion is related to the results of our continuing operations  except for discussions regarding our cash flows  which also include the results of our discontinued operations 
the results of the acquired stations from four points as of january  acquisition date  from freedom as of april  acquisition date and newport as of december  acquisition date are included in our results of our continuing operations 
in  we determined that the operating results of wlaj tv  which was one of the stations acquired in the freedom acquisition  and wlwc tv  which was one of the stations acquired in the four points acquisition  should be accounted for as discontinued operations and therefore the results are not included in our consolidated results of continuing operations year ended december  unless otherwise indicated  references in this discussion and analysis to  and are to our fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  any references to the first  second  third or fourth quarters are to the three months ended march  june  september and december  respectively  for the year being discussed 
we have two reportable segments  broadcast and other operating divisions that are disclosed separately from our corporate activities 
seasonality cyclicality our operating results are usually subject to seasonal fluctuations 
usually  the second and fourth quarter operating results are higher than the first and third quarters because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers 
our operating results are usually subject to fluctuations from political advertising 
in even numbered years  political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections 
additionally  every four years  political spending is usually elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election
