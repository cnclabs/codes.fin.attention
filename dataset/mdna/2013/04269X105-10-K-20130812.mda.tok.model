the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying audited financial statements and related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our fiscal year ends on june when we refer to a fiscal year or quarter  we are referring to the year in which the fiscal year ends and the quarters during that fiscal year 
therefore  fiscal refers to the fiscal year ended june  overview array is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted small molecule drugs to treat patients afflicted with cancer 
array is evolving into a late stage development company and is generating data to support our upcoming phase pivotal trial decisions 
novartis international pharmaceutical ltd 
began a phase trial evaluating array invented mek in nras mutant melanoma in july and expects to begin a phase trial in braf mutant melanoma in in addition  array began a phase trial evaluating mek in low grade serous ovarian cancer under the license agreement with novartis in june astrazeneca  plc began a pivotal trial with array invented selumetinib in thyroid cancer in may and expects to begin a phase trial in non small cell lung cancer in three other array invented drugs are also approaching phase or pivotal trial decisions which are expected by the end of these include array wholly owned drugs  arry and arry  and one partnered program  danoprevir with intermune roche 
our most advanced wholly owned clinical stage drugs include proprietary program indication clinical status arry ksp inhibitor for mm phase arry p tie dual inhibitor for mds phase arry p inhibitor for pain phase arry crth antagonist for asthma phase with our progress on arry for mm and arry for mds  we believe hematology oncology is the area of greatest opportunity for array and where we intend to concentrate our resources and build on our capabilities in fiscal and beyond 
therefore  we are seeking partners to advance our pain and asthma programs 

table of contents in addition  we have ongoing partner funded clinical programs  including two mek inhibitors in phase or clinical trials  mek with novartis and selumetinib with astrazeneca drug candidate indication partner clinical status mek mek inhibitor for cancer novartis international pharmaceutical ltd 
phase selumetinib mek inhibitor for cancer astrazeneca  plc phase pivotal danoprevir hepatitis c virus protease inhibitor intermune danoprevir now owned by roche holding ag phase arry aslan her egfr inhibitor for gastric cancer aslan pharmaceuticals pte ltd 
phase gdc akt inhibitor for cancer genentech inc phase ly chk inhibitor for cancer eli lilly and company phase vtx toll like receptor for cancer ventirx pharmaceuticals  inc phase gdc and gdc chk inhibitors for cancer genentech inc phase b arry her inhibitor for breast cancer oncothyreon inc phase gdc undisclosed cancer target genentech inc phase we also have a portfolio of proprietary and partnered preclinical drug discovery programs  including inhibitors that target trk receptors for the treatment of pain and other indications 
in july  we partnered with loxo oncology  inc  a newly formed  venture backed company  for continued development of certain preclinical compounds invented by array in the field of oncology that loxo will have the exclusive right to develop in clinical trials and to commercialize 
also in july  we partnered with celgene corporation to develop an array invented preclinical program targeting a novel inflammation pathway 
we may out license other select promising candidates through research partnerships in the future 
we have received a total of million in research funding and in up front and milestone payments from our partnerships and collaborations from inception through june   including million in initial payments from strategic agreements with amgen  genentech  novartis and oncothyreon that we entered into over the last four years 
our existing partnered programs entitle array to receive a total of approximately billion in additional milestone payments if we or our partners achieve the drug discovery  development and commercialization objectives detailed in those agreements 
we also have the potential to earn royalties on any resulting product sales or share in the proceeds from development or commercialization arrangements resulting from partnered programs 
business development and partner concentrations we currently license or partner certain of our compounds and or programs and enter into partnerships directly with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through opportunities identified by our business development group  senior management  scientists and customer referrals 
in general  our partners may terminate their collaboration agreements with to days prior notice 
our drug discovery collaboration agreement and our license agreement in oncology with genentech can be terminated with days and days notice  respectively 
novartis may terminate portions of our license agreement following a change in control of array  and may terminate our agreement in its entirety or on a product by product basis with days prior notice 
oncothyreon may terminate our development and commercialization agreement upon a material breach by array that remains uncured after applicable cure periods 
additional information related to the concentration of revenue among our partners is reported in note overview and basis of presentation concentration of business risks to the accompanying audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all of our partnership and collaboration agreements are denominated in us dollars 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our accompanying financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us gaap and which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  however  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for the performance of services or the shipment of products when each of the following four criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii products are delivered or as services are rendered  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we follow accounting standards codification  or asc   revenue recognition multiple element arrangements to determine the recognition of revenue under partnership and collaboration agreements that include multiple elements  including research and development services  achievement of development and commercialization milestones and drug product manufacturing 
this standard provides guidance on the accounting for arrangements involving the delivery of multiple elements when the delivery of separate units of accounting occurs in different reporting periods 
this standard addresses the determination of the units of accounting for multiple element arrangements and how the arrangement s consideration should be allocated to each unit of accounting 
we adopted this accounting standard on a prospective basis for all multiple element arrangements entered into on or after july   and for any multiple element arrangements that were entered into prior to july   but materially modified on or after july  we evaluate the deliverables under our multiple element arrangements to determine if they meet the separation criteria in asc and have stand alone value 
we allocate revenue to each identified deliverable based on its estimated stand alone value in relation to the combined estimated stand alone value of all deliverables  otherwise known as the relative selling price method 
the allocated consideration for each deliverable is then recognized over the related obligation period for that deliverable 
we treat deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria as a single unit of accounting  generally applying applicable revenue recognition guidance for the final deliverable to the combined unit of accounting 
we recognize revenue from non refundable up front payments and license fees in license and milestone revenue on a straight line basis over the term of performance under the agreement 
when the performance period is not specifically identifiable from the agreement  we estimate the performance period based upon provisions contained within the agreement  such as the duration of the research or development term 
we defer up front payments billed or received under our partnership and collaboration agreements  pending recognition over the applicable performance period 
the deferred portions of payments are classified as a short term or long term liability in the accompanying balance sheets  depending on the period during which revenue is expected to be recognized 
most of our agreements provide for milestone payments 
in certain cases  we recognize all or a portion of each milestone payment as revenue when the specific milestone is achieved based on the applicable percentage earned of the estimated research or development effort  or other performance obligations that have elapsed  to the total estimated research and or development effort attributable to the milestone 
in other cases  when the milestone payment is attributed to our future development obligations  we recognize the revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining development effort 
we record milestone payments as deferred revenue upon receipt or billing until recognized 
we periodically review the expected performance periods under each of our agreements that provide for non refundable up front payments  license fees or milestone payments 
we adjust the amortization periods when appropriate to reflect changes in assumptions relating to the duration of expected performance periods 
we could accelerate revenue recognition for non refundable up front payments  license fees and milestone payments in the event of early termination of programs or if our expectations change 
alternatively  we could decelerate such revenue recognition if programs are extended 
while changes to such estimates have no impact on our reported cash flows  our reported revenue may be significantly influenced by our estimates of the period over which our obligations are expected to be performed and  therefore  over which revenue is recognized 

table of contents see note deferred revenue to the accompanying audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further information about our partnerships 
cost of partnered programs and research and development expenses for proprietary programs where our partnership agreements provide for us to conduct research and development and for which our partner has an option to obtain the right to conduct further development and to commercialize a product  we attribute a portion of our research and development costs to cost of partnered programs based on the percentage of total programs under the agreement that we conclude is likely to continue to be funded by the partner 
the remaining costs are recorded in research and development expenses for proprietary programs 
these costs may not be incurred equally across all programs 
in addition  we continually evaluate the progress of development activities under these agreements and if events or circumstances change in future periods that we reasonably believe would make it unlikely that a partner would continue to fund the same percentage of programs  we will adjust the future allocation accordingly 
accrued outsourcing costs substantial portions of our preclinical studies and clinical trials are performed by third party laboratories  medical centers  contract research organizations and other vendors  or collectively cros 
these cros generally bill monthly or quarterly for services performed  or bill based upon milestone achievement 
for preclinical studies  we accrue expenses based upon estimated percentage of work completed and the contract milestones remaining 
for clinical studies  expenses are accrued based upon the number of patients enrolled and the duration of the study 
we monitor patient enrollment  the progress of clinical studies and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews of data reported to us by the cros  correspondence with the cros and clinical site visits 
our estimates depend on the timeliness and accuracy of the data provided by the cros regarding the status of each program and total program spending 
we periodically evaluate the estimates to determine if adjustments are necessary or appropriate based on information we receive 
convertible senior notes in june  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes due our convertible senior notes are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  asc  formerly fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
asc subtopic requires the issuer of convertible debt that may be settled in shares or cash upon conversion at their option  such as our notes  to account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components separately 
the value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of a similar debt instrument without the conversion option 
the amount of the equity component and resulting debt discount is calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the convertible debt instrument 
the resulting debt discount is amortized as additional non cash interest expense over the expected life of the notes utilizing the effective interest method 
although asc has no impact on our actual past or future cash flows  it requires us to record non cash interest expense as the debt discount is amortized 
for additional information  see note long term debt to the accompanying audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income in us gaap and ifrs 
asu no 
provided companies with the option to present the components of net income and comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two separate but consecutive statements 
it eliminated the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
we adopted asu no 
in the first quarter of fiscal using the single statement approach 
as this guidance related to presentation only  our adoption did not have any other effect on our financial statements 
results of operations license and milestone revenue license and milestone revenue consists of up front license fees and ongoing milestone payments from partners and collaborators 

table of contents below is a summary of our license and milestone revenue dollars in thousands change change year ended june  vs 
vs 
license revenue milestone revenue total license and milestone revenue fiscal compared to fiscal license revenue recognized during fiscal decreased compared to fiscal the majority of the revenue under our chk license agreement with genentech was recognized during fiscal  resulting in a decrease of approximately million between the comparable periods 
additionally  revenue recognized for the amgen up front fee was million lower during fiscal  as the amgen up front fee was fully recognized during the quarter ended december  the decreases were partially offset by additional revenue recognized during fiscal from the celgene up front payment and our new collaboration with oncothyreon 
recognition of the celgene up front payment received in was accelerated during the fourth quarter of fiscal as our obligations were determined to be complete 
additionally  we entered into a development and commercialization agreement with oncothyreon under which we received and recognized a million up front payment for licenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal please refer to note deferred revenue oncothyreon inc to the accompanying audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
milestone revenue decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due to reduced milestone revenue recognized under our collaboration with amgen from which we recognized million in fiscal  compared with million during the prior fiscal year when the million milestone payment was actually received 
additionally  we recognized only million from our collaboration with genentech during fiscal  compared with million during fiscal largely offsetting the decrease during the current year  was the recognition of million of the million milestone payment earned under our collaboration with novartis as a result of the commencement of the first phase trial during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as a million milestone payment received from ventirx for initiating a phase clinical study 
fiscal compared to fiscal license revenue increased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
we recognized increased license revenue of million during fiscal due to our llicense agreement with genentech for our chk program  arry there was no corresponding revenue for the chk program in fiscal partially offsetting this increase was reduced revenue from the suspended amortization of the up front license fees previously received from celgene following temporary suspension of the associated research activities 
milestone revenue increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily due to the recognition of million of the million milestone payment we received from amgen during the fourth quarter of fiscal for enrollment of patients in a phase study of amg arry during fiscal  we also recognized million of additional revenue related to a full year of amortization for the million celgene milestone payment received in fiscal collaboration revenue collaboration revenue consists of revenue for our performance of drug discovery and development activities in collaboration with partners  which include development of proprietary drug candidates we out license  as well as screening  lead generation and lead optimization research  custom synthesis and process research and  to a small degree  the development and sale of chemical compounds 
below is a summary of our collaboration revenue dollars in thousands change change year ended june  vs 
vs 
collaboration revenue 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal collaboration revenue decreased during fiscal compared to the prior year due to reduced revenues under our collaboration with genentech and the completion of our funded discovery research under our collaboration with amgen  which were largely offset by our new collaborations  as well as the additional funded research under our collaboration with celgene 
fiscal compared to fiscal collaboration revenue decreased during fiscal due to fewer scientists engaged on our collaborations with genentech and amgen during the second half of fiscal  compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decrease was partially offset by revenue for full time equivalents  or ftes  working on our collaborations with celgene and dna biopharma for which there was no corresponding revenue in fiscal cost of partnered programs cost of partnered programs represents costs attributable to discovery and development including preclinical and clinical trials we may conduct for or with our partners and the cost of chemical compounds sold from our inventory 
these costs consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits  share based compensation  preclinical and clinical outsourcing costs and other partnership related costs  including supplies  small tools  travel and meals  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation costs and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs 
in prior periods  we referred to cost of partnered programs as cost of revenue in our financial statements  notes and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
below is a summary of our cost of partnered programs dollars in thousands change change year ended june  vs 
vs 
cost of partnered programs cost of partnered programs as a percentage of total revenue fiscal compared to fiscal cost of partnered programs increased during fiscal compared to fiscal due to increasing costs to advance our mek inhibitor through clinical trials under our co development arrangement with novartis  as well as our new collaborations and our extended collaboration with celgene 
reduced costs under our collaboration with genentech partially offset the increases and were associated with engaging fewer scientists in the current fiscal year compared with fiscal cost of partnered programs as a percentage of total revenue increased for the current fiscal year  primarily because of the increased actual costs as noted above and the decreased license and milestone revenue recognized during the period 
fiscal compared to fiscal cost of partnered programs decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of fewer scientists engaged on our collaborations with genentech and amgen during the second half of fiscal cost of partnered programs decreased as a percentage of total revenue due to the increased license and milestone revenue recognized in fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary programs our research and development expenses for proprietary programs include costs associated with our proprietary drug programs for scientific and clinical personnel  supplies  inventory  equipment  small tools  travel and meals  depreciation  consultants  sponsored research  allocated facility costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical trials and share based compensation 
we manage our proprietary programs based on scientific data and achievement of research plan goals 
our scientists record their time to specific projects when possible  however  many activities simultaneously benefit multiple projects and cannot be readily attributed to a specific project 
accordingly  the accurate assignment of time and costs to a specific project is difficult and may not give a true indication of the actual costs of a particular project 
as a result  we do not report costs on a program basis

vs 
salaries  benefits and share based compensation outsourced services and consulting laboratory supplies facilities and depreciation other fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary programs increased during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is the result of costs associated with the phase asthma study of arry that concluded in july  and focusing resources on our wholly owned programs and progressing them through more advanced stages of clinical trials 
fiscal compared to fiscal research and development expenses for proprietary programs decreased during fiscal compared to the prior year 
the decrease was the result of our new license agreement with genentech and our new collaboration and license agreement with aslan pharmaceuticals  which resulted in the corresponding program costs shifting to the collaboration partner 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and associated fringe benefits not included in cost of partnered programs or research and development expenses for proprietary programs and include other management  business development  accounting  information technology and administration costs  including patent filing and prosecution  recruiting and relocation  consulting and professional services  travel and meals  sales commissions  facilities  depreciation and other office expenses 
below is a summary of our general and administrative expenses dollars in thousands change change year ended june  vs 
vs 
general and administrative fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses increased during the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily related to compensation  benefits and costs to recruit certain leadership positions to help execute our strategic objectives 
we also incurred approximately thousand in additional costs during the current fiscal year to obtain and prosecute our patents and thousand in additional costs for legal  business development consulting and other professional services 
fiscal compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily for lower compensation related costs following the reduction in force during june  as well as a reduction in stock compensation expense related to the termination of our former ceo 
partially offsetting these decreases were additional costs incurred to hire our new ceo and search fees for our new board member 
additionally  business related tax expenses were down approximately thousand

loss on prepayment of long term debt  net is associated with the write off of debt discounts and debt transaction fees upon the early payment of principal under credit facilities we maintained with deerfield capital in the fiscal years ended june  and  and the write off of the remaining balances of debt discount and debt transaction fees associated with the deerfield credit facilities upon full repayment in june the following table shows the details of our interest expense for all of our debt arrangements outstanding during the periods presented  including actual interest paid  amortization of debt and loan transaction fees  and losses on early prepayment that were charged to interest expense in thousands year ended june  comerica term loan simple interest amortization of fees paid for letters of credit total interest expense on the comerica term loan convertible senior notes simple interest amortization of debt discount amortization of debt issuance costs total interest expense on the convertible senior notes deerfield credit facilities simple interest amortization of debt discounts and transaction fees change in fair value of the embedded derivatives total interest expense on the deerfield credit facilities total interest expense interest expense was comparable for the fiscal years ended june  and  as the issuance of the convertible senior notes and early repayment of the credit facilities with deerfield capital did not occur until june interest expense during fiscal was lower than fiscal due to a lower interest rate and lower average outstanding balance under the deerfield credit facilities  as well as a reduced level of amortization for debt discounts following the modification to the deerfield credit facilities in may 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses and an accumulated deficit as a result of ongoing research and development spending since inception 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we had net losses of million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
for the year ended june   our net cash used in operations was million 
we have historically funded our operations from up front fees and license and milestone payments received under our drug partnerships  the sale of equity securities  and debt provided by credit facilities and our recent convertible debt offering 
for example  we received net proceeds of approximately million in june and million during calendar year from an underwritten offering of convertible debt and underwritten public offerings of our common stock  respectively  after underwriting discounts  commissions and related offering expenses 
additionally  we have received million from up front fees and license and milestone payments under our partnerships since december  including the following payments in december  we received a million up front payment from amgen under a collaboration and license agreement 
during may and june  we received a total of million in up front and milestone payments under a license agreement with novartis 
in december  we received a million milestone payment under a drug discovery and development agreement with celgene 
in may  we received a million milestone payment under a license agreement with novartis 
in september  we received a million up front payment under a drug discovery collaboration agreement with genentech 
in june  we received an million milestone payment from amgen under a collaboration and license agreement 
in june  we received a million up front payment under a development and commercialization agreement with oncothyreon 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from operations  which we do not expect to achieve in the foreseeable future  we will continue to utilize existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and will continue to depend on funds provided from the sources mentioned above  which may not be available or forthcoming 
during fiscal  we began paying our share of the combined development costs incurred since commencement of our agreement with novartis for development of the mek program  as discussed in note deferred revenue novartis international pharmaceutical ltd 
to the accompanying audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we paid million to novartis during the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we committed to continue our co development contribution through fiscal  we have the right to opt out of paying our co development contribution on an annual basis after fiscal we have reported a million payable in the accompanying balance sheets as co development liability for this obligation as of june   and we anticipate paying this amount to novartis during the first half of fiscal management believes that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of june   and the anticipated receipt of up front and milestone payments under new and existing partnerships  will enable us to continue to fund operations in the normal course of business for at least the next months 
because sufficient funds may not be available to us when needed from existing partnerships  we expect that we will be required to continue to fund our operations in part through the sale of debt or equity securities and through licensing select programs that include up front and or milestone payments 
additionally  on august   we implemented a reduction in our workforce 
our estimates indicate that we will save approximately million per quarter from this reduction  not including the one time restructuring charge of approximately million that we expect to incur during the first quarter of fiscal see note subsequent events to the accompanying audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further discussion 
our ability to successfully raise sufficient funds through the sale of debt or equity securities or from debt financing from lenders when needed is subject to many risks and uncertainties and  even if we are successful  future equity issuances would result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
we also may not successfully consummate new partnerships that provide for up front fees or milestone payments  or we may not earn milestone payments under such partnerships when 
table of contents anticipated  or at all 
our ability to realize milestone or royalty payments under existing partnership agreements and to enter into new partnering arrangements that generate additional revenue through up front fees and milestone or royalty payments is subject to a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control and include the following the drug development process is risky and highly uncertain and we may not be successful in generating proof of concept data to create partnering opportunities and  even if we are successful  we or our partners may not be successful in commercializing drug candidates we create  we may fail to select the best drug from our wholly owned pipeline to advance and invest in registration or phase studies  our partners have substantial control and discretion over the timing and continued development and marketing of drug candidates we create and  therefore  we may not receive milestone  royalty or other payments when anticipated or at all  the drug candidates we or our partners develop may not obtain regulatory approval  if regulatory approval is received  drugs we develop will remain subject to regulation or may not gain market acceptance  which could delay or prevent us from generating milestone  royalty or product revenue from the commercialization of these drugs  and we cannot control or predict the spending priorities and willingness of pharmaceutical companies to in license drugs for further development and commercialization 
our assessment of our future need for funding and our ability to continue to fund our operations is a forward looking statement that is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual future capital requirements could vary as a result of a number of factors  including our ability to enter into agreements to out license  co develop or commercialize our proprietary drug candidates and the timing of payments under those agreements throughout each candidate s development stage  the number and scope of our research and development programs  the progress and success of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the progress and success of the development efforts of our partners  our ability to maintain current collaboration and partnership agreements  the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and or the expenses associated with unforeseen litigation  regulatory changes  competition and technological developments  general economic and market conditions and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses  products and technologies 
if we are unable to generate enough revenue from our existing or new partnerships when needed or secure additional sources of funding  it may be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending through further reductions in staff and delaying  scaling back or stopping certain research and development programs  including more costly phase and phase clinical trials on our wholly owned or co development programs as these programs progress into later stage development 
insufficient liquidity may also require us to relinquish greater rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms to us and our stockholders than we would otherwise choose in order to obtain up front license fees needed to fund operations 
these events could prevent us from successfully executing our operating plan and  in the future  could raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
further  as discussed in note long term debt to the accompanying audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the entire outstanding debt balance of million with comerica bank  or comerica  plus any related unpaid variable interest  becomes due and payable if our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities falls below million at the end of a fiscal quarter 
based on our current forecasts and expectations  which are subject to many factors outside of our control  we do not anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will fall below this level prior to maturity of such debt 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities cash equivalents are short term  highly liquid financial instruments that are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of days or less from the date of purchase 

table of contents short term marketable securities consist primarily of us government agency obligations with maturities of greater than days when purchased 
long term marketable securities are primarily securities held under our deferred compensation plan

vs 
cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities total fiscal compared to fiscal net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended june   compared to million for the same period of the prior year 
the change was due in part to the million up front license fee we received from genentech in fiscal  compared with million received from oncothyreon and recognized in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal we also made a million payment to novartis in the second quarter of fiscal for our share of accrued development costs incurred since inception of the program  for which we had no comparable payment in fiscal decreased receipts for discovery research and milestones under our collaboration with genentech further reduced operating cash flows during the current fiscal year 
additionally  we recorded receivables for two milestones totaling million that were earned in june net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal  compared with million during the same period of the prior year 
during both periods  subsequent to raising capital through the sale of our common stock and convertible debt  we made net purchases in marketable securities  resulting in the use of cash for investing purposes 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities was the result of net proceeds from our convertible debt offering of million  as well as million in net proceeds from our fiscal underwritten public offering of shares of our common stock  compared to million in net proceeds raised from a similar offering in fiscal these increases were offset by a million repayment of long term debt  million of which was attributable to full repayment of our debt with deerfield capital  compared with a million payment on those facilities during fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  we received million from genentech and amgen for up front and milestone payments under our collaboration agreements with them  which decreased our cash used in operations compared to fiscal investing activities used net cash of million for fiscal compared with providing cash of million in fiscal net cash proceeds from sales of marketable securities decreased by million in fiscal compared to the prior year 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the difference between the periods is primarily attributable to million of net proceeds received from the sale of million shares of our common stock in a public offering during february offsetting the increase cash provided by financing activities was the million payment of principal on the deerfield credit facilities 

table of contents obligations and commitments the following table shows our contractual obligations and commitments as of june  in thousands less than year to years to years over years total debt obligations interest on debt obligations co development liability operating lease commitments purchase obligations total reflected in the accompanying balance sheets 
these obligations are not reflected in the accompanying balance sheets 
interest on the variable debt obligation under the term loan with comerica is calculated at  the interest rate in effect as of june  interest on the notes is calculated at  which is the coupon rate 
we are obligated under non cancellable operating leases for all of our facilities and  to a limited degree  equipment leases 
original lease terms for our facilities in effect as of june   were five to ten years and generally require us to pay the real estate taxes  certain insurance and other operating costs 
equipment lease terms generally range from three to five years 
purchase obligations include million for outsourced services for clinical trials and other research and development costs 
the remaining million is for all other purchase commitments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and fluctuations in interest rates 
all of our partnership agreements and nearly all purchase orders are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  historically and as of june   we have had little or no exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency or exchange rates 
our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of readily marketable  high quality securities diversified and structured to minimize market risks 
we target our average portfolio maturity at one year or less 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments in marketable securities 
marketable securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to changes in market value in response to changes in interest rates and liquidity 
a significant change in market interest rates could have a material impact on interest income earned from our investment portfolio 
a theoretical basis point change in interest rates could result in a potential gain or loss in fair value of approximately thousand based on the current balance of million of investments classified as short term and long term marketable securities available for sale 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  however  we will not recognize such gains or losses in our statement of operations and comprehensive loss unless the investments are sold 
our term loan with comerica of million is our only variable rate debt 
assuming constant debt levels  a theoretical change of basis points on our current interest rate of on the comerica debt as of june   would result in a change in our annual interest expense of thousand 
historically  and as of june   we have not used foreign currency derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities
