item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations research and development expense 
geographic area financial information our chief operating decision maker ie  our chief executive officer reviews financial information on a consolidated basis  for the purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance 
there are no segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision maker  or anyone else  for operations  operating results and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level 
accordingly  we consider ourselves to have a single reporting segment and operating unit structure 
net product revenues by geography are based on patients locations for naglazyme  kuvan and firdapse  and are based on genzyme s us location for aldurazyme 
although genzyme sells aldurazyme worldwide  the royalties we earned on genzyme s net sales are included in the us as our transactions are with genzyme 
the following table outlines net product revenues by geographic area in thousands years ended december  net product revenues united states europe latin america rest of the world total net product revenues total revenue generated outside the us was million  million and million  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following table outlines non monetary long lived assets by geographic area in thousands years ended december  non monetary long lived assets united states international total long lived assets the decrease in non monetary long lived assets is primarily attributed to amortization of intangible assets and deprecation of property  plant and equipment  offset by capital expenditures

risk factors an investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing industry that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
other risks and uncertainties  including those that we do not currently consider material  may impair our business 
if any of the risks discussed below actually occur  our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our securities to decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
if we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approval to commercially market and sell our drugs  or if approval is delayed  we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products  our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished  and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased 
we must obtain and maintain regulatory approval to market and sell our drug products in the us and in jurisdictions outside of the us in the us  we must obtain fda approval for each drug that we intend to commercialize 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
products distributed abroad are also subject to government regulation by international regulatory authorities 
naglazyme  aldurazyme and kuvan have received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed and sold in the us  eu and other countries 
firdapse has received regulatory approval to be commercially marketed only in the eu 
although we announced in november that our phase study of vimizim  an enzyme replacement therapy for patients with mps iva morquio syndrome  had met its primary endpoint  vimizim has not received regulatory approval in the us  eu or any other jurisdiction and may never receive approval 
also  even if we receive priority review timelines from the fda for vimizim  there is no assurance that the fda will comply with such timelines and there may be delays and ultimately the fda may decide not to approve vimizim 
as part of the recent reauthorization of pdufa  new biologics are included in a new product review program intended to enhance fda sponsor communications to lead to greater first cycle approval decisions 
as part of this program  applications for new biologics are subject to either a month standard or month priority review period that begins from the date of application submission 
however  since this is a new product review program and no products have completed this new review process  the priority review period may take longer than eight months and the standard review period may take longer than months 
similarly  although the ema has an accelerated approval process  the timelines mandated by the regulations are subject to the possibility of substantial delays 
in addition  the fda and its international equivalents have substantial discretion over the approval process for pharmaceutical products 
as such  these regulatory agencies may in the end not agree that we have demonstrated the requisite level of product safety and efficacy to grant approval and may require additional data 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates  including vimizim  we will be unable to market and sell those drug products 
because of the risks and uncertainties in pharmaceutical development  our product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval 
we also rely on independent third party contract research organizations  or cros  to file 
table of contents some of our ex us and ex eu marketing applications and important aspects of the services performed for us by the cros are out of our direct control 
if we fail to adequately manage our cros  if the cro elects to prioritize work on our projects below other projects or if there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our cros  the filing of our applications may be delayed 
from time to time during the regulatory approval process for our products and our product candidates  we engage in discussions with the fda and comparable international regulatory authorities regarding the regulatory requirements for our development programs 
to the extent appropriate  we accommodate the requests of the regulatory authorities and  to date  we have generally been able to reach reasonable accommodations and resolutions regarding the underlying issues 
however  we are often unable to determine the outcome of such deliberations until they are final 
if we are unable to effectively and efficiently resolve and comply with the inquiries and requests of the fda and other non us regulatory authorities  the approval of our product candidates may be delayed and their value may be reduced 
after any of our products receive regulatory approval  they remain subject to ongoing regulation  which can impact  among other things product labeling  manufacturing practices  adverse event reporting  storage  expiration  distribution  advertising and promotion  and record keeping 
if we do not comply with the applicable regulations  the range of possible sanctions includes issuance of adverse publicity  product recalls or seizures  fines  total or partial suspensions of production and or distribution  suspension of marketing applications  and enforcement actions  including injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution 
the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies can withdraw a product s approval under some circumstances  such as the failure to comply with regulatory requirements or unexpected safety issues 
further  the fda often requires post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products 
the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies may condition approval of our product candidates on the completion of such post marketing clinical studies 
these post marketing studies may suggest that a product causes undesirable side effects or may present a risk to the patient 
if data we collect from post marketing studies suggest that one of our approved products may present a risk to safety  the government authorities could withdraw our product approval  suspend production or place other marketing restrictions on our products 
if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is delayed or withdrawn  the value of our company and our operating results will be adversely affected 
additionally  we will be unable to generate revenue from the sale of these products  our potential for generating positive cash flow will be diminished and the capital necessary to fund our operations will be increased 
if we fail to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for some of our products  our competitors may sell products to treat the same conditions and our revenues will be reduced 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to develop some drugs that may be eligible for fda and eu orphan drug designation 
under the orphan drug act  the fda may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition  defined as a patient population of fewer than  in the us the company that first obtains fda approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the stated condition for a period of seven years 
orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost if the fda later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug 
similar regulations are available in the eu with a ten year period of market exclusivity 
because the extent and scope of patent protection for some of our drug products is limited  orphan drug designation is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation 
for eligible drugs  we plan to rely on the exclusivity period under the orphan drug act to maintain a competitive position 
if we do not obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our drug products that do not have broad patent protection  our competitors may then sell the same drug to treat the same condition and our revenues will be reduced 
even though we have obtained orphan drug designation for certain of our products and product candidates and even if we obtain orphan drug designation for our future product candidates  due to the uncertainties 
table of contents associated with developing pharmaceutical products  we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication 
further  even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product  that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition 
even after an orphan drug is approved  the fda can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the fda concludes that the later drug is safer  more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care 
orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug  nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process 
we may face competition from biological products approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway 
our naglazyme and aldurazyme products  as well as certain of our product candidates  including vimizim  are regulated by the fda as biologics under the federal food  drug and cosmetics act  or the fdc act  and the public health service act 
biologics require the submission of a biologics license application bla  and approval by the fda prior to being marketed in the us historically  a biologic product approved under a bla was not subject to the generic drug review and approval provisions of the fdc act 
however  the patient protection and affordable care act of  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of  or collectively  the ppaca  created a regulatory pathway for the abbreviated approval for biological products that are demonstrated to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an fda approved biological product 
in order to meet the standard of interchangeability  a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product  and for a product that is administered more than once  that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product 
such biosimilars would reference biological products approved in the us the law establishes a period of years of data exclusivity for reference products  which protects the data in the original bla by prohibiting sponsors of biosimilars from gaining fda approval based in part on reference to data in the original bla 
our products approved under blas  as well as products in development that may be approved under blas  could be reference products for such abbreviated blas 
to obtain regulatory approval to market our products  preclinical studies and costly and lengthy preclinical and clinical trials are required and the results of the studies and trials are highly uncertain 
as part of the regulatory approval process  we must conduct  at our own expense  preclinical studies in the laboratory and clinical trials on humans for each product candidate 
we expect the number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that the regulatory authorities will require will vary depending on the product candidate  the disease or condition the drug is being developed to address and regulations applicable to the particular drug 
generally  the number and size of clinical trials required for approval increases based on the expected patient population that may be treated with a drug 
we may need to perform multiple preclinical studies using various doses and formulations before we can begin clinical trials  which could result in delays in our ability to market any of our product candidates 
furthermore  even if we obtain favorable results in preclinical studies  the results in humans may be significantly different 
after we have conducted preclinical studies  we must demonstrate that our drug products are safe and efficacious for use in the targeted human patients in order to receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
adverse or inconclusive clinical results would stop us from filing for regulatory approval of our product candidates 
additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials include slow or insufficient patient enrollment  slow recruitment of  and completion of necessary institutional approvals at  clinical sites  longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy  lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate  
table of contents adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients  lack of effectiveness of the product candidate being tested  and regulatory requests for additional clinical trials 
typically  if a drug product is intended to treat a chronic disease  as is the case with some of our product candidates  safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time  which can range from nine months to three years or more 
we also rely on independent third party contract research organizations  or cros  to perform most of our clinical studies and many important aspects of the services performed for us by the cros are out of our direct control 
if we fail to adequately manage our cros  or if there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our cros  our clinical trials may be delayed 
moreover  in our regulatory submissions  we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third party cros 
if any of our cros processes  methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate  our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals could adversely be impacted 
if we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than anticipated  we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations 
since we began operations in march  we have been engaged in very substantial research and development and operated at a net loss until although we were profitable in and  we operated at a net loss in  and based upon our current plan for investments in research and development for existing and new programs  we expect to operate at a net loss for at least the next months 
our future profitability depends on our marketing and selling of naglazyme  kuvan and firdapse  the successful continued commercialization of aldurazyme by genzyme  the receipt of regulatory approval of our product candidates  our ability to successfully manufacture and market any approved drugs  either by ourselves or jointly with others  our spending on our development programs and the impact of any possible future business development transactions 
the extent of our future losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain 
if we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis  then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations 
if we fail to comply with manufacturing regulations  our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
before we can begin commercial manufacture of our products  we  or our contract manufacturers  must obtain regulatory approval of our manufacturing facilities  processes and quality systems 
in addition  our pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to inspection by the fda and international regulatory authorities  before and after product approval 
our manufacturing facilities in the us have been approved by the fda  the european commission ec  and health agencies in other countries for the manufacture of aldurazyme and naglazyme 
the manufacturing facility located in shanbally  cork  ireland that we purchased in has not yet been approved by the fda or ema 
in addition  our third party manufacturers facilities involved with the manufacture of naglazyme  kuvan  firdapse and aldurazyme have also been inspected and approved by various regulatory authorities 
due to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture our products and product candidates  we may be unable to continue to pass or initially pass federal or international regulatory inspections in a cost effective manner 
for the same reason  any potential third party manufacturer of naglazyme  kuvan  aldurazyme and firdapse or our product candidates may be unable to comply with gmp regulations in a cost effective manner and may be unable to initially or continue to pass a federal or international regulatory inspection 
if we  or third party manufacturers with whom we contract  are unable to comply with manufacturing regulations  we may be subject to fines  unanticipated compliance expenses  recall or seizure of our products  total or partial suspension of production and or enforcement actions  including injunctions  and criminal or civil prosecution 
these possible sanctions would adversely affect our financial results and financial condition 

table of contents if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  our financial results and financial condition will be adversely affected and we will have to delay or terminate some or all of our product development programs 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments totaling million 
we may require additional financing to fund our future operations  including the commercialization of our approved drugs and drug product candidates currently under development  preclinical studies and clinical trials  and potential licenses and acquisitions 
we may be unable to raise additional financing  if needed  due to a variety of factors  including our financial condition  the status of our product programs  and the general condition of the financial markets 
if we fail to raise additional financing if we need such funds  we may have to delay or terminate some or all of our product development programs and our financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected 
we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts of capital for our operations for the foreseeable future 
the amount of capital we will need depends on many factors  including our ability to successfully market and sell naglazyme  kuvan and firdapse  genzyme s ability to continue to successfully commercialize aldurazyme  the progress and success of our preclinical studies and clinical trials including studies and the manufacture of materials  the timing  number  size and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and the costs of post marketing studies which may be required by regulatory authorities  the time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes  including quality systems  and to build or acquire manufacturing capabilities  the progress of research programs carried out by us  our possible achievement of milestones identified in our purchase agreements with the former stockholders of lead therapeutics  inc  zystor  huxley pharmaceuticals  inc  and zacharon pharmaceuticals inc 
that trigger related milestone payments  any changes made to  or new developments in  our existing collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships or any new collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish  and whether our convertible debt is converted to common stock in the future 
moreover  our fixed expenses such as rent  license payments  interest expense and other contractual commitments are substantial and may increase in the future 
these fixed expenses may increase because we may enter into additional licenses and collaborative agreements  additional contracts for product manufacturing  and additional financing facilities 
we may need to raise additional funds from equity or debt securities  loans or collaborative agreements if we are unable to satisfy our liquidity requirements 
the sale of additional securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
furthermore  additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us or at all 
this could result in the delay  reduction or termination of our research  which could harm our business 

table of contents if we are unable to successfully develop and maintain manufacturing processes for our drug products to produce sufficient quantities at acceptable costs  we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue  have reduced margins or be forced to terminate a program 
due to the complexity of manufacturing our products  we may not be able to manufacture drug products successfully with a commercially viable process or at a scale large enough to support their respective commercial markets or at acceptable margins 
the development of commercially viable manufacturing processes typically is very difficult to achieve and is often very expensive and may require extended periods of time 
changes in manufacturing processes including manufacturing cell lines  equipment or facilities may require us to complete clinical trials to receive regulatory approval of any manufacturing improvements 
also  we may be required to demonstrate product comparability between a biological product made after a manufacturing change and the product made before implementation of the change through additional types of analytical and functional testing or may have to complete additional clinical studies 
also  if we contract for manufacturing services with an unproven process  our contractor is subject to the same uncertainties  high standards and regulatory controls  and may therefore experience difficulty if further process development is necessary 
even a developed manufacturing process can encounter difficulties 
problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons  including human error  mechanical breakdowns  problems with raw materials and cell banks  malfunctions of internal information technology systems  and other events that cannot always be prevented or anticipated 
many of the processes include biological systems  which add significant complexity  as compared to chemical synthesis 
we expect that  from time to time  consistent with biotechnology industry expectations  certain production lots will fail to produce product that meets our quality control release acceptance criteria 
to date  our historical failure rates for all of our product programs  including naglazyme  aldurazyme and vimizim  have been within our expectations  which are based on industry norms 
if the failure rate increased substantially  we could experience increased costs  lost revenue  damage to customer relations  time and expense investigating the cause and  depending upon the cause  similar losses with respect to other lots or products 
if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market  recall and product liability costs may also be incurred 
in order to produce product within our time and cost parameters  we must continue to produce product within our expected success rate and yield expectations 
because of the complexity of our manufacturing processes  it may be difficult or impossible for us to determine the cause of any particular lot failure and we must effectively take corrective action in response to any failure in a timely manner 
although we have entered into contractual relationships with third party manufacturers to produce the active ingredient in kuvan and firdapse  if those manufacturers are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations  we may be unable to meet demand for these products or sell these products at all and we may lose potential revenue 
we have contracts for the production of final product for kuvan and firdapse 
we also rely on third parties for portions of the manufacture of naglazyme and aldurazyme 
if those manufacturers are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or satisfy demand outside of or in excess of the contractual obligations  we may be unable to meet demand for these products or sell these products at all and we may lose potential revenue 
further  the availability of suitable contract manufacturing capacity at scheduled or optimum times is not certain 
in addition  our manufacturing processes subject us to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes resulting from their use 
we may incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations 
if we are unable to effectively address manufacturing issues  we may be unable to meet demand for our products and lose potential revenue  have reduced margins  or be forced to terminate a program 

table of contents our manufacturing facility for naglazyme  aldurazyme and vimizim is located near known earthquake fault zones  and the occurrence of an earthquake or other catastrophic disaster could cause damage to our facility and equipment  or that of our third party manufacturers or single source suppliers  which could materially impair our ability to manufacture naglazyme  aldurazyme and vimizim or our third party manufacturer s ability to manufacture kuvan or firdapse 
our galli drive facility located in novato  california is currently our only manufacturing facility for naglazyme  aldurazyme and vimizim 
it is located in the san francisco bay area near known earthquake fault zones and is vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes 
we  and the third party manufacturers with whom we contract and our single source suppliers of raw materials  which include many of our critical raw materials  are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  including fires  floods  power loss and similar events 
if any disaster were to occur  or any terrorist or criminal activity caused significant damage to our facilities or the facilities of our third party manufacturers and suppliers  our ability to manufacture naglazyme  aldurazyme and vimizim  or to have kuvan or firdapse manufactured  could be seriously  or potentially completely impaired  and our commercialization efforts and revenue could be seriously impaired 
the insurance that we carry  the inventory that we maintain and our risk mitigation plans may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
supply interruptions may disrupt our inventory levels and the availability of our products and cause delays in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates  or harm our business by reducing our revenues 
numerous factors could cause interruptions in the supply of our finished products  including timing  scheduling and prioritization of production by our contract manufacturers or a breach of our agreements by our contract manufacturers  labor interruptions  changes in our sources for manufacturing  the timing and delivery of shipments  our failure to locate and obtain replacement manufacturers as needed on a timely basis  and conditions affecting the cost and availability of raw materials 
any interruption in the supply of finished products could hinder our ability to distribute finished products to meet commercial demand 
with respect to our product candidates  production of product is necessary to perform clinical trials and successful registration batches are necessary to file for approval to commercially market and sell product candidates 
delays in obtaining clinical material or registration batches could delay regulatory approval for our product candidates 
because the target patient populations for our products are small  we must achieve significant market share and maintain high per patient prices for our products to achieve profitability 
all of our products target diseases with small patient populations 
as a result  our per patient prices must be relatively high in order to recover our development and manufacturing costs and achieve profitability 
for naglazyme and vimizim  if approved  we must market worldwide to achieve significant market penetration of the product 
in addition  because the number of potential patients in the disease populations are small  it is not only important to find patients who begin therapy to achieve significant market penetration of the product  but we also need to be able to maintain these patients on therapy for an extended period of time 
due to the expected costs of treatment for our products for genetic diseases  we may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient market share at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts and manufacturing expenses 

table of contents if we fail to obtain an adequate level of coverage and reimbursement for our drug products by third party payers  the sales of our drugs would be adversely affected or there may be no commercially viable markets for our products 
the course of treatment for patients using our products is expensive 
we expect patients to need treatment for extended periods  and for some products throughout the lifetimes of the patients 
we expect that most families of patients will not be capable of paying for this treatment themselves 
there will be no commercially viable market for our products without coverage and reimbursement from third party payers 
additionally  even if there is a commercially viable market  if the level of reimbursement is below our expectations  our revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected 
third party payers  such as government or private health care insurers  carefully review and increasingly challenge the prices charged for drugs 
reimbursement rates from private companies vary depending on the third party payer  the insurance plan and other factors 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region  and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country by country basis 
reimbursement in the eu must be negotiated on a country by country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved 
the timing to complete the negotiation process in each country is highly uncertain  and in some countries we expect that it may exceed months 
for our future products  we will not know what the reimbursement rates will be until we are ready to market the product and we actually negotiate the rates 
if we are unable to obtain sufficiently high reimbursement rates for our products  they may not be commercially viable or our future revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our international sales are made based on special access programs  and changes to these programs could adversely affect our product sales and revenue in these countries 
we make a significant portion of our international sales of naglazyme through special access or named patient programs  which do not require full product approval 
we expect to also utilize these programs for vimizim 
the specifics of the programs vary from country to country 
generally  special approval must be obtained for each patient 
the approval normally requires an application or a lawsuit accompanied by evidence of medical need 
generally  the approvals for each patient must be renewed from time to time 
these programs are not well defined in some countries and are subject to changes in requirements and funding levels 
any change to these programs could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in those countries and delay sales 
if the programs are not funded by the respective government  there could be insufficient funds to pay for all patients 
further  governments have in the past undertaken and may in the future undertake  unofficial measures to limit purchases of our products  including initially denying coverage for purchasers  delaying orders and denying or taking excessively long to approve customs clearance 
any such actions could materially delay or reduce our revenues from such countries 
without the special access programs  we would need to seek full product approval to commercially market and sell our products 
this can be an expensive and time consuming process and may subject our products to additional price controls 
because the number of patients is so small in some countries  it may not be economically feasible to seek and maintain a full product approval  and therefore the sales in such country would be permanently reduced or eliminated 
for all of these reasons  if the special access programs that we are currently using are eliminated or restricted  our revenues could be adversely affected 

table of contents if we fail to compete successfully with respect to product sales  we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product and our revenue could be adversely affected 
our competitors may develop  manufacture and market products that are more effective or less expensive than ours 
they may also obtain regulatory approvals for their products faster than we can obtain them including those products with orphan drug designation or commercialize their products before we do 
if we do not compete successfully  our revenue would be adversely affected  and we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to recover our expenses related to the development of a product program or to justify continued marketing of a product 
government price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products  which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
we expect that coverage and reimbursement may be increasingly restricted both in the us and internationally 
the escalating cost of health care has led to increased pressure on the health care industry to reduce costs 
governmental and private third party payers have proposed health care reforms and cost reductions 
a number of federal and state proposals to control the cost of health care  including the cost of drug treatments  have been made in the us in some international markets  the government controls the pricing  which can affect the profitability of drugs 
current government regulations and possible future legislation regarding health care may affect coverage and reimbursement for medical treatment by third party payers  which may render our products not commercially viable or may adversely affect our future revenues and gross margins 
international operations are also generally subject to extensive price and market regulations  and there are many proposals for additional cost containment measures  including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or mandatory price cuts or reduce the value of our intellectual property portfolio 
as part of these cost containment measures  some countries have imposed or threatened to impose revenue caps limiting the annual volume of sales of naglazyme 
to the extent that these caps are significantly below actual demand  our future revenues and gross margins may be adversely affected 
we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments 
however  future price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our current and future products  which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
government health care reform could increase our costs  and would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
our industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business  operations or financial results 
the ppaca is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the us  primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the medicaid program 
several provisions of the new law  which have varying effective dates  may affect us and will likely increase certain of our costs 
for example  the medicaid rebate rate was increased and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in medicaid managed care organizations 
among other things  the ppaca also expands the b drug discount program excluding orphan drugs  including the creation of new penalties for non compliance  includes a discount on brand name drugs for medicare part d participants in the coverage gap  or donut hole  and imposes a new fee on certain manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs excluding orphan drugs under certain conditions 
the law also revised the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes  which could increase the amount of the medicaid drug 
table of contents rebates paid to states 
substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been added  which may require us to modify our business practices with health care practitioners 
for example  beginning in  drug manufacturers will be required to report information on payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals  as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year 
failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties 
although the statute requires reporting by march  of payments and other transfers of value made in calendar year  the cms has issued a final rule that will go into effect in april and will require manufacturers to begin collecting required information on august  with the first reports due march  the reforms imposed by the new law will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry  however  the full effects of the ppaca cannot be known until these provisions are implemented and the cms and other federal and state agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance 
moreover  in the coming years  additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products or product candidates 
we will continue to evaluate the ppaca  as amended  the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the ppaca by federal agencies  as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and that may potentially have an impact on our business over time 
the cost of implementing more detailed record keeping systems and otherwise complying with these regulations could substantially increase our costs 
the changes to the way our products are reimbursed by the cms could reduce our revenues 
both of these situations could adversely affect our results of operations 
we face credit risks from customers that may adversely affect our results of operations 
our product sales to government owned or supported customers in various countries outside of the us are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices 
this has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average length of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding 
if significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of these governments or if government funding becomes unavailable  we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from these customers and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
if we are found in violation of federal or state fraud and abuse laws  we may be required to pay a penalty or be suspended from participation in federal or state health care programs  which may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operation 
we are subject to various federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws  including anti kickback laws  false claims laws and laws related to ensuring compliance 
the federal health care program anti kickback statute makes it illegal for any person  including a pharmaceutical company  to knowingly and willfully offer  solicit  pay or receive any remuneration  directly or indirectly  in exchange for or to induce the referral of business  including the purchase  order or prescription of a particular drug  for which payment may be made under federal health care programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
under federal government regulations  certain arrangements  or safe harbors  are deemed not to violate the federal anti kickback statute 
however  the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly  and practices that involve remuneration not intended to induce prescribing  purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor 
our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti kickback liability  although we seek to comply with these safe harbors 
violations of the anti kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment  criminal fines  civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs 
federal and state false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to have a false claim paid 
in addition  certain marketing practices  including off label promotion  may also violate false claims laws 
under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  we 
table of contents also are prohibited from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program  including private payers  or knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items or services 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer s products from reimbursement under government programs  criminal fines and imprisonment 
many states have adopted laws similar to the federal anti kickback statute  some of which apply to referral of patients for health care services reimbursed by any source  not just governmental payers 
in addition  the state of california and several other states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with both the april office of inspector general compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers and the phrma code on interactions with healthcare professionals 
neither the government nor the courts have provided definitive guidance on the application of some of these laws to our business 
law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing these laws  and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws 
while we believe we have structured our business arrangements to comply with these laws  it is possible that the government could allege violations of  or convict us of violating  these laws 
if we are found in violation of one of these laws  we are required to pay a penalty or are suspended or excluded from participation in federal or state health care programs and our business  financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected 
we conduct a significant amount of our sales and operations outside of the us  which subjects us to additional business risks that could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
a significant portion of the sales of aldurazyme and naglazyme and all of the sales of firdapse are generated from countries other than the united states 
additionally  we have operations in several european countries  brazil  other latin american countries  turkey and asia 
we expect that we will continue to expand our international operations in the future 
international operations inherently subject us to a number of risks and uncertainties  including changes in international regulatory and compliance requirements that could restrict our ability to manufacture  market and sell our products  political and economic instability  diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the us  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  difficulty in staffing and managing international operations  differing labor regulations and business practices  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws  changes in international medical reimbursement policies and programs  financial risks such as longer payment cycles  difficulty collecting accounts receivable and exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and regulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors and service providers activities that may fall within the purview of the foreign corrupt practices act 
any of these factors may  individually or as a group  have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents as we continue to expand our existing international operations  we may encounter new risks 
for example  as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions  we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies 
if we are not successful in developing and maintaining these relationships  we may not be able to grow sales in these geographic regions 
these or other similar risks could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology  we may not be able to compete as effectively 
where appropriate  we seek patent protection for certain aspects of our technology 
patent protection may not be available for some of the products we are developing 
if we must spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our patents  designing around patents held by others or licensing  potentially for large fees  patents or other proprietary rights held by others  our business and financial prospects may be harmed 
the patent positions of biopharmaceutical products are complex and uncertain 
the scope and extent of patent protection for some of our products and product candidates are particularly uncertain because key information on some of our product candidates has existed in the public domain for many years 
the composition and genetic sequences of animal and or human versions of naglazyme  aldurazyme  and many of our product candidates have been published and are believed to be in the public domain 
the chemical structure of bh the active ingredient in kuvan and  dap the active ingredient in firdapse have also been published 
publication of this information may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to our products and product candidates  including without limitation composition of matter patents  which are generally believed to offer the strongest patent protection 
we own or have licensed patents and patent applications related to naglazyme  kuvan  aldurazyme and firdapse and certain of our product candidates  including vimizim 
however  these patents and patent applications do not ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons  including without limitation the following with respect to pending patent applications  unless and until actually issued  the protective value of these applications is impossible to determine 
we do not know whether our patent applications will result in issued patents 
competitors may interfere with our patent process in a variety of ways 
competitors may claim that they invented the claimed invention prior to us or that they filed their application for a patent on a claimed invention before we did 
competitors may also claim that we are infringing on their patents and therefore we cannot practice our technology 
competitors may also contest our patents by showing the patent examiner or a court that the invention was not original  was not novel or was obvious  for example 
in litigation  a competitor could claim that our issued patents are not valid or are unenforceable for a number of reasons 
if a court agrees  we would not be able to enforce that patent 
we have no meaningful experience with competitors interfering with or challenging the validity or enforceability of our patents or patent applications 
enforcing patents is expensive and may absorb significant time of our management 
management would spend less time and resources on developing products  which could increase our operating expenses and delay product programs 
we may not have the financial ability to sustain a patent infringement action  or it may not be financially reasonable to do so 
receipt of a patent may not provide much  if any  practical protection 
for example  if we receive a patent with a narrow scope  then it will be easier for competitors to design products that do not infringe on our patent the recently enacted america invents act  which reformed certain patent laws in the us  may create additional uncertainty 
among the significant changes are switching from a first to invent system to a first to file system  and the implementation of new procedures that permit competitors to challenge our patents in the us patent office after grant 

table of contents in addition  competitors may also seek intellectual property protection for their technology 
due to the amount of intellectual property in our field of technology  we cannot be certain that we do not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or that we will not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors granted or created in the future 
for example  if a patent holder believes our product infringes their patent  the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection for our technology 
if someone else claims we infringe their intellectual property  we would face a number of issues  including the following defending a lawsuit  which takes significant time and resources and can be very expensive 
if a court decides that our product infringes a competitor s intellectual property  we may have to pay substantial damages 
with respect to patents  in addition to requiring us to pay substantial damages  a court may prohibit us from making  selling  offering to sell  importing or using our product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us 
the patent holder is not required to grant us a license 
if a license is available  it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
for example  we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents and patent applications 
we may need to redesign our product so it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
redesigning our product so it does not infringe the intellectual property rights of competitors may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time 
it is also unclear whether our trade secrets are adequately protected 
our employees  consultants or contractors may unintentionally or willfully disclose trade secrets to competitors 
enforcing a claim that someone else illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets  as with patent litigation  is expensive and time consuming  requires significant resources and the outcome is unpredictable 
in addition  courts outside the us are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge  methods and know how  in which case we would not be able to enforce our trade secret rights against such competitors 
we may also support and collaborate in research conducted by government organizations  hospitals  universities or other educational institutions 
these research partners may be unwilling to grant us any exclusive rights to technology or products derived from these collaborations 
if we do not obtain required licenses or rights  we could encounter delays in our product development efforts while we attempt to design around other patents or may be prohibited from making  using  importing  offering to sell or selling products requiring these licenses or rights 
there is also a risk that disputes may arise as to the rights to technology or products developed in collaboration with other parties 
if we are not able to resolve such disputes and obtain the licenses or rights we need  we may not be able to develop or market our products 
if our manufacturing  marketing and sales agreement mms agreement with genzyme were terminated  we could be prevented from continuing to commercialize aldurazyme or our ability to successfully commercialize aldurazyme would be delayed or diminished 
either party may terminate the manufacturing  marketing and sales agreement mms agreement  between genzyme and us related to aldurazyme for specified reasons  including if the other party is in material breach of the mms  has experienced a change of control  as such term is defined in the mms agreement  or has declared bankruptcy and also is in breach of the mms 
although we are not currently in breach of the mms  there is a risk that either party could breach the mms in the future 
either party may also terminate the mms upon one year prior written notice for any reason 
if the mms agreement is terminated for breach  the breaching party will transfer its interest in biomarin genzyme llc  or the llc  to the non breaching party  and the non breaching party will pay a specified buyout 
table of contents amount for the breaching party s interest in aldurazyme and in the llc 
if we are the breaching party  we would lose our rights to aldurazyme and the related intellectual property and regulatory approvals 
if the mms agreement is terminated without cause  the non terminating party would have the option  exercisable for one year  to buy out the terminating party s interest in aldurazyme and in the llc at a specified buyout amount 
if such option is not exercised  all rights to aldurazyme will be sold and the llc will be dissolved 
in the event of termination of the buyout option without exercise by the non terminating party as described above  all right and title to aldurazyme is to be sold to the highest bidder  with the proceeds to be split between genzyme and us in accordance with our percentage interest in the llc 
if the mms agreement is terminated by either party because the other party declared bankruptcy  the terminating party would be obligated to buy out the other party and would obtain all rights to aldurazyme exclusively 
if the mms agreement is terminated by a party because the other party experienced a change of control  the terminating party shall notify the other party  the offeree  of its intent to buy out the offeree s interest in aldurazyme and the llc for a stated amount set by the terminating party at its discretion 
the offeree must then either accept this offer or agree to buy the terminating party s interest in aldurazyme and the llc on those same terms 
the party who buys out the other party would then have exclusive worldwide rights to aldurazyme 
the amended and restated collaboration agreement between us and genzyme will automatically terminate upon the effective date of the termination of the mms agreement and may not be terminated independently from the mms agreement 
if we were obligated  or given the option  to buy out genzyme s interest in aldurazyme and the llc  and thereby gain exclusive rights to aldurazyme  we may not have sufficient funds to do so and we may not be able to obtain the financing to do so 
if we fail to buy out genzyme s interest  we may be held in breach of the agreement and may lose any claim to the rights to aldurazyme and the related intellectual property and regulatory approvals 
we would then effectively be prohibited from developing and commercializing aldurazyme 
if this happened  not only would our product revenues decrease  but our share price would also decline 
based on our strategic alliance with merck serono  unless merck serono opts in to the peg pal program  we will not realize any cost sharing for the development expenses  development milestones  or royalties for ex us sales 
in may  we entered into an agreement with merck serono for the further development and commercialization of kuvan and any other product containing r bh and peg pal for pku 
pursuant to that agreement  we received development milestones on kuvan and receive royalties on sales by merck serono 
additionally  we may be entitled to development milestones and royalties related to peg pal 
however  merck serono has opted out of the peg pal development program 
unless and until it elects to opt in  it is not obligated to pay any of the milestones related to the program or to reimburse us for any of the development costs 
additionally  even though merck serono has opted out  we do not have any right to commercialize peg pal outside of the us and japan or to grant anyone else such rights 
merck serono may elect to opt in at any time 
if merck serono opts in to the peg pal development program before the unblinding of the first phase trial for peg pal  it must pay of the phase costs incurred prior to the opt in and the  phase initiation milestone  if the trial has started 
if it opts in after unblinding of the first phase trial for peg pal  it must pay of the phase costs incurred prior to the opt in and the  phase initiation milestone 
additionally  in all cases after it opts in to the peg pal development program  merck serono would be obligated to pay one half of future development costs under the agreement and any further milestones due under the agreement 
if merck serono does not opt in  it will not have the right to use any of the clinical or other independently developed data 
we cannot determine when or if merck serono will opt in to the peg pal development program 
if merck serono does not opt in  we will not receive any milestones under the agreement nor will there be any sales outside of the us or japan generating revenue from royalties or otherwise 

table of contents if we fail to compete successfully with respect to acquisitions  joint ventures or other collaboration opportunities  we may be limited in our ability to develop new products and to continue to expand our product pipeline 
our competitors compete with us to attract organizations for acquisitions  joint ventures  licensing arrangements or other collaborations 
to date  several of our product programs have been acquired through acquisitions  such as bmn and bmn and several of our product programs have been developed through licensing or collaborative arrangements  such as naglazyme  aldurazyme  kuvan and firdapse 
these collaborations include licensing proprietary technology from  and other relationships with  academic research institutions 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to identify additional opportunities and to successfully enter into partnering or acquisition agreements for those opportunities 
if our competitors successfully enter into partnering arrangements or license agreements with academic research institutions  we will then be precluded from pursuing those specific opportunities 
since each of these opportunities is unique  we may not be able to find a substitute 
several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have already established themselves in the field of genetic diseases 
these companies have already begun many drug development programs  some of which may target diseases that we are also targeting  and have already entered into partnering and licensing arrangements with academic research institutions  reducing the pool of available opportunities 
universities and public and private research institutions also compete with us 
while these organizations primarily have educational or basic research objectives  they may develop proprietary technology and acquire patents that we may need for the development of our product candidates 
we will attempt to license this proprietary technology  if available 
these licenses may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to compete successfully with respect to acquisitions  joint venture and other collaboration opportunities  we may be limited in our ability to develop new products and to continue to expand our product pipeline 
if generic manufacturers use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic versions of kuvan  our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected 
the hatch waxman act permits the fda to approve abbreviated new drug applications  or andas  for generic versions of branded drugs 
we refer to this process as the anda process 
the anda process permits competitor companies to obtain marketing approval for a drug with the same active ingredient for the same uses but does not generally require the conduct and submission of clinical efficacy studies for that product 
in place of such clinical studies  an anda applicant usually needs only to submit data demonstrating that its product is bioequivalent to the branded product based on pharmacokinetic studies 
pursuant to the hatch waxman act  companies were able to file an anda application for the active ingredient in kuvan at any time after december at present  we have no information that any other party has filed or has conducted the bioequivalency study necessary to file an anda for kuvan 
the hatch waxman act requires an applicant for a drug that relies  at least in part  on our data regarding the safety and efficacy of kuvan  to notify us of their application and potential infringement of our patents listed in the fda s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations orange book 
upon receipt of a notice alleging that our patents listed in the orange book are invalid or not infringed by the proposed competitor product paragraph iv notice  we would have days to bring a patent infringement suit in federal district court against the company seeking approval for its product 
the discovery  trial and appeals process in such suits can take several years 
if we commence such a suit alleging infringement of one or more of our orange book listed patents within days from receipt of the paragraph iv notice  the hatch waxman act provides a month stay on the fda s approval of the competitor s application 
if the litigation is resolved in favor of the applicant or the challenged patent expires during the month stay period  the stay is lifted and the fda s review of the application may be completed 
such litigation is often time consuming  costly and may result in competition if such patent s are not upheld or if the competitor does not infringe such patent s 
however  generic versions of kuvan would be prohibited until the expiration of orphan drug exclusivity in december or june if we receive pediatric exclusivity 

table of contents the filing of an anda application in respect to kuvan could have an adverse impact on our stock price and litigation to enforce our patents is likely to cost a substantial amount and require significant management attention 
if the patents covering kuvan were not upheld in litigation or if the generic competitor is found to not infringe these patents  the resulting generic competition following the expiration of orphan exclusivity would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 
if we do not achieve our projected development goals in the timeframes we announce and expect  the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
for planning purposes  we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific  clinical  regulatory and other product development goals  which we sometimes refer to as milestones 
these milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings 
from time to time  we publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones 
all of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions 
the actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates  in many cases for reasons beyond our control 
if we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced  the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and  as a result  our stock price may decline 
we depend upon our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees 
our future growth and success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract  retain  manage and motivate our employees 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results 
because of the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business  we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
in particular  the loss of one or more of our senior executive officers could be detrimental to us if we do not have an adequate succession plan or if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner 
while our senior executive officers are parties to employment agreements with us  these agreements do not guarantee that they will remain employed with us in the future 
in addition  in many cases  these agreements do not restrict our senior executive officers ability to compete with us after their employment is terminated 
the competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense  and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit 
due to this intense competition  we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel 
if we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts  our business may be harmed 
our success depends on our ability to manage our growth 
product candidates that we are currently developing or may acquire in the future may be intended for patient populations that are significantly larger than any of mps i  mps vi  pku or lems 
in order to continue development and marketing of these products  if approved  we will need to significantly expand our operations 
to manage expansion effectively  we need to continue to develop and improve our research and development capabilities  manufacturing and quality capacities  sales and marketing capabilities  financial and administrative systems and standard processes for global operations 
our staff  financial resources  systems  procedures or controls may be inadequate to support our operations and may increase our exposure to regulatory and corruption risks and our management may be unable to manage successfully future market opportunities or our relationships with customers and other third parties 

table of contents changes in methods of treatment of disease could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect revenues 
even if our drug products are approved  if doctors elect a course of treatment which does not include our drug products  this decision would reduce demand for our drug products and adversely affect revenues 
for example  if gene therapy becomes widely used as a treatment of genetic diseases  the use of enzyme replacement therapy  such as naglazyme and aldurazyme in mps diseases  could be greatly reduced 
changes in treatment method can be caused by the introduction of other companies products or the development of new technologies or surgical procedures which may not directly compete with ours  but which have the effect of changing how doctors decide to treat a disease 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial liabilities 
we are exposed to the potential product liability risks inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals 
we maintain insurance against product liability lawsuits for commercial sale of our products and for the clinical trials of our product candidates 
pharmaceutical companies must balance the cost of insurance with the level of coverage based on estimates of potential liability 
historically  the potential liability associated with product liability lawsuits for pharmaceutical products has been unpredictable 
although we believe that our current insurance is a reasonable estimate of our potential liability and represents a commercially reasonable balancing of the level of coverage as compared to the cost of the insurance  we may be subject to claims in connection with our clinical trials and commercial use of naglazyme  kuvan  aldurazyme and firdapse  or our clinical trials for peg pal  vimizim  bmn  bmn or bmn for which our insurance coverage may not be adequate 
the product liability insurance we will need to obtain in connection with the commercial sales of our product candidates if and when they receive regulatory approval may be unavailable in meaningful amounts or at a reasonable cost 
in addition  while we continue to take what we believe are appropriate precautions  we may be unable to avoid significant liability if any product liability lawsuit is brought against us 
if we are the subject of a successful product liability claim that exceeds the limits of any insurance coverage we obtain  we may incur substantial charges that would adversely affect our earnings and require the commitment of capital resources that might otherwise be available for the development and commercialization of our product programs 
we rely significantly on information technology and any failure  inadequacy  interruption or security lapse of that technology  including any cybersecurity incidents  could harm our ability to operate our business effectively 
we rely significantly on our information technology and manufacturing infrastructure to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports  to manufacture and ship products to customers and to timely invoice them 
any failure  inadequacy  or interruption of that infrastructure or security lapse of that technology  including cybersecurity incidents could harm our ability to operate our business effectively 
our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports  to manufacture and ship our products to customers and timely invoice them depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning  production management  and other information systems 
cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include  but are not limited to  malicious software  attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems  misappropriation of our confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data 
cybersecurity incidents resulting in the failure of our enterprise resource planning system  production management or other systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems  or a breach in security or other unauthorized access of these systems  may affect our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports  and result in delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations 
a breach in security  unauthorized access resulting in misappropriation  theft  or sabotage with respect to our proprietary and confidential information  including research or clinical data could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure  problem or breach  all of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our business is affected by macroeconomic conditions 
various macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business and the results of our operations and financial condition  including changes in inflation  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and overall economic conditions and uncertainties  including those resulting from the current and future conditions in the global financial markets 
for instance  if inflation or other factors were to significantly increase our business costs  it may not be feasible to pass through price increases on to our customers due to the process by which health care providers are reimbursed for our products by the government 
interest rates  the liquidity of the credit markets and the volatility of the capital markets could also affect the value of our investments and our ability to liquidate our investments in order to fund our operations 
we purchase or enter into a variety of financial instruments and transactions  including investments in commercial paper  the extension of credit to corporations  institutions and governments and hedging contracts 
if any of the issuers or counter parties to these instruments were to default on their obligations  it could materially reduce the value of the transaction and adversely affect our cash flows 
for the year ended december   approximately of our net product revenues were from the southern european countries of italy  spain  portugal and greece 
approximately of our total accounts receivable as of december  related to such countries and we have included an allowance for doubtful accounts for certain accounts receivable from greece 
if the financial conditions of these countries continues to decline  a substantial portion of the receivables may be uncollectable  which would mean we would have to provide for additional allowances for doubtful accounts or cease selling products in these countries  either of which could adversely affect our results of operations 
additionally  if one or more of these countries were unable to purchase our products  our revenue would be adversely affected 
interest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of our customers distributors to purchase  pay for and effectively distribute our products 
similarly  these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our contract manufacturers  sole source or single source suppliers to remain in business or otherwise manufacture or supply product 
failure by any of them to remain a going concern could affect our ability to manufacture products 
risks related to ownership of our securities our stock price may be volatile  and an investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value 
our valuation and stock price since the beginning of trading after our initial public offering have had no meaningful relationship to current or historical earnings  asset values  book value or many other criteria based on conventional measures of stock value 
the market price of our common stock will fluctuate due to factors including product sales and profitability of naglazyme  aldurazyme  kuvan and firdapse  manufacture  supply or distribution of naglazyme  aldurazyme  kuvan and firdapse  progress of our product candidates through the regulatory process  results of clinical trials  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  government regulatory action affecting our product candidates or our competitors drug products in both the us and non us countries  developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights  general market conditions and fluctuations for the emerging growth and pharmaceutical market sectors  economic conditions in the us or abroad  
table of contents broad market fluctuations in the us  the eu or in other parts of the world  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  and changes in our assessments or financial estimates by securities analysts 
in the past  following periods of large price declines in the public market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against that company 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management s attention and resources  which would hurt our business 
any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
in addition  the current decline in the financial markets and related factors beyond our control  including the credit and mortgage crisis in the us and worldwide  may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult 
we are incorporated in delaware 
certain anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
our anti takeover provisions include provisions in our certificate of incorporation providing that stockholders meetings may only be called by our board of directors and provisions in our bylaws providing that the stockholders may not take action by written consent and requiring that stockholders that desire to nominate any person for election to our board of directors or to make any proposal with respect to business to be conducted at a meeting of our stockholders be submitted in appropriate form to our secretary within a specified period of time in advance of any such meeting 
additionally  our board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders  which would allow our board of directors to implement a stockholder rights plan without approval by our stockholders 
the rights of holders of our common stock are subject to the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless  among other possibilities  our board of directors approves the transaction 
our board of directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company 
also  under applicable delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future

overview we develop and commercialize innovative biopharmaceuticals for serious diseases and medical conditions 
we select product candidates for diseases and conditions that represent a significant unmet medical need  have well understood biology and provide an opportunity to be first to market or offer a significant benefit over existing products 
key components of our results of operations include the following in millions years ended december  total net product revenues cost of sales research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense intangible asset amortization and contingent consideration provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss stock based compensation expense see results of operations below for a discussion of the detailed components and analysis of the amounts above 
our product portfolio is comprised of four approved products and multiple investigational product candidates 
our approved products are naglazyme galsulfase  kuvan sapropterin dihydrochloride  firdapse amifampridine phosphate and aldurazyme laronidase 
naglazyme  a recombinant form of n acetylgalactosamine sulfatase indicated for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis vi mps vi  a debilitating life threatening genetic disease for which no other drug treatment currently exists and is caused by the deficiency of arylsufatase b  received marketing approval in the us in may  in the eu in january and subsequently in other countries 
naglazyme net product revenues for the year ended december   totaled million  compared to million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and kuvan was granted marketing approval for the treatment of phenylketonuria pku in the us and in the eu in december and december  respectively 
our kuvan net product revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and in december  the european medicines agency granted marketing approval for firdapse  a proprietary form of diaminopyridine amifampridine phosphate  for the treatment of lambert eaton myasthenic syndrome lems 
we launched this product on a country by country basis in the eu beginning in april firdapse net product revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and aldurazyme laronidase  which was developed in collaboration with genzyme corporation genzyme  was approved in for marketing in the us  the eu and subsequently in other countries for patients with 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued mucopolysaccharidosis i mps i 
our aldurazyme net product revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million and million  respectively for the years ended december  and we are conducting clinical trials on several investigational product candidates for the treatment of various diseases including vimizim tm  formerly referred to as galns  an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type iv or morquio syndrome type a  a lysosomal storage disorder  peg pal  an enzyme substitution therapy for the treatment of pku  bmn  an enzyme replacement therapy for pompe disease  a glycogen storage disorder  bmn  an orally available poly adp ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with certain cancers  and bmn  a peptide therapeutic for the treatment of achondroplasia  the leading cause of dwarfism 
we are conducting preclinical development of several other product candidates for genetic and other metabolic diseases  including bmn for late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis lincl  a lysosomal storage disorder primarily affecting the brain 
cost of sales includes raw materials  personnel and facility and other costs associated with manufacturing naglazyme and aldurazyme at our production facility in novato  california 
cost of sales also includes third party manufacturing costs for the production of the active ingredient in kuvan and firdapse and third party production costs related to final formulation and packaging services for all products and cost of royalties payable to third parties for all products 
research and development includes costs associated with the research and development of product candidates and post marketing research commitments related to our approved products 
these costs primarily include preclinical and clinical studies  personnel and raw materials costs associated with manufacturing product candidates  quality control and assurance and regulatory costs 
selling  general and administrative expense primarily includes expenses associated with the commercialization of approved products and general and administrative costs to support our operations 
these expenses include product marketing and sales operations personnel  corporate facility operating expenses  information technology expenses and depreciation  and core corporate support functions  including human resources  finance and legal  and other external corporate costs such as insurance  legal fees and other professional services 
intangible asset amortization and contingent consideration includes amortization expense related to our finite lived intangible assets associated with marketing rights in the eu for firdapse  impairment losses if any on intangible assets and changes in the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration payable 
changes in fair value can result from changes in estimated probability adjustments  changes in estimated timing of when a milestone may be achieved  changes in assumed discount periods and rates and passage of time 
our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  we have historically financed our operations primarily through the issuance of common stock and convertible debt and by relying on equipment and other commercial financing 
we will be highly dependent on our net product revenue to supplement our current liquidity and fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
we may in the future elect to supplement this with further debt or equity offerings or commercial borrowing 
further  depending on market conditions  our

see financial position  liquidity and capital resources below for a further discussion of our liquidity and capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us and pursuant to the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our net income loss and affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for business combinations  contingent acquisition consideration payable  income taxes  long lived assets  revenue recognition and inventory have the greatest impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and in process research and development ipr d 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of contingent acquisition consideration payments utilizing a probability based income approach inclusive of an estimated discount rate 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired businesses and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing any contingent acquisition consideration issued or which may be issued and the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to the feasibility and timing of achievement of development  regulatory and commercial milestones  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products  and future expected cash flows from product sales 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
valuation of contingent acquisition consideration payable each period we reassess the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration payable associated with certain acquisitions and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as a reduction of contingent consideration expense 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration payable can result from changes in estimated probability adjustments with respect to regulatory approval  changes in the assumed timing of when milestones are likely to 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued be achieved and changes in assumed discount periods and rates 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions each period 
accordingly  future business and economic conditions  as well as changes in any of the assumptions described in the accounting for business combinations above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense that we record in any given period 
income taxes our consolidated balance sheets reflect net deferred tax assets that primarily represent the tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and credits and timing differences between book and tax recognition of certain revenue and expense items  net of a valuation allowance 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance for the amount that may not be realized 
each quarter  we evaluate the need to retain all or a portion of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
our evaluation considers historical earnings  estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
adjustments to the valuation allowance increase or decrease net income loss in the period such adjustments are made 
if our estimates require adjustments  it could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we continually review the adequacy and necessity of the valuation allowance 
if it is more likely than not that we would not realize the deferred tax benefits  then all or a portion of the valuation allowance may need to be re established 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets include our investment in biomarin genzyme llc  long term investments  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
we regularly review long lived assets for impairment 
the recoverability of our debt and equity investments is measured by available external market data  including quoted prices on public exchanges and other relevant information 
if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded for the amount that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the recoverability of long lived assets  other than goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and our long term investments is measured by comparing the asset s carrying amount to the expected undiscounted future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
determining whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount  and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
we use internal cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
the recoverability of the carrying value of buildings  leasehold improvements for our facilities and equipment will depend on the successful execution of our business initiatives and our ability to earn sufficient returns on our approved products and product candidates 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our fixed assets may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
based on management s current estimates  we expect to recover the carrying value of such assets 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we have recorded intangible assets  primarily related to ipr d  and goodwill as part of our recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in conjunction with our business combinations 
goodwill and intangible assets determined to be indefinite lived assets are not amortized  but are required to be reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we perform our annual impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the assets below their carrying values 
as of december   we had million of indefinite lived assets related to ipr d projects acquired from our business combinations 
we performed a qualitative assessment of events and circumstances that could affect the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
our assessment included consideration of various factors including costs associated with the underlying development programs  expected future revenues and cash flows  legal  regulatory and other entity specific factors that may have a significant impact on the inputs used to determine fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
based on our qualitative assessment  we determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets is less than their carrying amounts at december  at december   the net book value of our intangible assets whose lives are considered finite in nature was million 
these intangible assets are related to marketing rights for naglazyme  kuvan and firdapse  which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
we review these intangible assets for impairment when facts or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below their carrying amount 
as of december   we had goodwill of million resulting from our business combinations 
we currently operate in one business segment  the biopharmaceutical development and commercialization segment 
when reviewing goodwill for impairment  we assess whether goodwill should be allocated to operating levels lower than our single operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed for decision making purposes 
these lower levels are referred to as reporting units 
currently  we have identified only one reporting unit as per financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
we perform our annual impairment review of goodwill during the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our impairment review was based on a qualitative assessment including expected future revenues and cash flows  industry and market considerations and other entity specific factors that may have a significant impact on the fair value of our goodwill 
based on our qualitative assessment  we determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our goodwill is less than its carrying amount at december  revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with fasb asc subtopics asc  revenue recognition products and asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
our revenues consist of net product revenues from commercial products  revenues from our collaborative agreement with merck serono and other license and royalty revenues 
milestone payments are recognized in full when the related milestone performance goal is achieved and we have no future performance obligations related to that payment 
net product revenues we recognize net product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered to the customer  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer is reasonably assured 
product sales transactions are evidenced by customer purchase orders  customer contracts  invoices and or the related shipping documents 
amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities  which are primarily comprised of value added taxes related to naglazyme and firdapse sales in foreign jurisdictions  are presented on a net basis in our consolidated statements of operations  in that taxes billed to customers are not included as a component of net product revenues 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we receive a to royalty on worldwide net aldurazyme sales by genzyme depending on sales volume  which is included in net product revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
we recognize a portion of this amount as product transfer revenue when the product is released to genzyme because all of our performance obligations are fulfilled at that point and title to  and risk of loss for  the product has transferred to genzyme 
the product transfer revenue represents the fixed amount per unit of aldurazyme that genzyme is required to pay us if the product is unsold by genzyme 
the amount of product transfer revenue will eventually be deducted from the calculated royalty rate when the product is sold by genzyme 
we record the aldurazyme royalty revenue based on net sales information provided by genzyme and record product transfer revenue based on the fulfillment of genzyme purchase orders in accordance with the terms of the related agreements with genzyme and when the title and risk of loss for the product is transferred to genzyme 
as of december  and  accounts receivable included million and million  respectively  of unbilled accounts receivable related to net incremental aldurazyme product transfers to genzyme 
we sell naglazyme worldwide  kuvan in the us and canada and firdapse in the eu 
in the us  naglazyme and kuvan are generally sold to specialty pharmacies or end users  such as hospitals  which act as retailers 
we also sell kuvan to merck serono at a price near its manufacturing cost  and merck serono resells the product to end users outside the us  canada and japan 
the royalty earned from kuvan product sold by merck serono in the eu is included as a component of net product revenues in the period earned and approximates four percent 
outside the us  naglazyme and firdapse are sold to our authorized distributors or directly to government purchasers or hospitals  which act as the end users 
we record reserves for rebates payable under medicaid and other government programs as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenues are recorded 
our reserve calculations require estimates  including estimates of customer mix  to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates 
we update our estimates and assumptions each quarter and record any necessary adjustments to our reserves 
we record fees paid to distributors as a reduction of revenue 
we record allowances for product returns  if appropriate  as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
several factors are considered in determining whether an allowance for product returns is required  including market exclusivity of the products based on their orphan drug status  the patient population  the customers limited return rights and our experience with returns 
because of the pricing of our products  the limited number of patients and customers limited return rights  most naglazyme  kuvan and firdapse customers and retailers carry a limited inventory 
however  certain international customers  usually government entities  tend to purchase larger quantities of product less frequently 
although such buying patterns may result in revenue fluctuations from quarter to quarter  we have not experienced an increase in product returns and do not believe these buying patterns increase the risk of product returns 
we rely on historical return rates to estimate returns for our commercial products 
genzyme s contractual return rights for aldurazyme are limited to defective product 
based on these factors and the fact that we have not experienced significant product returns to date  management has concluded that product returns will be minimal 
in the future  if any of these factors and or the history of product returns changes  an allowance for product returns may be required 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the nature and amount of our current estimates of the applicable revenue dilution items that are currently applied to aggregate world wide gross sales of naglazyme  kuvan and firdapse to derive net sales are described in the table below 
revenue dilution item percentage of gross sales years ended december  description rebates rebates payable to state medicaid  other government programs and certain managed care providers distributor fees fees paid to authorized distributors cash discounts discounts offered to customers for prompt payment of accounts receivable total we maintain a policy to record allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million  compared to million as of december  royalty and license revenues royalty and license revenues includes royalties on net sales of products with which we have no direct involvement and is recognized based on data reported by licensees or sublicensees 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when the royalty amount is fixed or determinable based on information received from the sublicensee and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
due to the significant role we play in the operations of aldurazyme and kuvan  primarily the manufacturing and regulatory activities  as well as the rights and responsibilities to deliver the products to genzyme and merck serono  respectively  we elected not to classify the aldurazyme and kuvan royalties earned as other royalty revenues and instead to include them as a component of net product revenues 
inventory we value our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we determine the cost of inventory using the average cost method 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory that has become obsolete  or has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory quantities in excess of expected requirements 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are recognized as cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
inventories consist of currently marketed products and certain products awaiting regulatory approval 
in evaluating the recoverability of inventories produced in preparation for product launches  we consider the likelihood that revenue will be obtained from the future sale of the related inventory together with the status of the product within the regulatory approval process 
when regulatory approval and the likelihood of future revenues for a product candidate are less certain  the related manufacturing costs expensed as research and development expenses

the ipr d assets impaired were associated with the marketing rights for firdapse in the us the increase in the fair value of the contingent acquisition consideration payable was primarily attributed to increases in the assumed probability of achieving development milestones based on the current status of the related development programs

interest income we invest our cash  short term and long term investments in government and other high credit quality securities in order to limit default and market risk 
interest income totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reduction in interest income during  as compared to and was primarily due to lower market interest rates 
we expect that interest income will increase during as compared to due to higher cash and investment balances resulting from the net proceeds received from the sale of million shares of our common stock in june interest expense and debt conversion expense we incur interest expense on our convertible debt and our capital leases 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense was attributed to the early conversion of million and million in aggregate principal of our notes in september and november  respectively 
in connection with the early conversion of the notes  we recognized debt conversion expense of million and million in and  respectively 
we expect interest expense to decrease in  compared to as our senior subordinated convertible notes mature in march see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
provision for benefit from income taxes during the year ended december  we recognized an income tax benefit of million  compared to an income tax expense of million and an income tax benefit of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision for benefit from income taxes for and consisted of state  federal and foreign current tax expense of million and million  respectively 
the provision for benefit from income taxes also consisted of deferred tax expense related to the utilization of our

the benefit from income tax during consisted of foreign and state current tax expense and deferred tax benefit related to the release of million of our valuation allowance during see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the components of our provision for benefit from income taxes 
the consolidated us gaap loss includes all of our foreign subsidiaries 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we calculate our provision for benefit from income taxes on an entity by entity and jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as adjusted for differences between book basis income and tax basis income  which results in certain foreign entities being profitable and incurring foreign current income tax expense 
certain foreign entities incur significant amounts of research and development expense that results in significant losses that more than offset the income reported by the profitable foreign entities on a consolidated basis 
the majority of these material research and development losses are in foreign jurisdictions that do not have net operating loss carryforward provisions that result in deferred tax assets  which results in an effective tax rate of on approximately million of foreign net losses 
other foreign operations generated us gaap income of approximately million with an effective tax rate of approximately 
financial position  liquidity and capital resources we expect to fund our operations with our net product revenues from our commercial products  cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments supplemented by proceeds from equity or debt financings and loans or collaborative agreements with corporate partners  each to the extent necessary 
we expect our current cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments will meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months based on our current business plans 
this expectation could also change depending on how much we elect to spend on our development programs and for potential licenses and acquisitions of complementary technologies  products and companies 
in june  we sold million shares of our common stock at a price of per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement 
we received net cash proceeds of million from the public offering 
we will be highly dependent on our net product revenue to supplement our current liquidity and fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
we may in the future elect to supplement this with further debt or equity offerings or commercial borrowing 
we consider the unrepatriated cumulative earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to be invested indefinitely outside the us as of december   million of our million balance of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities was from foreign subsidiary operations and is intended to fund future foreign operations 
in managing our liquidity needs in the us  we do not rely on the unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds and we have not provided for us federal or state income taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings 
we are mindful that conditions in the current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals 
some of the factors that could affect our business include future changes to healthcare reform in the us  a continuation or worsening of global economic conditions  patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors  continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
we will continue to monitor these conditions and will adjust our business processes  as appropriate  to mitigate these risks to our business

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulted from net proceeds of million from the public offering of our common stock in june the increase in other current assets is primarily attributed to the increases in prepaid expenses  current deferred tax assets and short term restricted investments 
the restricted investments secure our irrevocable standby letter of credit obtained in connection with our new corporate facility lease agreements and certain other commercial arrangements 
the classification of the notes as a current liability from long term convertible debt was due to their maturity in march our product sales to government owned or government funded customers in certain southern european countries  including greece  spain  italy and portugal are subject to payment terms that are imposed by government authority 
because these customers are government owned or government funded  we may be impacted by declines in sovereign credit ratings or sovereign defaults in these countries 
a significant or further decline in sovereign credit ratings or a default in greece  or in other southern european countries  may decrease the likelihood that we will collect accounts receivable or may increase the discount rates and the length of time until receivables are collected  which could result in a negative impact to our operating results 
historically we have not experienced a significant level of uncollected receivables and have received continued payments from our more aged accounts 
we believe that the allowances for doubtful accounts for these countries are adequate based on our analysis of the specific business circumstances and expectations of collection for each of the underlying accounts in these countries 
as of december   approximately of our outstanding accounts receivable relate to such countries

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our investment in our product development programs and continued development of our existing commercial products has a major impact on our operating performance

this may increase our capital requirements  including costs associated with the commercialization of our products  additional clinical trials  investments in the manufacturing of naglazyme  aldurazyme  kuvan and firdapse  preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates  potential licenses and other acquisitions of complementary technologies  products and companies  and general corporate purposes 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to our ability to successfully market and sell naglazyme  kuvan and firdapse  genzyme s ability to continue to successfully commercialize aldurazyme  the progress and success of our preclinical studies and clinical trials including studies and the manufacture of materials  the timing  number  size and scope of our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and the costs of post marketing studies which may be required by regulatory authorities  the time and cost necessary to develop commercial manufacturing processes  including quality systems  and to build or acquire manufacturing capabilities  the progress of research programs carried out by us  our possible achievement of milestones identified in our purchase agreements with the former stockholders of lead  zystor  huxley and zacharon that trigger related milestone payments  any changes made to  or new developments in  our existing collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships or any new collaborative  licensing and other commercial relationships that we may establish  and whether our convertible debt is converted to common stock in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
by policy  we place our investments with highly rated credit issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our investment policy  we seek to improve the safety and likelihood of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
as of december   our investment portfolio did not include any investments with significant exposure to the subprime mortgage market issues or the european debt crisis 
based on our investment portfolio and interest rates at december   we believe that a basis point decrease in interest rates could result in a potential loss in fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately million 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio 
however  we will not recognize such gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations unless the investments are sold 
the table below presents the carrying value of our cash and investment portfolio  which approximates fair value at december  in millions carrying value cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments total of cash and cash equivalents are invested in money market instruments and in cash 
of short term investments are invested in corporate debt securities  in certificates of deposit  in us government agency securities and in corporate equity securities 
of long term investments are invested in corporate debt securities  in certificates of deposit and in us government agency securities 
our debt obligations consist of our convertible debt  which carries a fixed interest rate and  as a result  we are not exposed to interest rate market risk on our convertible debt 
the carrying value of our convertible debt approximates its fair value at december  foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily in euros and brazilian real 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates of the euro from sales of our products in europe 
our operating expenses in the united kingdom  other european countries and brazil are in british pounds  euros and real  respectively  which serve to mitigate a portion of the exposure related to the above mentioned revenue in both markets 
we hedge a portion of our net position in assets and liabilities denominated in euros using forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
we also hedge a percentage of our forecasted euro denominated revenue and operating expenses denominated in brazilian reais with forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
our hedging policy is designed to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we mitigate 
table of contents short term foreign currency exposure resulting from currency fluctuations by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
these contracts have maturities of less than months 
as of december   we had forward foreign currency exchange contracts to sell approximately million euros and to buy approximately million brazilian reais 
as of december   our outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts had a net fair value of million  of which million was included in other current assets  million was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and million was included in other long term liabilities on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the counterparties to these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks  which minimizes the risk of counterparty nonperformance 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses denominated in local currencies in europe 
instead  we believe that a natural hedge exists  in that local currency revenue substantially offsets the local currency operating expenses 
we regularly review our hedging program and may  as part of this review  make changes to the program 
based on our overall foreign currency exchange rate exposures at december   we believe that a near term fluctuation of the us dollar exchange rate could result in a potential change in the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive assets and investments by approximately million 
we expect to enter into new transactions based in foreign currencies that could be impacted by changes in exchange rates 
at december   we had cash of approximately million denominated in foreign currencies  which represented approximately of the total cash and investment portfolio 
as a result  our cash and investment portfolio is subject to limited amounts of foreign currency exchange rate risk
