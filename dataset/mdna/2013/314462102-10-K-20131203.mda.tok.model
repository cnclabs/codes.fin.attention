because fc s primary usages are for disease prevention and family planning  the public health sector is the company s main market 
within the public health sector  various organizations supply critical products such as fc  at no cost or low cost  to those who need but cannot afford to buy such products for themselves 
fc is currently available in countries 
a significant number of countries with the highest demand potential are in the developing world 
the incidence of hiv aids  other stis and unwanted pregnancy in these countries represents a remarkable potential for significant sales of a product that benefits some of the world s most underprivileged people 
however  conditions in these countries can be volatile and result in unpredictable delays in program development  tender applications and processing orders 
the company has a relatively small customer base  with a limited number of customers who generally purchase in large quantities 
over the past few years  major customers have included large global agencies  such as unfpa and usaid 
other customers include ministries of health or other governmental agencies  which either purchase directly or via in country distributors  and ngos 
purchasing patterns vary significantly from one customer to another  and may reflect factors other than simple demand 
for example  some governmental agencies purchase through a formal procurement process in which a tender request for bid is issued for either a specific or a maximum unit quantity 
tenders also define the other elements required for a qualified bid submission such as product specifications  regulatory approvals  clearance by who  unit pricing and delivery timetable 
bidders have a limited period of time in which to submit bids 
bids are subjected to an evaluation process which is intended to conclude with a tender award to the successful bidder 
the entire tender process  from publication to award  may take many months to complete 
administrative issues  politics  bureaucracy  process errors  changes in leadership  funding priorities and or other pressures may delay or derail the process and affect the purchasing patterns of public sector customers 
as a result  the company may experience significant quarter to quarter sales variations due to the timing and shipment of large orders 
in the past few years  the company s business model  which includes high gross margins  modest capital expenditures and low expense requirements compared to production volumes  has permitted the company to sustain profitable operations without debt and maintain dividend payments during periods of delayed orders 
continuation of these accomplishments in the future periods will be contingent on a number of factors  including the degree and period of sales volatility and on the strength of global demand for the company s product 
during fiscal  the company unit shipments  revenues and net income were adversely affected by bureaucratic delays and other timing issues involving the receipt and shipment of large orders from brazil and rsa 
significant orders for both countries were received in the first quarter of fiscal the million unit order received for shipment to brazil was the largest order in the company s history 
receipt of these orders positively impacted fiscal results 
during the eight year period from fiscal through fiscal  the average annual compound growth rate of unit sales of female condoms fc and fc was percent 
details of the quarterly unit sales for the last five fiscal years are listed below period october december january march april june july september total revenues 
most of the company revenues are derived from sales of fc  and are recognized upon shipment of the product to its customers 
since fiscal  revenue is also being derived from licensing the company s intellectual property to its exclusive distributor in india  hll 
hll is authorized to manufacture fc at hll facility in kochi  india for sale in india 
hll is the company exclusive distributor in india and the company receives a royalty based on the number of units sold by hll in india 
such revenue appears in net revenues on the audited consolidated statements of income for the years ended september   and  and is recognized in the period in which the sale is made by hll 
the company strategy is to further develop a global market and distribution network for its product by maintaining relationships with public health sector groups and completing partnership arrangements with companies with the necessary marketing and financial resources and local market expertise 
the company s most significant customers are either global public health sector agencies or those who facilitate their purchases and or distribution of fc for use in hiv aids prevention and or family planning 
the company three largest customers currently are unfpa  usaid  sekunjalo 
unfpa accounted for percent of unit sales in fiscal  percent of unit sales in fiscal  and percent of unit sales in fiscal usaid accounted for less than percent of unit sales in fiscal  percent of unit sales in fiscal  and percent of unit sales in fiscal sekunjalo accounted for less than percent of unit sales in fiscal  percent of unit sales in and less than percent of unit sales in fiscal no other single customer accounted for more than percent of unit sales in fiscal  or in the us  fc is sold to city and state public health clinics as well as to not for profit organizations such as planned parenthood 
because the company manufactures fc in a leased facility located in malaysia  a portion of the company operating costs are denominated in foreign currencies 
while a material portion of the company future sales are likely to be in foreign markets  all sales are denominated in the us dollar 
effective october   the company s us and malaysia subsidiaries adopted the us dollar as their functional currency  further reducing the company s foreign currency risk 
expenses 
the company manufactures fc at its facility located in selangor de  malaysia 
the company cost of sales consists primarily of direct material costs  direct labor costs and indirect production and distribution costs 
direct material costs include raw materials used to make the fc  principally a nitrile polymer 
indirect product costs include logistics  quality control and maintenance expenses  as well as costs for helium  nitrogen  electricity and other utilities 
all of the key components for the manufacture of fc are essentially available from multiple sources 
the company operating expenses include costs for promotion  education and training relating to fc during the london summit  the company announced a program to support the london summit goal to provide contraceptives to an additional million women by this program includes a plan for the company to invest up to million over the period from through in reproductive health and hiv aids prevention education and training in collaboration with global agencies 
such investment in education and training may increase the company operating expenses in future periods  although the company has not set a specific timetable for any such increased spending on education and training 
the company believes that increased spending on education and training will expand the market for fc in connection with the london summit  the company implemented a volume purchasing incentive program to award major public sector purchasers with fc equal to percent of their total annual units purchased  at no cost to such purchasers 
the initial entitlement to percent no cost product was based on fc units purchased during the initial six month period from the start of the program on july  through december  future entitlements to percent no cost product will be determined on a calendar year basis beginning with the year ending december  the company will reserve for the cost of the percent no cost product as a cost of sales  which may affect the company gross margin 
the company believes that such no cost product awards will assist in educating and training  making new users aware of fc and providing an incentive for increased unit sale volumes from major purchasers

the following table includes information relating to our contractual obligations as of september  in future fiscal years contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations total critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and use assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures 
critical accounting estimates include the deferred income tax valuation allowance 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company files separate income tax returns for its foreign subsidiaries 
asc topic requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are also provided for carryforwards for income tax purposes 
in addition  the amount of any future tax benefits is reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent such benefits are not expected to be realized 
the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company completes a detailed analysis of its deferred income tax valuation allowances on an annual basis or more frequently if information comes to our attention that would indicate that a revision to its estimates is necessary 
in evaluating the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence on a country by country basis  including past operating results and forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  management makes assumptions to forecast us federal and state  us and malaysia operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of the future taxable income in each tax jurisdiction  and are consistent with the forecasts used to manage the company s business 
it should be noted that the company realized significant losses through on a consolidated basis 
since fiscal  the company has consistently generated taxable income on a consolidated basis  providing a reasonable future period in which the company can reasonably expect to generate taxable income 
in management s analysis to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset to recognize  management projected future taxable income for the subsequent ten years for each tax jurisdiction 
although management uses the best information available  it is reasonably possible that the estimates used by the company will be materially different from the actual results 
these differences could have a material effect on the company future results of operations and financial condition 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations  state taxes  certain benefits realized related to equity based awards  and utilization of nol carryforwards 
the effective tax rates  before considering the reversal of the valuation allowance  were percent  percent and percent for fiscal   and  respectively 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws  regulations  and accounting principles 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
impact of inflation and changing prices although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation  the company has experienced increased costs of product  supplies  salaries and benefits  and increased general and administrative expenses 
the company has  where possible  increased selling prices to offset such increases in costs 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company exposure to market risk is limited to fluctuations in raw material commodity prices  particularly the nitrile polymer used to manufacture fc  and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the company foreign operations 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes or to hedge risk and holds no derivative financial instruments which would expose it to significant market risk 
effective october   the company uk subsidiary and malaysia subsidiary each adopted the us dollar as its functional currency 
the consistent use of the us dollar as the functional currency across the company reduces its foreign currency risk and stabilizes its operating results 
the company currently has no significant exposure to interest rate risk 
the company has a line of credit with heartland bank  consisting of a revolving note for up to million with borrowings limited to a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory 
outstanding borrowings under the line of credit will incur interest at a rate equal to a base rate plus percent
