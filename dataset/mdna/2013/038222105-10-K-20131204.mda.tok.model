applied s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips  flat panel liquid crystal and other displays  solar pv cells and modules  and other electronic devices 
these customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components 
applied operates in four reportable segments silicon systems group  applied global services  display  and energy and environmental solutions 
a summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of factors that could affect applied s operations is set forth under risk factors in part i  item a  which is incorporated herein by reference 
product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in north america  europe and asia 
applied s equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force 
applied s results historically have been driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors  which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products 
each of applied s businesses is subject to highly cyclical industry conditions  as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips  display technologies  solar pvs and other electronic devices  as well as other factors  such as global economic and market conditions  and technological advances in fabrication processes 
in light of this cyclicality  applied results can vary significantly year over year  as well as quarter over quarter 
as a result of these conditions and the changing global economic environment  there were significant fluctuations in applied s quarterly new orders and net sales within and across the last three fiscal years 
applied strategic priorities for fiscal include growing its presence in wafer fab equipment and display  reducing its losses in the solar business  and expanding its overall available market 
as part of this strategy  the company has implemented initiatives to decrease overhead spending and further reduce solar operating expense to fund research and development in semiconductor and other key product areas 
in semiconductor equipment  applied intends to continue investment in mm  mm and other semiconductor technologies to strengthen the product pipeline and investment in the enhancement of technical relationships with customers 
on september   applied entered into an agreement with tokyo electron limited tel  a japanese corporation and global supplier of semiconductor  flat panel display and photovoltaic panel production equipment  to effect a combination of their respective businesses into a new combined company 
the combination is expected to bring together leading technologies and products and create an expanded set of capabilities in precision materials engineering and patterning 
the closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions  including approval by applied s and tel s stockholders and regulatory approvals

fiscal  and each contained weeks 
mobility continued to be the largest influence on semiconductor industry spending during fiscal the first half of fiscal was characterized by strong demand for semiconductor equipment from foundry customers driven by demand for advanced mobile chips 
in the second half of the year  demand from foundry customers softened  reflecting seasonal consumer buying patterns for mobility products  while demand from memory and logic customers improved 
mobility also represents a significant driver of display industry spending  and demand for mobile display equipment remained strong during fiscal fiscal was also characterized by a recovery in demand for tv manufacturing equipment compared to weak industry levels in the prior year  resulting from higher consumer demand in emerging markets and for larger lcd tvs 
in solar  while end market growth continued  investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the industry 
applied expects the mobility trend to remain the main growth driver for the semiconductor industry  and in turn for the silicon systems group  in applied also expects the overall display investment cycle to continue into  while solar equipment demand is expected to remain soft in fiscal was characterized by significant fluctuations in demand for semiconductor equipment  coupled with an extremely weak market environment for display and solar equipment 
applied completed its acquisition of varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc varian in the first quarter of fiscal mobility was the greatest influence on semiconductor industry spending in fiscal consumer buying patterns for electronic products  combined with growing semiconductor customer concentration  contributed to a seasonality effect  with relatively strong demand for semiconductor equipment led by foundry customers during the first half of fiscal  followed by softening of demand from foundry and logic customers in the third quarter of fiscal and further declines across all categories of wafer fab equipment customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal low investment levels for display equipment continued in fiscal due to decreased capacity requirements for larger flat panel televisions as conditions in this industry remained challenging 
as with the semiconductor industry  demand for mobility products  such as smartphones and tablets  significantly influenced equipment spending in the display industry 
in the solar industry  fiscal was characterized by continued excess manufacturing capacity  which led to significantly reduced demand for crystalline silicon c si equipment  as well as weaker operating performance and outlook by the fourth quarter 

table of contents the first nine months of fiscal reflected increased demand across all segments except display  due to improved global economic and industry conditions  although demand softened for semiconductor  display and solar equipment in the last quarter of fiscal towards the end of fiscal  each of the semiconductor  display and solar industries was negatively impacted by uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment  and the display and solar equipment industries were also negatively impacted by overcapacity 
new orders new orders by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows change over change over in millions  except percentages silicon systems group applied global services display energy and environmental solutions total new orders for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  primarily due to a recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment and increased demand in semiconductor equipment  partially offset by lower demand for service products  as well as depressed demand for c si solar equipment due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry 
new orders for the silicon systems group and applied global services continued to comprise a majority of applied consolidated total new orders 
new orders for fiscal decreased for all segments compared to the same periods in the prior year  mostly due to the lower demand for c si solar and display equipment due to excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry and the continued down cycle in the display industry  respectively  partially offset by the addition of orders attributable to varian of billion 
the silicon systems group and applied global services relative share of total new orders increased compared to the prior year as a result of the addition of varian and the sharp decrease in orders in display and energy and environmental solutions 
new orders by geographic region  determined by the product shipment destination specified by the customer  were as follows change over change over in millions  except percentages taiwan china korea japan southeast asia asia pacific united states europe total the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment in fiscal led to the increase in new orders from customers in china 
the change in the composition of new orders from customers in taiwan  korea  japan and the united states was primarily related to changes in customer demand for semiconductor equipment 
the decrease in new orders from customers in china in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflected reduced investments by solar manufacturers due to industry overcapacity 

table of contents changes in backlog during fiscal and were as follows in millions beginning balance new orders net sales net adjustments ending balance backlog consists of orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next months  or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized  and contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next months 
applied s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods  due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders 
approximately percent of the backlog as of the end of fiscal is anticipated to be shipped within the first two quarters of fiscal applied s backlog was billion at october  compared to billion at october  backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal and totaled million  primarily consisting of customer cancellations and financial debookings 
backlog by reportable segment as of october  and october  was as follows change over in millions  except percentages silicon systems group applied global services display energy and environmental solutions total backlog increased in fiscal from fiscal across all segments 
the increase in backlog was primarily due to increases in demand from memory customers and the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal approximately percent of net sales in the silicon systems group  applied s largest business segment  were for orders received and shipped within the quarter  down from percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents net sales net sales by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows change over change over in millions  except percentages silicon systems group applied global services display energy and environmental solutions total for fiscal as compared to fiscal  net sales in display increased  reflecting the recovery of tv manufacturing equipment investment  while net sales across all other segments decreased 
the decrease primarily reflected continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry and lower investments in semiconductor equipment  spares and services 
the silicon systems group remains the largest contributor of net sales 
for fiscal as compared to fiscal  net sales in the silicon systems group increased slightly while net sales across all other segments decreased 
the decreases reflected lower investments in c si solar and lcd tv equipment  partially offset by sales attributable to varian 
net sales by geographic region  determined by the location of customers facilities to which products were shipped  were as follows change over change over in millions  except percentages taiwan china korea japan southeast asia asia pacific united states europe total the increase in net sales from customers in china in fiscal was primarily due to the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment 
the changes in net sales from customers in korea  the united states and taiwan were primarily related to changes in customer demand for semiconductor equipment 
the decrease in net sales from customers in china in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflected decreased investments in the solar and display industries due to overcapacity 

table of contents gross margin gross margins for the past three fiscal years were as follows change over over in millions  except percentages gross margin gross margin of net sales points points non gaap adjusted results non gaap adjusted gross margin non gaap adjusted gross margin of net sales points points reconciliations of non gaap adjusted measures are presented under non gaap adjusted results below 
gross margin and non gaap adjusted gross margin decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal reflecting lower sales 
gross margin percent and non gaap adjusted gross margin percent increased in fiscal compared to fiscal despite lower sales  due primarily to lower inventory charges  a favorable product mix  and material cost reductions 
gross margin and non gaap adjusted gross margin decreased in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to changes in segment and customer mix  additional inventory charges  and lower net sales  partially offset by sales for a thin film solar production line in fiscal  for which inventory was fully reserved prior to fiscal in addition  the decrease in gross margin in fiscal was also affected by inventory fair value adjustments and intangible asset amortization associated with purchase accounting  mostly associated with the acquisition of varian  which amounted to million in fiscal gross margin and non gaap adjusted gross margin during fiscal  and included million  million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
research  development and engineering research  development and engineering rd e expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows change over over in millions research  development and engineering applied s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides 
applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd e to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced designs 
applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in rd e in order to continue to offer new products and technologies 
development cycles range from to months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product  which typically has a shorter development cycle  or a new product  which typically has a longer development cycle 
most of applied s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies  materials and processes 
in certain instances  applied acquires technologies  either in existing or new product areas  to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market 

table of contents in fiscal  applied increased its investment in mm product development 
applied developed new applications for its epitaxial technology  enabling industry transition to nmos transistors at the nm node and enabling chip makers to build faster devices and deliver next generation mobile computing power 
applied also released its next generation defect review and classification technology that delivers industry leading resolution used for finding  identifying and analyzing defects in d finfet and high aspect ratio structures at nm nodes 
applied also continued to invest in the development of mm wafer fabrication equipment 
rd e expenses increased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
as part of its growth strategy  applied has taken certain actions  including workforce reductions and reprioritization of existing spend  to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical r d programs in current and new markets  with a focus on semiconductor technologies 
the increase in rd e for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to rd e expenses related to varian of approximately million and continued investment in the development of equipment for smaller linewidths and mm wafers  partially offset by lower investments in solar r d projects and the cessation of light emitting diode led equipment development 
rd e expense during fiscal  and included million  million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
marketing and selling marketing and selling expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows change over over in millions marketing and selling the decrease in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to savings from restructuring programs along with a reduction in the bad debt provision during the year as a result of lower risk exposures in display and solar customers 
the increase in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to marketing and selling expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of varian 
marketing and selling expenses during fiscal  and included million  million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
general and administrative general and administrative g a expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows change over over in millions general and administrative the decrease in g a for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the absence of certain costs incurred during fiscal associated with the acquisition of varian  savings from restructuring programs  and lower share based compensation expense  partially offset by costs incurred associated with the business combination with tel 
the increase in g a expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to acquisition related costs and other g a expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of varian  partially offset by lower variable compensation and savings associated with temporary shutdowns

table of contents impairment of goodwill during fiscal  the solar industry faced increasing challenges  including manufacturing overcapacity and weak operating performance and outlook  which led to a deterioration in market conditions 
as a result  applied performed a two step goodwill impairment test and recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in its energy and environmental solutions segment 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the solar industry experienced further deterioration of market conditions associated with continued manufacturing overcapacity and weaker operating performance and outlook  resulting in increased uncertainties regarding the timing and nature of a recovery in solar capital equipment expenditures 
taking these factors into account  applied reassessed its financial outlook for the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit and consequently reevaluated the recoverability of this reporting unit goodwill 
applied performed the two step impairment test and concluded that the energy and environmental solutions reporting unit carrying value exceeded its fair value 
based on applied analyses  the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit 
as a result  in the second quarter of fiscal  applied recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  representing all of the remaining goodwill for this reporting unit 
applied also performed an impairment test for long lived assets associated with the reporting unit and determined that the majority of intangible assets were impaired mostly due to the lower long term revenue and profitability outlook associated with products related to these intangible assets 
accordingly  during the second quarter of fiscal  applied recorded an impairment charge of million related to these intangible assets  which was the amount by which the carrying value of these intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair value  based on discounted projected cash flows 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  applied also performed a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for the remaining reporting units for impairment and determined that it was more likely than not that each of the silicon systems group  applied global services  and display reporting units fair values exceeded its respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test for these reporting units 
the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment 
in the event of future changes in business conditions  applied will be required to reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses 
if the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates  a material impairment charge may result at that time

impairments of strategic investments equity investments in privately held companies are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are periodically assessed for other than temporary impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred 
if applied determines that an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the investment will be written down to its estimated fair value based on available information  such as pricing in recent rounds of financing  current cash positions  earnings and cash flow forecasts  recent operational performance and any other readily available market data 
during fiscal  and  applied determined that certain of its equity investments held in privately held companies were other than temporarily impaired and  accordingly  recognized impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively 
interest expense and interest and other income  net interest expense and interest and other income  net for the past three fiscal years were as follows change over over in millions interest expense interest and other income  net interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes issued in june to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition of varian 
interest expense remained flat during fiscal from the prior year  while interest expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal mainly due to the full year of interest expense incurred on the senior unsecured notes in fiscal interest income primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments and realized gains on sale of securities 
interest and other income was essentially flat for fiscal from fiscal the decrease in interest income in fiscal from fiscal is due to lower cash and investment balances after completion of the acquisition of varian  decreased realized gains on investment securities  and lower interest rates 

table of contents income taxes income tax expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows change over over in millions  except percentages provision for income taxes effective income tax rate points points the effective tax rate for fiscal was significantly lower than the rate for fiscal due primarily to the geographic composition of applied pre tax income  lower nondeductible goodwill impairment charges  and reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit retroactive to its expiration in december these reductions were partially offset by a lower benefit in fiscal from the us federal domestic production deduction  which was limited by us federal taxable income 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was significantly higher than the rate for fiscal due primarily to nondeductible goodwill impairment charges in fiscal and the fiscal benefit from the december reinstatement of the us r d tax credit retroactive to its expiration in december segment information applied reports financial results in four segments silicon systems group  applied global services  display  and energy and environmental solutions 
a description of the products and services  as well as financial data  for each reportable segment can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

non cash charges included depreciation  amortization  share based compensation  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring and asset impairments and deferred income taxes 
the decrease in cash from operating activities from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from a higher proportion of shipments near the end of the year  while inventories grew to support projected customer demand 
applied did not utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal and applied utilized programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers of million in fiscal discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors  including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements

the days sales outstanding in fiscal included a favorable impact from the timing of the sale of thin film production line during the year 
days inventory outstanding decreased slightly from fiscal to fiscal  while days payable outstanding increased 
the increase in days payable outstanding primarily reflected an increase in accounts payable due to increase in inventory purchases near the end of the period to support projected customer demand

for details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks  see off balance sheet arrangements below 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either applied or its subsidiaries 
as of october   the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately million 
applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
applied does not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements 
applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide  including overdraft arrangements  issuance of bank guarantees  and letters of credit

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes applied s contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations interest expense associated with long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities represents applied s agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied s a outstanding purchase orders for goods and services  and b contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods 
other long term liabilities do not include noncurrent income taxes payable  noncurrent deferred income taxes payable and certain tax related liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments 
in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above  applied has certain tax obligations 
gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as non current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of october   the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million 
increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 
interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions were million as of october  and million as of october   which were classified as a noncurrent liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
at this time  applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and  accordingly  such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates applied could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as applied s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties include those discussed in part i  item a  risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that applied s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of applied s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements 
in addition  applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables 
judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units 
moreover  judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period 
while changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement  any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition  which could have a material effect on applied s financial condition and results of operations 
warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product  current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 
applied s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates  material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as applied s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on historical experience  credit evaluations  specific customer collection history and any customer specific issues applied has identified 
changes in circumstances  such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to applied or its payment trends  may require applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to applied  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital 
management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment  especially in emerging markets 
a severe decline in market conditions could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective tax rate as required 
if actual results differ from these estimates  applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities  net operating losses and tax credit carryovers 
deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that applied s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets  net of existing valuation allowance 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied s expectations could have a material impact on applied s results of operations and financial condition 
non gaap adjusted results management uses non gaap adjusted results to evaluate operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes 
applied believes these measures enhance investors ability to review the company s business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this period s results with prior periods 
the non gaap adjusted results presented below exclude the impact of the following  where applicable certain acquisition related costs  restructuring charges and any associated adjustments  impairments of assets  goodwill  or investments  gain or loss on sale of facilities  and certain tax items 
these non gaap adjusted measures are not in accordance with gaap and may differ from non gaap methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies 
the presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk applied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances 
applied s investment portfolio includes fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately billion at october  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
based on applied s investment portfolio at october   an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately million 
while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio  applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporary 
at october   the carrying amount of debt issued by applied was billion with an estimated fair value of billion 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of applied s debt issuances of approximately million at october  certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies  such as japanese yen  euro  israeli shekel  taiwanese dollar and swiss franc 
applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next months 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in certain cases  applied uses derivatives to hedge specific foreign currency exposures 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as part of an overall risk management strategy  applied purchased foreign exchange option contracts to limit its foreign exchange risk associated with the announced business combination with tel in the event there is a significant weakening in the japanese yen as compared to the us dollar 
the derivatives used to hedge the currency exposure did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
at october   the fair value of the foreign exchange currency option contracts was approximately million 
applied recognized a loss of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to such contracts 
changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen would impact applied consolidated financial statements 
the future maximum loss exposure on this option contract is generally limited to its fair value as of the most recent balance sheet date
