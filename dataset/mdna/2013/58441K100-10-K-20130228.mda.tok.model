item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company will require a significant amount of cash to service its indebtedness 
this cash may not be readily available to the company 
the company s ability to make payments on  or repay or refinance  its indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend largely upon the company s future operating performance 
the company s future performance  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 
the company cannot be certain that it will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in amounts sufficient to enable the company to pay its current indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
the company is subject to risks of decreased advertising revenues and potentially adverse effects of emerging technologies 
the company s revenue is primarily driven by advertiser spending  which is generally lower in the first and third fiscal quarters as consumer activity slows during those periods 
additionally  broadcast advertising revenue tends to be higher in even numbered years  when both political and olympics advertising occurs 
the level of advertising revenue across its television stations is also dependent on a variety of factors including economic conditions and demographics of the company s markets which are concentrated in the southeast  the popularity of programming offered by the company s stations  variability in pricing for local and national advertising  the volume of political advertising which may be constrained by campaign finance laws  competition from other television broadcasters  websites and other media outlets  and the financial health of large advertisers  particularly those in the automotive industry 
television broadcasting is a mature industry 
as a result  the company s revenues are being challenged by new  often times web based  competitors who have differing business models 
new and emerging consumer devices  such as web connected tablet computers and smart phones  provide alternate platforms for the providers of video programming to compete with television broadcast service for viewers and for advertising revenue 
in addition  technologies that allow viewers to digitally record  store  skip and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials and  as a result  lower the company s advertising revenues 
the company s future success depends upon its ability to adjust its operations to this changing business environment 
for example  the company is attempting to capitalize on a new standard that allows broadcast stations to broadcast video to mobile devices 
if the company is unable to adapt successfully  the company s existing revenues and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
the company may be unable to sufficiently reduce operating costs to offset potential revenue declines 
the company previously has taken measures to manage its operating costs by reducing headcount  freezing or limiting certain employee benefits  and implementing other cost control measures across the company 
in addition  during and following the disposition of its newspapers in  the company took aggressive action to reduce its corporate overhead costs 
while these expense reductions have not significantly impacted the company s ability to deliver news to its local markets or serve its advertisers  future expense reductions may diminish the quality of the company s products and limit its ability to generate revenue 
if further reductions in employee compensation and benefits are necessary  the company may not be able to attract and retain key employees 
furthermore  significant portions of the company s expenses are fixed in nature and may not be easily reduced if revenue declines occur which may adversely affect the company s operating results 
as a television broadcaster  the company is highly regulated and continuation of its operations requires that it retain or renew a variety of government approvals 
the fcc extensively regulates the ownership  operation and sale of broadcast television stations  including those licensed to the company 
the communications act of the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest 
among other things  the fcc assigns frequency bands  determines stations locations and operating parameters  issues  renews  revokes and modifies station licenses  regulates and limits changes in ownership or control of station licenses  regulates equipment used by stations  regulates station employment practices  regulates certain program content and commercial matters in children s programming  has the authority to impose penalties for violations of its rules or the communications act  and imposes annual fees on stations 
reference should be made to the communications act  as well as to the fcc s rules  public notices and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast television stations 
congress and the fcc have under consideration  and in the future may adopt  new laws  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect  directly or indirectly  the operation  ownership transferability and profitability of the company s television stations and affect the ability of the company to acquire additional stations 
in addition to the matters noted above  these may include  for example  spectrum use fees  reallocation of portions of the television broadcast spectrum to other uses or reductions in the amount of spectrum allotted to television stations  restrictions on the ability of same market television stations to engage in shared services  joint sales  or other cooperative arrangements to reduce operating costs  political advertising rates  potential restrictions on the advertising of certain products such as alcoholic beverages  program content  increased fines for rule violations and ownership rule changes 
for example  the fcc is considering in its ongoing quadrennial review of ownership rules whether to restrict the ability of same market stations to enter into joint sales  shared services  news sharing and other cooperative agreements 
the company s present joint sales and shared services arrangements with another television station in augusta  georgia  could be affected by such a change 
uncertainty about media ownership regulations and adverse economic conditions has from time to time dampened the acquisition market 
as mentioned above  the fcc has an ongoing proceeding to revise its newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule and to consider changes to other ownership rules 
due to its relationship with berkshire hathaway  which purchased certain of the company s newspaper assets through its world media subsidiary  the company continues to hold cross ownership interests subject to waiver in several of the markets in which it operates and could be significantly affected by the outcome of these proceedings 
additionally  a rejection or reconsideration of license renewals and waivers by the fcc could have a material  adverse effect on the company s business 
typically  the fcc begins processing renewal applications over the last month of the renewal term 
since the television license renewal cycle commenced in june  however  the fcc has held up almost all television renewal applications filed by affiliates of the major networks pending fcc disposition of a backlog of indecency and other complaints against the networks programming 
the company filed all of its applications for renewal in a timely manner prior to the applicable expiration dates and expects its applications will be approved as the fcc works through its backlog 
in these circumstances  the communications act provides that the company may continue to operate under its broadcast licenses pending final action on its renewal applications 
the company s operating results are dependent in part on the success of programming aired by the company s television stations  which depends in part upon factors beyond the company s control 
the company s advertising revenues depend in part on the success of the company s local  network and syndicated programming 
the company makes significant commitments to acquire rights to television programs under multi year agreements 
whether these programs succeed depends upon unpredictable factors such as audience preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
if a particular program is not popular  it may not be possible to sell enough advertising to cover the program s cost 
in some instances  the company may have to replace or cancel programs before fully amortizing their costs and  as a result  may have impairments that increase operating costs 
in addition  fcc rules affect the network affiliate relationship 
among other things  these rules require network affiliation agreements to i prohibit networks from requiring affiliates to clear time previously scheduled for other use  ii permit an affiliate to preempt network programs it believes are unsuitable for its audience and iii permit affiliates to substitute programs believed to be of greater local or national importance than network programming 
in  the fcc resolved a petition to review certain of these rules by clarifying its limitations on the extent to which the networks can exert control over the operations of their affiliates 
the non renewal or termination of a network affiliation agreement or a change in network affiliations could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company periodically renegotiates its major network affiliation agreements 
for example  the company recently entered into a new network affiliation agreement with nbc that extends through december  the company s network affiliation agreement with abc expires in june  and its network affiliation agreements with cbs begin to expire in december the company anticipates that it will be required to pay commercially reasonable fees to abc and cbs once it renews the respective affiliation agreements 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s affiliation agreements will be renewed  or what effect  if any  these renewals may have on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
if any of the company s stations cease to maintain affiliation agreements with networks for any reason  the company would need to find alternative sources of programming  which may be less attractive and more expensive 
a change in network affiliation in a given television market may have many short and long term consequences  depending upon the circumstances surrounding the change 
potential short term consequences include a increased marketing costs and increased internal operating costs  which can vary widely depending on the amount of marketing required to educate the audience regarding the change and to maintain the station s viewing audience  b short term loss of market share or slower market growth due to advertiser uncertainty about the switch  c costs of building a new or larger news operation  d other increases in station programming costs  if necessary  and e the cost of equipment needed to conform the station s programming  equipment and logos to the new network affiliation 
long term consequences are more difficult to assess  due to the cyclical nature of each of the major networks share of the audience that changes from year to year with programs coming to the end of their production cycle  and the audience acceptance of new programs in the future and the fact that national network audience ratings do not necessarily indicate how a network s programming may fare in a particular market 
the circumstances that may surround a network affiliation switch cause uncertainty as to the actual costs that will be incurred by the company  and if these costs are significant  the switch could have a material adverse impact on the income the company derives from the affected station 
in addition  syndication agreements are licenses to broadcast programs that are produced by production companies 
such programming can form a significant component of a station s programming schedule 
syndication agreements are subject to cancellation  which may affect a station s programming schedule  and the company cannot be certain that it will continue to be able to acquire rights to syndicated programs once its current contracts for these programs end 
if the company is unable to secure or maintain carriage of its television stations signals over cable  telecommunication video and or direct broadcast satellite systems  the company s television stations may not be able to compete effectively 
pursuant to fcc rules  local television stations may elect every three years to either require cable and or direct broadcast satellite operators to carry the stations signals or enter into retransmission consent agreements for carriage 
failure to reach timely retransmission consent agreements with the relevant operators may harm the company s business 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to agree on acceptable terms  which could lead to reduction in its revenue from cable and satellite retransmission consent agreements 
if the company is unable to reach retransmission consent agreements with cable companies  satellite providers and telecommunication providers for the carriage of its stations signals  the company could lose revenues and audience share 
the company is renegotiating retransmission agreements with cable providers as current contracts expire  and these renewals will most likely result in increased retransmission revenues for the company 
however  higher retransmission revenues may be offset  in whole or in part  by increased expenses in the form of additional network fees as described above 
the fcc is considering possible mechanisms for spectrum reallocation that could affect the spectrum for the company s stations and adversely impact the company s ability to compete 
the fcc is authorized to conduct a reverse auction at which television broadcast licensees could submit bids to receive compensation for relinquishing all or a portion of their rights in the television spectrum of their full service and class a stations 
a licensee could bid to relinquish its channel entirely  relocate to a different channel band uhf to vhf or relinquish its channel and share a different channel with another broadcaster 
broadcasters choosing to share a channel would retain must carry rights on cable systems 
under the law  the fcc may hold only one reverse auction 
concurrently with the reverse auction or after its completion  the fcc would conduct a forward auction of the newly freed spectrum 
the fcc must complete both auctions by even if a television licensee does not participate in the reverse auction  the fcc nevertheless may require that it relocate its station to another channel or make technical changes to facilitate repacking the band 
the fcc will have a billion fund to compensate broadcasters and cable systems for the reasonable costs of repacking 
the legislation limits the ability of broadcasters to challenge fcc repacking decisions by denying a licensee the right to a hearing before the fcc modifies its license  a right that the communications act otherwise would provide 
the fcc issued a new rule making proposal on october   to develop rules to govern incentive auctions for television broadcast spectrum  re auction of any reclaimed spectrum to wireless broadband providers and the repacking of broadcasters on the channels remaining dedicated to television broadcasting after the auction 
the fcc has indicated that it hopes to complete this rule making in mid so that the auctions can take place early in  but it could require several years to develop rules for the auctions that congress has authorized 
changes in the fcc  the administration and the congress could affect this schedule and the ultimate shape of the auctions in ways that cannot now be predicted 
the company further cannot predict the form of any final rules that the fcc may adopt for television spectrum reallocation or whether the rules ultimately adopted would have any adverse effect upon the company s ability to compete 
additionally  the company cannot predict whether the fcc or the congress might adopt even more stringent requirements or incentives to abandon current spectrum if the initiatives now being reviewed are adopted and implemented but do not have the desired result of freeing what the agency deems to be sufficient spectrum for wireless broadband use 
the company s class b stockholders exercise control over most matters submitted for a vote of stockholders 
the company s articles of incorporation provide for the holders of the class a common stock voting separately and as a class to elect of the board of directors and for the holders of the class b common stock to elect the balance 
the company s class b stockholders have the sole right to vote on all other matters submitted for a vote of stockholders  except as required by law and except with respect to limited matters specifically set forth in the articles of incorporation 
class b common stock can be converted into class a common stock on a share for share basis at the option of the holder 
j 
stewart bryan iii  chairman of the board of directors  controls approximately of the company s class b common stock and therefore has the power to determine the outcome of class b director elections and approve significant corporate transactions 
the interests of mr 
bryan and other class b stockholders may differ from those of other stockholders 
mr 
bryan also has the ability to prevent a change of control of the company  regardless of whether holders of class a common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
as a result  the market price of the company s a common stock could be adversely affected 
berkshire hathaway and its affiliates may have the ability to exercise influence over the company 
as of december   berkshire hathaway owned approximately of the class a common stock of the company and had recommended an individual to serve as a director of the company in accordance with the shareholder agreement 
berkshire hathaway also is the counterparty to the company s term loan and revolving line of credit  as described in note of item in the third quarter of  the company sold most of its newspapers and associated websites to world media enterprises  a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway 
the company considers berkshire hathaway and affiliates to be related parties 
by virtue of its investment in the company s class a common stock  its position in nearly half of the company s outstanding debt and the company s appointment of a director nominated by berkshire hathaway  berkshire hathaway may have the ability to exercise influence over the company s activities 
the interests of berkshire hathaway may differ from those of other stockholders 
furthermore  berkshire hathaway s investment in the company s stock means the company continues to be impacted by the fcc s newspaper broadcast ownership rules which may limit its ability to acquire additional stations or could potentially require it to divest of certain stations 
the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans are currently underfunded 
a declining stock market and lower interest rates could affect the value of its retirement plan assets and increase the company s postretirement obligations 
the company has a qualified non contributory defined benefit retirement plan covering substantially all employees hired before january   which as of december   was underfunded in an amount equal to million 
the company also has non contributory unfunded supplemental executive retirement and erisa excess plans which supplement the coverage available to certain executives 
there is also an unfunded plan that provides certain health and life insurance benefits to retired employees who were hired prior to and a retirement medical savings account established as of january  although the company has frozen participation and benefits under these plans  two significant elements in determining the company s pension expense are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used in projecting obligations 
large declines in the stock market such as those seen in and lower discount rates such as those seen in increase the company s expense and may necessitate higher cash contributions to the pension plan 
the company may experience lost advertising  damaged property and increased expense due to natural disasters 
due to the company s concentration in the southeastern united states  its operations are particularly susceptible to tropical storms  tornadoes and hurricanes 
these storms can cause lost advertising revenue and higher expenses if the company s geographic markets are threatened or are directly in the path of the storms 
additionally  the company s properties could experience severe damage in the event of a major storm 
impairment of the value of the company s intangible assets is possible  depending on future operating results and the value of its stock 
the company periodically evaluates its intangible assets to determine if their carrying values are recoverable 
factors which influence the evaluation include expected future operating results including assumptions around revenue growth  compensation levels  capital expenditures and discount rates  the company s stock price and the market for buying selling media assets 
if the carrying value is no longer deemed to be recoverable  a charge to earnings may be necessary 
although those charges are non cash in nature and do not affect the company s operations  they could affect future reported results of operations and increase the company s stockholders deficit 
cybersecurity risks could affect the company s operating effectiveness 
the company uses computers in substantially all aspects of its business operations 
its revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products 
such use gives rise to cybersecurity risks such as business interruption  disclosure of nonpublic information and or decreased advertising revenues 
the company has systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents  and it maintains insurance coverage to mitigate cyber related risks  however  depending on the nature of an incident  these protections may not be fully sufficient

overview media general ended as a vastly different company than it entered the year 
at the beginning of  the company had a portfolio of newspapers  television stations and advertising services businesses and was in the process of refinancing its bank debt 
by the end of the year  the company had sold all of its newspapers and disposed of its advertising services businesses 
the company also had entered into a new financing arrangement with an affiliate of berkshire hathaway which matures in and resulted in berkshire hathaway becoming a significant stockholder 
for a more detailed discussion surrounding the company s debt agreements  see the liquidity and capital resources section of this management s discussion analysis md a 
the company has transformed itself into a pure play broadcast television and digital media company 
it is focused on providing high quality local content in growth markets located primarily in the southeastern united states 
the company has streamlined its operations to align with its focus as a television broadcaster and is now organized on the basis of two geographic regions each consisting of nine network affiliated television stations 
during  the company aggressively added new newscasts and local variety shows aimed at specific consumer interests in its markets 
this additional local content attracts new viewers and advertisers while reducing syndicated programming costs 
the company also is installing a new content management system for its websites and mobile platforms to provide a single workflow for its newsrooms 
advertising sales comprise the majority of the company s revenues 
the distribution of advertising revenues in the united states continues to shift among numerous established media  as well as many relatively new contenders  resulting in intense competition 
the company faces challenges from other broadcasters  from increasing digital competition  from cautious advertisers and from the cyclical nature of certain advertising which translates into the relative absence of political and olympics advertising for television stations in odd numbered years 
the role of digital media continues to evolve at a rapid pace  and the company believes it is well positioned both strategically and structurally to capitalize on emerging opportunities 
retransmission fees also represent a growing component of overall revenues 
the years and were a period of precarious economic recovery and  at times  weak consumer confidence and muted advertiser spending 
the company took steps during this period to manage its costs in light of its revenue opportunities  including implementing a day furlough for most employees in in contrast  was an exceptionally strong year for the company  as it benefited from record political spending  the super bowl and olympics on its nbc stations and overall growth in local and national advertising  particularly in the automotive sector 
the company entered into a new network affiliation agreement with nbc in that expires at the end of this agreement ensures that the company s nbc stations maintain their primary source of programming along with special events such as the olympics 
under the agreement  the company is required  as it was previously  to make certain cash payments to nbc for inventory management and programming 
in addition  the renewed agreement requires that the company s nbc affiliates pay a variable fee which is dependent on subscriber counts and retransmission rates received by the company 
for further discussion of the nbc agreement  see the results of operations other section of this md a 
during and following the sale of its newspapers  the company streamlined its management structure and significantly reduced its corporate expense 
the company also consolidated its corporate headquarters facilities and has reduced its postretirement and postemployment obligations 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires that management make various estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses reported 
the company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if that estimate requires assumptions to be made about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and if changes in the estimate which are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the audit committee of the board of directors has reviewed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates 
while actual results could differ from accounting estimates  the company s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas intangible assets the company reviews the carrying values of both goodwill and other identified intangible assets  including fcc licenses  as of the first day of the fourth quarter each year  or earlier if events indicate an impairment may have arisen  utilizing qualitative analyses and discounted cash flow models and market based models  where necessary 
when evaluating goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment  the company first considers qualitative factors including but not limited to current macroeconomic conditions  the company s actual performance versus budgeted performance  key management changes and selling prices for broadcast companies 
when a quantitative test is deemed necessary  the company prepares discounted cash flow models which require significant management judgment with respect to revenue growth  compensation levels  capital expenditures  discount rates and long term growth rates for broadcast assets 
in addition  the preparation of market based models requires the collection of estimated peer company data as to revenues and ebitda  as well as an assessment of enterprise values by looking at stock prices and debt levels 
these key assumptions for both the discounted cash flow and market based models work in concert with one another 
changes to one variable may necessitate changes to other variables 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level  which the company considers to be its two operating segments each consisting of nine television stations and their associated websites divided geographically 
prior to performing a quantitative two step goodwill impairment test  the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the quantitative test is necessary 
in  the company determined that an annual quantitative test was not required 
the company performs its annual impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets ie  fcc licenses at the station level 
fifteen of the company s stations have fcc license carrying values 
in  the company early adopted a new accounting standard which allowed the company to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it was necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test on indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
quantitative impairment testing was deemed unnecessary for thirteen of these fifteen stations 
quantitative impairment testing was performed for the remaining two stations 
in both instances  the estimated fair values of the fcc licenses exceeded their carrying values 
as of the end of  the company s carrying value of fcc licenses was million 
the models the company uses to value fcc licenses are highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
since the estimated fair values that arise in both the discounted cash flow and market based models are subject to change based on the company s performance and stock prices  peer company performance and stock prices  overall market conditions  and the state of the credit markets  future impairment charges of both goodwill and fcc licenses are possible 
pension plans and postretirement benefits a determination of the liabilities and cost of the company s pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used in the company s pension and postretirement reporting are reviewed annually with independent actuaries and are compared with external benchmarks  historical trends and the company s own experience to determine that its assumptions are reasonable 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality rates health care cost trends retirement rates expected contributions a one percentage point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a change in pension expense for of approximately million 
a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have raised or lowered the plans expense by approximately thousand and would have changed the plans projected obligations by approximately million to million as of the end of the company has fully frozen all participation and benefits under its retirement plans 
self insurance liabilities the company self insures for certain medical and disability benefits  workers compensation costs  and automobile and general liability claims with specified stop loss provisions for high dollar claims 
the company estimates the liabilities for these items approximately million at december  based on historical experience and advice from actuaries and claim administrators 
actual claims experience as well as changes in health care cost trends could result in the company s eventual cost differing from this estimate 
income taxes the company files income tax returns with various state tax jurisdictions in addition to the internal revenue service and is regularly audited by both federal and state tax agencies 
from time to time  those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
the company has considered alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various tax agencies and does not anticipate any material impact on its earnings as a result of these audits 
the company maintains a reserve for uncertain tax positions  where the probability exceeds a more likely than not standard 
the reserve for uncertain tax positions was million at the end of both and the company records income tax expense using the liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the differing treatments of various items for financial reporting versus tax reporting purposes 
the company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the company ordinarily bases its estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates as well as expected future income 
however  the company was in a net deferred tax asset position at the end of both and and  although the company expects to utilize the underlying tax benefits  it could not assume future taxable income due to a cumulative book loss in recent years 
the company therefore established a valuation allowance 
due to the requirements of accounting interpretations related to the company s amortization of intangible assets for income tax purposes  the company anticipates recording an additional deferred tax valuation allowance of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the additional valuation allowance will be recorded as a non cash charge to income tax expense 
an explanation of this additional valuation allowance as well as a description of the situation and events that would alter it are described more fully in note and note of item of this form k 
significant changes in enacted federal and state tax laws or in expected future earnings could impact income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the valuation allowance 
summary management believes  given current facts and circumstances  supplemented by the expertise and concurrence of external resources  including actuaries  that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable and in accordance with gaap 
management further believes that the assumptions and estimates used in the financial statements  taken as a whole  represent the most appropriate choices from among reasonably possible alternatives and fairly present the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
management will continue to discuss key estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
results of operations net loss the company recorded net losses of million per share  million per share and million per share in  and  respectively 
the results from newspapers  blockdot  dealtaker  netinformer and its production services company are reflected as discontinued operations in all periods presented 
as discussed further below  the net loss in included million of losses related to the divestiture of discontinued operations and million of debt modification and extinguishment costs 
in addition to the dispositions  in january  the company sold the intellectual property and certain tangible assets of blockdot for a nominal amount  but did not sell blockdot s working capital or certain operating leases in dallas  texas 
in addition to the loss related to the divestiture already recorded  and because the space related to these leases will no longer be utilized by the company  the company expects to record a loss from discontinued operations in the first quarter of that could approach million 
the remainder of this discussion focuses only on results from continuing operations 
operating income was million  million and million in  and  respectively  and was driven primarily by higher political and olympic revenue in the even numbered years 
in  the operating income increase in excess of million was offset by a million rise in total interest expense due to higher interest rates on the company s new financing arrangement and by the previously mentioned debt modification costs of million 
in  operating income declined more than million as decreased operating costs resulting from a furlough program  and other cost containment measures could not mitigate the absence of political and olympic revenue 
interest expense was essentially even in and  although the company incurred million of debt modification and extinguishment costs in conjunction with its refinancing activities 
as a result of these forces  the company s loss from continuing operations was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
revenues revenues are grouped into five major categories local  national  political  cable satellite retransmission  and digital 
the following chart summarizes the total consolidated period over period changes in these select revenue categories change in market revenue by major category versus versus in thousands amount percent amount percent local gross national gross political nm cable satellite retransmission digital nm is not meaningful 
as illustrated in the previous chart  broadcast political advertising time sales are higher in even numbered years as a result of national and statewide political races which generate additional advertising dollars for the company 
political advertising  or its relative absence in odd numbered years  causes a certain cyclicality  as demonstrated in the following graph showing political advertising as a percentage of total television time sales 
record political time sales in were eleven times the prior year level due to an extended presidential primary race  the footprint of the company s television stations in four key presidential swing states and a fiercely contested senate race in massachusetts 
in  all revenue categories improved 
political advertising reflected higher spending by both presidential campaigns  by pacs and superpacs and in certain congressional primaries and senate races 
the company operates six television stations in the key presidential battleground states of florida  north carolina  ohio and virginia 
in the third quarter of the year  the company generated million of revenue at its eight nbc stations from the summer olympics  a significant driver of the robust growth in the local and national categories 
the super bowl also aired on the company s nbc stations in the first quarter and contributed million in related advertising revenues 
beyond event driven revenues  the company saw healthy growth in in the automotive  financial  medical and telecommunications categories 
retransmission revenues were higher as a result of renegotiated rates  following renewal in late of agreements for of the households in the company s markets 
digital advertising increases were due largely to local online advertising  which increased in in  local revenues were up million but were largely offset by declines in national advertising down million 
the absence of event driven advertising in was a factor in the decline as million in olympic revenues and nearly million in super bowl revenues which aired on fox in did not recur 
despite signs of firming in national broadcast transactional business in  national advertising revenues in reflected uncertainty related to a sputtering economic recovery and disruption of automotive advertising due to the tsunami in japan 
digital revenue rose by  led by an increase in local online advertising 
operating costs total operating costs increased in the primary driver was higher affiliate expenses which increased by more than million as a result of the new nbc agreement  employee compensation costs also contributed 
specifically  million of severance expense was incurred at corporate due primarily to the elimination of positions in the second half of additionally  the company implemented a furlough program in  which mandated that most employees take unpaid days 
the absence of the furlough program in increased operating costs by approximately million 
higher incentive based compensation as a result of the company s improved operating performance also contributed to the increase 
the impact of higher compensation costs was muted by fourth quarter gains of million  in aggregate  recorded at the corporate level and related to the company s postretirement and postemployment plans 
in  total operating costs decreased from a reduction in programming costs and the referenced furlough program were responsible for much of the decrease 
station production expenses increased in due in part to the absence of the furlough program 
however  higher network affiliate fees  partially offset by lower programming costs due in large part to the retirement of oprah winfrey and a shift toward more local programming were responsible for the majority of the increase 
in  station production expenses decreased as programming costs dropped by million  resulting from a shift by the company s stations to more locally produced content 
employee compensation costs were primarily responsible for a rise in station selling  general and administrative expenses in the absence of the furlough program  higher healthcare costs and increased commissions and sales incentives were all factors 
station selling  general and administrative expenses were essentially even in and salary decreases associated with the furlough program were offset by a rise in commissions related to local revenue increases and the return of a company match of employees k plan contributions 
corporate and other expenses as shown on the consolidated statement of operations dropped in the reductions included a non cash curtailment gain of more than million  resulting from former newspaper employees leaving the company s postretirement plans  and a million non cash gain resulting from using a third party to provide disability coverage for substantially all medicare eligible participants 
these gains were offset by a million increase in incentive compensation for both corporate and station management that was not present in the previous year and by million of corporate severance expense 
corporate expense excluding depreciation and amortization and severance decreased by during due to the referenced corporate staffing reduction  but also offset by the absence of furlough savings from this same furlough program also drove the decline in corporate and other expenses in depreciation and software amortization expense was down and in and  respectively  due to reduced capital spending in recent years 
amortization of intangible assets decreased by half in as certain assets reached the end of their amortization periods in the first quarter 
as a result of the corporate restructuring  the company has consolidated its operations in one of two headquarters buildings in richmond  virginia  the company wrote down the carrying value of the other building by million and recorded the loss in the loss gain related to fixed assets  net line on the consolidated statement of operations 
interest expense total interest expense including million of related party interest associated with the berkshire hathaway financing increased million in from the prior year 
the increased interest expense was due to higher interest rates as a result of the company s new financing arrangement and partially offset by a reduction in average debt outstanding 
interest expense in included non cash charges of million compared to million in this non cash interest expense represents accretion of discounts related to original issuance  warrants and certain fees that are amortized over the life of a loan 
non cash interest expense for also includes payment in kind pik interest of nearly million which was incurred between march and may under the company s previous credit facility 
interest expense decreased million in from due primarily to a million reduction in average debt outstanding and the remaining interest rate swaps maturing in the third quarter of income taxes the company s  and tax rates had an unusual relationship to pretax loss from continuing operations 
income tax expense in all three periods was heavily impacted by the presence of an additional valuation allowance million in and  and million in in connection with the tax amortization of the company s indefinite lived intangible assets that is not available to offset existing deferred tax assets termed a naked credit 
in  this non cash tax expense was partially offset by the tax benefit related to the maturity of the interest rate swaps and the resultant tax effect on other comprehensive loss 
in  the expense related to the naked credit was partially offset by tax benefits related to an additional net operating loss carryback refund and a favorable settlement of a state income tax issue 
as of december   and december   the company had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  recorded against its net deferred tax asset because cumulative pretax income in recent years was in an overall loss position 
the year over year increase was primarily attributable to the additional valuation allowance required in connection with the naked credit  a significant increase in the unfunded pension liability recorded in other comprehensive loss  as well as the current year s tax loss 
see note in item of this form k for a complete discussion of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
discontinued operations the company recorded a combined million after tax loss related to the divestiture of discontinued operations in the loss included million of allocated goodwill related to the discontinued properties 
in previous impairment tests  the company tested goodwill at the reporting unit level 
several of the company s reporting units consisted of both print and broadcast properties  as a result  these units were valued using a combination of print and broadcast cash flows  discount rates and market multiples 
the company also previously valued its depreciable long lived assets by applying the held for use principle  in which assets are tested for recoverability on an undiscounted basis when indicators of impairment are present  rather than the held for sale principle  which requires a comparison of current carrying value to current fair value less costs to sell 
current market prices for newspapers assets were also a significant factor in the size of the loss related to the divestiture of discontinued operations 
certain impairment losses have been included in the results of discontinued operations 
in  dealtaker failed its annual impairment test  resulting in a non cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge of million net of a tax benefit of million 
the company performed a subsequent interim impairment test on dealtaker in the first quarter of  this resulted in an additional non cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charge of million net of a tax benefit of million 
in the third quarter of  the company also performed an interim impairment test resulting in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million net of a tax benefit of million related to certain print properties in its former virginia tennessee market

million 
certain pending climate change legislation and other environmental laws and regulations could impact the company if enacted or adopted by potentially increasing its operating costs through higher electricity and other expenses associated with its facilities
