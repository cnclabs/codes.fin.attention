item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are an oncology focused company seeking to develop and commercialize next generation targeted drug candidates for cancer treatment 
we conduct our research and development programs both internally and through strategic collaborations 
erivedge is the first and only fda approved medicine for the treatment of advanced basal cell carcinoma  and was developed and is being commercialized by roche and genentech under a collaboration agreement between curis and genentech 
we are also leveraging our experience in targeting signaling pathways to develop clinical stage targeted cancer programs  including cudc  a small molecule iap inhibitor  cudc  a dual pik and hdac inhibitor and cudc  an egfr  her and hdac inhibitor 
our licensee debiopharm is progressing the clinical development of hsp inhibitor  debio erivedge erivedge vismodegib capsule 
our most advanced program is a hedgehog pathway inhibitor program under collaboration with genentech 
pursuant to this collaboration  genentech and roche are responsible for clinical development  and genentech in the us  roche outside the us  excluding japan and chugai in japan are responsible for commercialization of erivedge 
in january  the fda approved the erivedge capsule for treatment of adults with bcc that has spread to other parts of the body or that has come back after surgery or that their healthcare provider decides cannot be treated with surgery or radiation 
we refer to this indication as advanced bcc 
erivedge is also the subject of regulatory reviews for potential approval in advanced bcc by several health authorities outside of the us  including in europe and australia 
in addition  genentech is testing erivedge in clinical trials to treat less severe forms of bcc 
third party investigators are also conducting clinical trials with erivedge in bcc as well as in several other cancers 
as a result of the fda s approval of erivedge for advanced bcc  we earned a  payment from genentech  which we recognized as license revenue during the year ended december  in addition  we recorded research and development expenses related to the fda s approval of erivedge of  during this same period which represents our obligations to university licensors 
of this amount   represents the fair value of a one time issuance of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to two university licensors in connection with the fda approval of erivedge 
the remaining  represents sublicense fees we paid to these same university licensors upon our receipt of the  milestone payment 
in may  we earned a  milestone payment in connection with roche s filing of an application for marketing registration for erivedge with australia s tga  which we also recognized as license revenue during the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  roche submitted an maa for erivedge to the ema  for which we earned a  milestone payment 
in addition  we made cash payments of  which represents our obligations to university licensors 
of this amount   represents one time cash milestones specific to the australian territory and the remaining  represents ongoing sublicense fees totaling of the  in milestone payments that we received from genentech 
as a result of these payments  we recognized expenses of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents roche has indicated that it anticipates potential ema approval for erivedge during the first half of roche also filed new drug applications in for marketing registration with health agencies in other territories seeking approval for erivedge in advanced bcc 
erivedge s fda approval and roche s regulatory submissions in regards to erivedge in europe  australia  and other territories are based on positive clinical data from erivance bcc shhg  a pivotal phase ii study of erivedge in patients with advanced bcc 
we will receive additional milestone payments if erivedge receives ema or tga marketing authorization and will be obligated to make payments to university licensors that total of each of these milestone payments that we receive 
pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement with genentech  we are entitled to a royalty on net sales of erivedge that ranges from the mid to high single digits  and which escalates within this range with increasing product sales 
the royalty rate applicable to erivedge may be decreased to a low to mid single digit royalty in certain specified circumstances  including when a competing product that binds to the same molecular target as erivedge is approved by the applicable regulatory authority and is being sold in such country by a third party for use in the same indication as erivedge 
in december  through our wholly owned subsidiary curis royalty  we entered into a  debt transaction with biopharma ii 
the debt is secured with certain future royalties of erivedge 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  curis royalty borrowed  at an annual interest rate of and upon closing  we transferred to curis royalty the right to receive certain royalty and royalty related payments from the commercial sales of erivedge under curis collaboration agreement with genentech 
the loan from biopharma ii will be repaid by curis royalty from the proceeds of the royalty and royalty related payments that it receives from time to time from genentech 
quarterly royalty and royalty related payments from genentech will first be applied to pay i escrow fees payable by curis pursuant to an escrow agreement between curis  curis royalty  biopharma ii and boston private bank and trust company  ii curis royalty obligations to university licensors  as described below  iii certain expenses incurred by biopharma ii in connection with the credit agreement and related transaction documents  including enforcement of its rights in the case of an event of default under the credit agreement and iv expenses incurred by curis enforcing its right to indemnification under the collaboration agreement with genentech 
remaining amounts  subject to caps of  per quarter in   per quarter in and  per quarter in  will be applied first  to pay interest and second  principal on the loan 
curis royalty will be entitled to receive and distribute to curis remaining royalty and royalty related amounts in excess of the foregoing caps  if any 
in addition  if erivedge royalties are insufficient to pay the accrued interest on the outstanding loan  unpaid interest will be added to the principal on a quarterly basis 
as a result  we will continue to record royalty revenue from genentech but expect the majority  if not all  of such revenues  subject to the above caps  will be used to pay down the loan received from biopharma ii 
we are also obligated to make payments to university licensors on royalties that we earn in all territories other than australia in an amount that is equal to of the royalty payments that we receive from genentech for a period of years from the first commercial sale of erivedge  which occurred in february for royalties that we would earn from roche s potential future sales of erivedge in australia  we will be obligated to make payments to university licensors in an amount that is equal to of roche s direct net sales in australia until april  after which the amount will decrease to of the royalty payments that we receive from genentech for the remainder of the period ending years from the first commercial sale of erivedge  or february we recognized  of royalty revenue from genentech s net sales of erivedge during the year ended december   which was calculated as of genentech s net sales of erivedge 
we recorded cost of royalty revenues of  during this same period  including a  one time cash payment paid to a university licensor upon the first commercial sale of erivedge and  paid to two university licensors  which represents of the royalties that we earned with respect to erivedge during the year ended december  
table of contents targeted cancer drug candidates cudc iap proteins are a family of functionally and structurally related proteins that promote cancer cell survival inhibiting apoptosis 
using iap proteins and other anti apoptotic factors  cancer cells evade apoptosis in response to a variety of signals  including those provided by anti cancer agents such as chemotherapy  or naturally occurring inflammatory and immune signals transmitted through members of tumor necrosis factor  or tnf family of factors 
evasion from apoptosis is a fundamental mechanism whereby human cancers develop resistance to standard anti cancer treatments 
iap inhibitors such as cudc are designed to counteract the effects of iap proteins  thus shifting the balance away from cancer cell survival and allowing apoptosis to proceed 
in november  we licensed from genentech the exclusive  worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of a small molecule drug candidate  cudc  that is designed to promote cancer cell death by antagonizing iap proteins 
under the terms of the license agreement  we have the sole right and responsibility for all research  development  manufacturing and commercialization activities related to cudc during the fourth quarter of  we incurred in process research and development expenses of  representing the up front license payment and technology transfer costs payable to genentech 
in addition  genentech will be entitled to receive milestone payments upon the first commercial sale of cudc in certain territories and a tiered single digit royalty on net sales of cudc  if any 
prior to our license  genentech had completed enrollment in a phase i clinical trial of cudc  previously named gdc  in which patients received daily oral doses of cudc for two weeks  followed by a one week rest period until disease progression or study discontinuation for any other reason 
genentech plans to present full study results at a medical conference in mid we plan to continue the further clinical development of cudc and to initiate additional clinical studies in cudc cudc is an orally bioavailable  network targeted small molecule drug candidate designed and discovered by us to inhibit pik and hdac enzymes 
in november  we entered into an agreement under which lls will provide up to million in milestone payments to support our ongoing development of cudc in january  we treated the first patient in a phase i clinical trial in patients with advanced lymphoma and multiple myeloma and as of march   the first cohort of patients has been enrolled in this study 
as of march   we have earned  in milestone payments under the terms of the agreement with lls 
cudc cudc is a drug candidate that is designed to target egfr her and hdac 
to date  we have completed two clinical trials with an intravenous formulation of cudc  including a phase i dose escalation clinical trial of cudc in patients with advanced  refractory solid tumors and a phase i expansion trial that tested cudc in patients with specific tumor types  including breast  gastric  head and neck  nsclc or liver cancers 
an intravenous formulation of cudc is currently being tested in a phase i clinical trial in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with the current standard of care of cisplatin  a chemotherapeutic drug  and radiation 
we have enrolled ten patients in this trial as of march  in october  we initiated a phase i clinical trial of an oral formulation of cudc we subsequently terminated this study as the bioavailability observed in the first cohort of patients too low to achieve effective drug levels with this formulation 
we are currently pursuing the development of alternative formulations that may provide improved oral bioavailability  as well as backup molecules whose chemical properties may be more amenable to the oral route of administration 
debio in august  we granted a worldwide  exclusive royalty bearing license to develop  manufacture  market and sell our hsp inhibitor technology  including debio  to debiopharm 
debiopharm has assumed all future development responsibility for debio and debiopharm or a debiopharm licensee will incur all future costs related to the development  registration and commercialization of products under the agreement 

table of contents in april  debiopharm initiated a phase i clinical trial to evaluate the safety of debio in patients with advanced solid tumors 
in  debiopharm successfully advanced debio through the dose escalation portion of this phase i study and presented results of this study at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology in june in august  debiopharm initiated the hsp inhibition and lung cancer outcomes study  or halo  a phase i ii clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of debio in combination with standard of care first and second line chemotherapy agents in patients with advanced  stage iiib or iv nsclc  that is characterized as wild type egfr 
in addition  debiopharm has recently indicated that it plans to initiate another phase i study in patients with renal cell carcinoma during the second half of we are eligible for contingent payments upon treatment of the fifth patient in each of these phase ii studies if debio progresses to this stage 
liquidity since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through license fees  contingent cash payments  research and development funding from our corporate collaborators  the private and public placement of our equity securities  debt financings and the monetization of certain royalty rights 
we have never been profitable on an annual basis and have an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect that we will incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we seek to advance our research and development programs 
although genentech recently received fda approval to market erivedge in the us  the level of future sales and the amount of resulting royalty revenue payable to us are both highly uncertain 
in addition  in december we entered into a  debt financing that is secured by erivedge royalty revenues and for which up to   and  of our royalty revenues in  and are required to be applied to debt repayments 
for years after  all royalty revenues that we receive will be applied to debt repayment until the debt is fully repaid 
we currently estimate that the debt will be repaid by early  but the actual timing of repayment will be dependent on the amount of royalty revenues that we earn on sales of erivedge 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and do not expect to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  if at all 
as a result of uncertainty in the amounts of future erivedge royalty revenue and the period that will be required to repay the royalty secured debt obligation  the timing of potential milestone payments under our agreements with genentech  debiopharm and lls and the variability in our operating expenses  we expect that our financial results in the future will be variable 
we anticipate that existing capital resources as of december  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into mid our ability to continue funding our planned operations into and beyond mid is dependent on future contingent payments that we may receive from genentech  debiopharm  or lls upon the achievement of development and regulatory approval objectives  our ability to manage our expenses and our ability to raise additional funds through additional corporate collaborations  equity or debt financings  or from other sources of financing 
we believe that near term key drivers to our success will include genentech s ability to successfully scale up the commercialization of erivedge in advanced bcc in the us  genentech s and or roche s receipt of approval to commercialize erivedge in advanced bcc in europe and other territories including in australia as well as its ability to successfully launch and commercialize erivedge in these markets  positive results in genentech s ongoing phase ii clinical trial in patients with operable bcc  our ability to successfully plan  finance and complete current and planned clinical trials for cudc  cudc and cudc and advance each drug candidate into phase ii clinical testing  debiopharm s ability to advance debio into later stages of clinical development  and 
table of contents our ability to successfully enter into one or more material licenses or collaboration agreements for our proprietary drug candidates 
in the longer term  a key driver to our success will be our ability  and the ability of any current or future collaborator or licensee  to successfully commercialize drugs other than erivedge based upon our proprietary technologies 
our current collaboration and license agreements are summarized as follows genentech hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration 
under the terms of the june agreement with genentech  we granted genentech an exclusive  global  royalty bearing license  with the right to sublicense  to make  use  sell and import small molecule and antibody hedgehog pathway inhibitors 
genentech subsequently granted a sublicense to roche for non us rights to gdc  other than in japan where such rights are held by chugai 
genentech and roche have primary responsibility for worldwide clinical development  regulatory affairs  manufacturing and supply  formulation and sales and marketing 
we are not a party to this agreement between genentech and roche but we are eligible to receive cash payments for regulatory filing and approval objectives achieved and future royalties on products developed outside of the us  if any  under our june collaboration agreement with genentech 
the lead drug candidate being developed under this program is erivedge  a first in class orally administered small molecule hedgehog pathway inhibitor that is the first and only fda approved medicine for adults with advanced forms of basal cell carcinoma 
genentech and roche are responsible for worldwide clinical development  regulatory affairs  manufacturing and supply  formulation and sales and marketing of erivedge 
we are eligible to receive cash payments for regulatory filing and approval objectives achieved and future royalties on products developed outside of the us  if any  under our june collaboration agreement with genentech 
we are eligible to receive up to  in contingent cash payments for the development of erivedge or another small molecule  assuming the successful achievement by genentech and roche of specified clinical development and regulatory objectives  of which we have received  to date 
we are also eligible to receive royalties on sales of any hedgehog pathway inhibitor products that are successfully commercialized by genentech and roche  for which we recognized  in such revenue for sales of erivedge during the year ended december  future royalty payments related to erivedge will service the outstanding debt and accrued interest to biopharma ii  up to the quarterly caps for  and  and until the debt is fully repaid thereafter 
genentech iap inhibitor license agreement 
in november  we licensed from genentech the exclusive  worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of cudc  a small molecule that is designed to promote cancer cell death by antagonizing iap proteins 
under the terms of the license agreement  we have the sole right and responsibility for all research  development  manufacturing and commercialization activities related to cudc during the fourth quarter of  we incurred expenses of  representing an up front license payment and technology transfer costs payable to genentech 
in addition  genentech is entitled to receive milestone payments upon the first commercial sale of cudc in certain territories and tiered single digit royalties on net sales of cudc the leukemia lymphoma society agreement 
in november  we entered into an agreement with lls  under which lls will provide approximately of the direct costs of the development of cudc  up to  through milestone payments upon our achievement of specified development objectives with cudc  in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphomas and multiple myeloma 
in the fourth quarter of  we earned milestone payments of  under the terms of the agreement with lls related to cudc we will be obligated to make future contingent payments  including potential royalty payments under our agreement with lls upon our successful entry into a partnering agreement for cudc or upon the achievement of regulatory and commercial objectives  with such payments being limited to a maximum of times the actual milestone payments that we receive from lls under this agreement 

table of contents debiopharm hsp collaboration 
in august  we granted a worldwide  exclusive royalty bearing license to our hsp inhibitor technology to debiopharm 
the lead molecule under this license collaboration was designated debio by debiopharm 
debiopharm has assumed all future development responsibility and costs related to the development  registration and commercialization of products under the agreement 
as part of the consideration under the agreement  debiopharm paid us an up front license fee of  and we received  during in payments upon debiopharm s successful achievement of clinical and regulatory objectives  including the approval from french regulatory authorities of debiopharm s clinical trial application  or cta  to begin phase i clinical trials and the treatment of the fifth patient in this trial 
we are also eligible to receive royalties if any products under the license agreement are successfully developed and commercialized 
for net sales of debio that are made directly by debiopharm  we are entitled to a high single digit to low double digit royalty  which escalates within this range with increasing product sales 
in certain specified circumstances  the royalty rate applicable to debio may be reduced 
we believe that it is more likely that debiopharm will sublicense debio following its further development  and in this case we are entitled to a share of royalties that debiopharm receives from such sublicensee 
financial operations overview general 
our future operating results will largely depend on the magnitude of payments from our current and potential future corporate collaborators and the progress of drug candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on  among other factors  the timing of our entry into new collaborations  if any  the timing of the receipt of payments  if any  from new or existing collaborators and the cost and outcome of any preclinical development or clinical trials then being conducted 
we anticipate that existing capital resources as of december  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into mid we expect to end with cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and investments of million to million  excluding any potential payments from existing or new collaborators 
we expect that our expenses associated with the clinical development will increase as we continue to treat patients in our phase i trials for cudc and cudc in head and neck cancers and initiate additional trials for cudc and cudc  resulting in an increase in our research and development expenses for future periods as compared to prior years 
we expect that research and development expenses for the year ended december  will be million to million and that general and administrative expenses will be million to million 
these expense estimates include  and million of stock based compensation expense for research and development and general and administrative expense  respectively  which includes employee and director equity grants issued in january and february actual stock based compensation expense for fiscal may be higher as the result of our issuance of additional awards as part of our planned compensation programs  consistent with past practices 
debt 
in december  through our wholly owned subsidiary curis royalty  we entered into a  debt transaction with biopharma ii 
the debt is secured with certain future royalties of erivedge 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  curis royalty borrowed  at an annual interest rate of and upon closing  we transferred to curis royalty the right to receive certain royalty and royalty related payments from the commercial sales of erivedge under curis collaboration agreement with genentech 
the royalty and royalty related payments that curis royalty will be entitled to receive under the collaboration agreement with genentech will be the source of funds to repay principal of and interest on the loan 
the final maturity date of the loan will be the earlier of the date when principal is paid in full and the termination of curis royalty s right to receive royalties under the collaboration agreement with genentech 
the loan is secured by a security interest granted by curis royalty in its rights to receive royalty and other royalty related payments under the collaboration agreement with genentech 
the loan constitutes an obligation of curis royalty and is non recourse to curis 

table of contents under the terms of the loan  quarterly royalty and royalty related payments from genentech will first be applied to pay i escrow fees payable by curis pursuant to an escrow agreement between curis  curis royalty  biopharma ii and boston private bank and trust company  ii curis royalty obligations to academic institutions  iii certain expenses incurred by biopharma ii in connection with the credit agreement and related transaction documents  including enforcement of its rights in the case of an event of default under the credit agreement and iv expenses incurred by curis enforcing its right to indemnification under the collaboration agreement with genentech 
remaining amounts  subject to caps of  per quarter in   per quarter in and  per quarter in  will be applied first  to pay interest and second  principal on the loan 
curis royalty will be entitled to receive and distribute to curis the remaining amounts above the caps  if any 
curis royalty remains entitled to receive any royalty payments related to sales of erivedge following repayment of the loan 
since the loan requires that up to   and  in royalty revenues are applied to pay interest and principal on the loan in  and  respectively  only royalty revenue in excess of these amounts  if any  will be available to fund our operations 
no royalty revenues will be available for our use after until the loan is fully paid 
per the terms of the credit agreement  neither curis nor curis royalty guaranteed any level of future royalty or royalty related payments or the value of such payments as collateral to the loan 
however  in certain circumstances  the obligations of curis royalty under the credit agreement to repay the loan may be accelerated  including if any payment of principal is not made within three days of when such payment is due and payable or otherwise made in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement  if any representations or warranties made in the credit agreement or any other transaction document proves to be incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made  if there occurs a default in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants set forth in the credit agreement or under certain ancillary transaction documents  the failure by genentech to pay material amounts owed under the collaboration agreement with genentech because of an actual breach or default by curis under the collaboration agreement  a material breach or default by curis royalty under certain ancillary transaction documents  in each case  which breach or default is not cured within days after written demand thereof by biopharma ii  the voluntary or involuntary commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by either curis or curis royalty and other insolvency related defaults  any materially adverse effect on the binding nature of any of the transaction documents or the genentech collaboration agreement  if any person shall be designated as an independent director of curis royalty other than in accordance with its limited liability company operating agreement  or if curis shall at any time cease to own  of record and beneficially  of the equity interests in curis royalty 
if any of these conditions were to occur  curis royalty may not have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated obligation and biopharma ii could foreclose on the secured royalty and royalty related payment stream 
in such an event  we might lose our right to royalty and royalty related payments not transferred to biopharma ii  including those we would otherwise be entitled to receive if  or when  curis royalty satisfied its obligations to biopharma ii under the credit agreement 
revenue 
we do not expect to generate any revenues from our direct sale of products for several years  if ever 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been derived from license fees  research and development payments  and other amounts that we have received from our strategic collaborators and licensees  including 
table of contents royalty payments 
for the year ended december   milestone and royalty payments from genentech accounted for  or  of our total revenue  all of which related to the development and commercialization of erivedge 
since the first quarter of  we have recognized royalty revenues related to genentech s sales of erivedge in the us we expect to recognize royalty revenue in future quarters from genentech s sales of erivedge in the us and in other markets where genentech and roche successfully obtain marketing approval  if any 
future royalty payments will service the outstanding debt and accrued interest to biopharma ii  up to the quarterly caps for  and  and until the debt is fully repaid thereafter 
we currently estimate that the debt will be repaid in early we could receive additional milestone payments from genentech  debiopharm  and lls  provided the respective programs meet contractually specified development and regulatory objectives 
for example  we earned a  milestone payment from genentech in january upon fda approval of erivedge and a  milestone payment in may upon roche s submission with australian health authorities seeking to commercialize erivedge in advanced bcc in australia 
erivedge is currently being reviewed for potential marketing approval by european and australian health authorities  as well as by health authorities in several additional territories 
we are eligible to receive additional milestone revenue should erivedge receive approval by european and or australian health authorities  and we are also eligible to receive royalties on net sales of erivedge in all territories where erivedge is sold 
we currently receive no research funding for our programs under our collaborations with genentech  debiopharm  and lls and we do not expect to receive such funding in the future under these collaborations 
accordingly  our only source of revenues and or cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be up front license payments and funded research and development that we may receive under new collaboration agreements  if any  contingent cash payments for the achievement of clinical development and regulatory objectives  if any are met  under new collaborations or our existing collaborations with genentech  debiopharm  and lls and royalty payments that are contingent upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon these collaborations 
our ability to enter into new collaborations and our receipt of additional payments under our existing collaborations with genentech  debiopharm  and lls cannot be assured  nor can we predict the timing of any such arrangements or payments  as the case may be 
cost of royalty revenues 
cost of royalty revenues consists of all expenses incurred that are associated with royalty revenues that we record in the revenues section of our consolidated statements of operations 
these costs currently consist of payments we are obligated to make to university licensors on royalties that we earn from genentech on net sales of erivedge 
in all territories other than australia  our obligation is equal to of the royalty payments that we receive from genentech for a period of years from the first commercial sale of erivedge  which occurred in february for royalties that we would earn from roche s future sales of erivedge in australia  if such approval is received  we will be obligated to make payments to university licensors in an amount that is equal to of roche s direct net sales in australia until april  after which the amount will decrease to of the royalty payments that we receive from genentech for the remainder of the period ending years from the first commercial sale of erivedge  or february research and development 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover  research and develop our drug candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel including stock based compensation expense  outside service costs including  clinical research organizations and medicinal chemistry  sublicense payments  and the costs of supplies and reagents  consulting  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we are currently incurring research and development expenses under our hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration with genentech related to the maintenance of third party licenses to certain background technologies 
in addition  we record research and development expense for payments that we are obligated to make to certain third party university licensors upon our earning payments from genentech related to the achievement of clinical development and regulatory objectives under our hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration 

table of contents our development programs  both internal and under collaboration  are summarized in the following table drug candidate primary disease collaborator licensee status hedgehog pathway inhibitor erivedge advanced bcc genentech fda approved  regulatory submissions pending in eu  australia and other territories erivedge operable nodular bcc genentech phase ii antagonist of iap proteins cudc breast cancer and other solid tumors and hematological cancers internal development completed phase i dual pik and hdac inhibitor cudc advanced lymphomas and multiple myeloma internal development lls phase i egfr her and hdac inhibitor cudc intravenous formulation locally advanced scchn internal development phase i hsp inhibitor debio advanced nsclc debiopharm phase i ii debio solid tumor cancers debiopharm phase ib because of the early stages of development of these programs  our ability and that of our collaborators and licensees to successfully complete preclinical studies and clinical trials of these drug candidates  and the timing of completion of such programs  is highly uncertain 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs which may affect our and our collaborators future results  including the scope  quality of data  rate of progress and cost of clinical trials and other research and development activities undertaken by us or our collaborators  the results of future preclinical studies and clinical trials  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our drug candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost and effectiveness of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any of our drug candidates 
any failure to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a further discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our research and development programs on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so  are set forth under part i  item a risk factors 
in process research and development 
we recognized in process research and development expenses of  during the year ended december  for to the one time license and technology transfer fees related to the licensing of cudc from genentech 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries  stock based compensation expense and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal  patent and accounting services 
patent costs include certain patents covered under collaborations  a portion of which is reimbursed by collaborators and a portion of which is borne by us 
we expect that our general and administration expenses may increase in future periods as compared to prior periods as patent costs related to our proprietary programs and hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration with genentech could increase  as well as an increase in employee related costs associated with additions to our senior management team 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of certain assets and liabilities at our balance sheet date 
such estimates and judgments include the carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets  revenue recognition  the value of certain liabilities  including our warrant liability  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into strategic license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our drug candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
we follow the provisions of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  codification topic  revenue recognition 
license fees and multiple element arrangements 
in january  we adopted a new us gaap accounting standard which amends existing revenue recognition accounting guidance to provide accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this new guidance eliminates the requirement to establish objective evidence of fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
the new standard was implemented on a prospective basis for new or materially modified arrangements beginning in for multiple element arrangements  including license agreements  entered into prior to january   guidance required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
under this guidance  if the fair value of all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 

table of contents non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research and or steering committee services  can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have stand alone value or ii have stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a relative performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the relative performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 
revenue recognized under the relative performance method would be determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the relative performance method  as of each reporting period 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  the performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis and we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential  then the total payments under the arrangement  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  would be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line basis  as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential and perfunctory  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential and perfunctory 
revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance 
in addition  if we are involved in a steering committee as part of a multiple element arrangement that is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we assess whether our involvement constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 

table of contents substantive milestone payments 
our collaboration agreements may also contain substantive milestone payments 
collaboration agreements that contain substantive milestone payments are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if such milestone is commensurate with either of the following a the vendor s performance to achieve the milestone for example  the achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  or b the enhancement of the value of the deliverable as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the vendor s performance to achieve the milestone or substantive effort on our part is involved in achieving the milestone  such milestone relates solely to past performance  and the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
determination as to whether a payment meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone  and the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
in addition  the determination that one such payment was not a substantive milestone could prevent us from concluding that subsequent milestone payments were substantive milestones and  as a result  any additional milestone payments could also be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and would be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable 
milestones that are tied to regulatory approval are not considered probable of being achieved until such approval is received 
milestones tied to counter party performance are not included in our revenue model until the performance conditions are met 
reimbursement of costs 
reimbursement of research and development costs by third party collaborators are recognized as revenue provided the provisions of the fasb codification topic  revenue recognition  principal agent consideration  are met  the amounts are determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue 
since the first quarter of  we have recognized royalty revenues related to genentech s sales of erivedge in the us we expect to recognize royalty revenue in future quarters from genentech s sales of erivedge in the us and in other markets where genentech and roche successfully obtain marketing approval  if any 
however  erivedge royalties we earn will service our debt to biopharma ii  and only amounts in excess of certain quarterly repayment caps  if any  will be available to us for use in operations 
royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of the related products  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  we expect to attribute the royalty payments to the services being provided under the arrangement and therefore recognize such royalty payments as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
deferred revenue 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
significant judgments are required in the application of revenue recognition guidance 
for example  in connection with our existing and former collaboration agreements  we have historically recorded on our balance sheet short and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue would be recognized 
short term deferred revenue would consist of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue  or applied against future co development costs  within the next fiscal year 
amounts that we expect will not be recognized in the next fiscal 
table of contents year would be classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate would be based on our operating plan as of the balance sheet date and on our estimated performance periods under the collaboration in which we have recorded deferred revenues 
if our operating plan or our estimated performance period would change  we could recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the reporting period 
with respect to each of the foregoing areas of revenue recognition  we exercise significant judgment in determining whether an arrangement contains multiple elements  and  if so  how much revenue is allocable to each element 
in addition  we exercise our judgment in determining when our significant obligations have been met under such agreements and the specific time periods over which we recognized revenue  such as non refundable  up front license fees 
to the extent that actual facts and circumstances differ from our initial judgments  our revenue recognition with respect to such transactions would change accordingly and any such change could affect our reported financial results 
stock based compensation we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  which generally requires that stock based compensation transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and is now referred to as fasb codification topic  compensation stock compensation 
we have recorded employee and director stock based compensation expense of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we estimate that we will record approximately  in stock based compensation expense in we have granted and expect that we may grant additional options in that could increase the amount of stock based compensation ultimately recognized 
the amount of the incremental employee stock based compensation expense attributable to employee stock options to be granted will depend primarily on the number of stock options granted  the fair market value of our common stock at the respective grant dates  and the specific terms of the stock options 
we measure compensation cost for share based compensation at fair value  including estimated forfeitures  and recognize the expense as compensation expense over the period that the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which generally is the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options 
this model requires significant estimates related to the award s expected life and future stock price volatility of the underlying equity security 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  we also are required to estimate forfeiture rates for awards  based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
fair value measurements we have adopted the provisions of the fasb codification topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
topic provides a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
gaap defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are i independent  ii knowledgeable  iii able to transact  and iv willing to transact 
gaap requires the use of valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach  the income approach and or the cost approach 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts  such as cash flows or earnings  to a single present amount on a discounted basis 
the cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity 
table of contents of an asset replacement cost 
valuation techniques should be consistently applied 
gaap also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs  where available  and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
our cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments have been classified as either level or level assets 
we do not hold any asset backed or auction rate securities 
short term accounts receivable and accounts payable are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at net realizable value  which approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments 
in  we completed a registered direct offering in which we issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock  and the warrants were deemed to be a liability 
we estimate the fair value of the warrants using a black scholes option pricing model under various probability weighted outcomes which take into consideration the protective  but limited  cash settlement feature of the warrants 
in using this model  the fair value is determined by applying level inputs  which have included assumptions around the estimated future stock price of our common stock and varying probabilities that certain events will occur 
significant increases or decreases in any of these assumptions would materially impact the fair value of the warrants and our financial statements 
the warrants will be revalued each reporting period with updated assumptions  and the resulting change in fair value of the warrant liability will be recognized in our financial statements 
while we believe our valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment  debt issuance costs and goodwill 
property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight line method 
determining the economic lives of property and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
if it were determined that the carrying value of our other long lived assets might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure an impairment based on application of the fasb codification topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
debt issuance costs are stated at cost and amortized over the estimated term of the debt using the straight line method 
assumptions used in determining the term of the debt requires us to make significant judgments that would impact our operating results  however  we do not believe adjustments to the term of the debt and related amortization period would have a material impact on our financial statements 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an indicator of potential impairment exists 
in performing our evaluations of impairment  we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows 
these calculations contain uncertainties as they require us to make assumptions related to future cash flows  projected useful lives of assets and the appropriate discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we must also make assumptions regarding industry 
table of contents economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to a material impairment charge 
as a single reporting unit  we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests in december  and  and determined that as of those dates our fair value exceeded the carrying value of our net assets 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment was recognized in  and our discussion of our critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive discussion of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

our license fee revenues of  for the year ended december  are related to payments we received from genentech upon fda approval of erivedge and roche s filing for marketing registration in australia 
during the year ended december   we recognized  in license revenue upon fda and ema acceptances of genentech s nda and maa filings for erivedge 
all potential future contingent payments under our agreements with genentech and debiopharm are tied to clinical and regulatory milestones  which are unpredictable in terms of both timing and whether such milestone will be achieved at all 
we are entitled to receive additional payments if erivedge receives ema and or australian marketing approvals 
if debiopharm progresses debio into phase ii clinical testing  we will be entitled to payments upon treatment of the fifth patient in up to three such trials 

table of contents research and development revenues  excluding those earned under our lls agreement  are limited to expenses that we incur under our collaborations  primarily genentech  for which our collaborators are obligated to reimburse us 
cost of royalty revenues 
cost of royalty revenues of  for the year ended december  includes a  one time cash payment paid to a university licensor upon the first commercial sale of erivedge and  paid to two university licensors  which represents of the royalties that we earned with respect to erivedge

during the years ended december  and  we incurred sublicense fees of  and  respectively  to various university licensors as a result of the receipt of contingent payments from genentech for the achievement of regulatory objectives related to erivedge 
the  increase for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a one time issuance of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to two university licensors in connection with the fda approval of erivedge with a fair value of  as well as an increase in fees owed to university licensors in connection with our obtaining payments from roche under our collaboration agreement  including a  expense specific to development objectives achieved pursuant to roche s nda filing in australia 
spending on our cudc program increased  for the year ended december  over the prior year primarily related to costs for additional ind enabling toxicology studies that were completed during  formulation development and clinical trial costs 
spending related to our cudc programs increased  over the prior year as a result of an increase in employee related expenses as more resources were allocated to the various cudc development programs  including the ongoing phase i clinical trial in head and neck cancer patients and the phase i clinical trial with an oral formulation of cudc that was halted in november these increases were offset by decreased spending on our cudc phase ib trial  as the last patient on trial was treated in october further offsetting these increases  spending on our other preclinical network targeted cancer programs decreased  when compared to the prior year as our internal resources were primarily allocated to cudc and cudc 
table of contents stock based compensation also increased  during the year ended december  from the prior year  primarily related to an increase in the number of and the expense recognized on unvested non employee stock options that are marked to market at each quarterly reporting period 
fluctuations in our stock price over the period will result in comparable fluctuations in the related expense 
we expect that a majority of our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future will be incurred in support of our efforts to advance cudc  cudc and cudc in addition  we will be obligated to pay sublicense fees for i any milestone payments we may receive upon achievement of specified regulatory objectives and ii royalty payments on net sales of erivedge in the us we will also be obligated to pay genentech milestone payments upon the first commercial sale of cudc in certain territories and royalties on net sales of cudc  if any  and we could be obligated to pay lls up to a maximum of  if cudc is partnered or commercialized on or after completion of a phase iia trial

this increase was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation of  as a result of an increase in the number of and grant date fair value of options granted to our directors and officers during as compared to in addition  legal fees increased  from the prior year due to increased costs associated with various corporate matters as well as patent related costs  including foreign patent filing costs 
consulting and professional service costs increased  over the prior year primarily related to business development efforts 
finally  personnel costs increased  due to an increase in executive officers compensation when compared to the prior year 
change in fair value of warrant liability 
in connection with our january registered direct offering  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock which became exercisable as of the closing of the transaction 
the warrants have an initial exercise price of per share and have a five year term  and the fair value of the warrants is recorded as a long term liability 
the fair value of the warrants has been estimated using a black scholes option pricing model under various probability weighted outcomes which took into consideration the protective  but limited  cash settlement feature for the benefit of the warrant holder that expired on january  the warrants are revalued each reporting period  with updated assumptions and the resulting gains and losses recorded as the change in fair value of warrant liability in the statement of operations 
expected volatilities used in the models were based on our historical volatility commensurate with the term of the warrants 
we estimated that the fair value of the warrants at december  was  using this model with the following assumptions expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of  expected life of years 
table of contents and no dividends 
we estimated that the fair value of the warrants at december  was  using this same model with the following assumptions assigned to the varying outcomes expected volatility of  a risk free interest rate of  expected life of three years and no dividends 
we recorded other income of  and a charge of  for the years ended december  and  respectively  due to the change in the fair value of the warrant liability which was primarily related to the change in our stock price during the respective periods

research and development revenues increased by  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the increase was largely due to an increase in expenses that we incurred under our collaborations  primarily our collaboration with genentech  for which such collaborators were obligated to reimburse us

table of contents general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was related to a reduction in spending in several areas  primarily for legal services 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately  in expenses related to an arbitration proceeding that we filed against our former collaborator that we did not incur during the year ended december  in addition  legal costs associated with various matters decreased  from the prior year period

cash flows the use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our office and laboratory  fees paid in connection with preclinical and clinical studies  laboratory supplies  consulting fees and legal fees 
we expect that costs associated with clinical studies will increase in future periods assuming that cudc  cudc and cudc advance into further stages of clinical testing 
operating activities used cash of  for the year ended december   which was primarily the result of our net loss for the period of  offset by non cash charges totaling  consisting of stock based compensation  changes in the fair value of our warrant liability  non cash interest expense  the issuance of common stock to licensees and depreciation 
we received  in milestone and royalty payments from genentech as well as  in milestone payments from lls during the period

changes in certain operating assets and liabilities had offsetting impacts on operating cash during the year ended december  finally  an increase of  in our accounts receivable  primarily related to quarterly royalties earned on the sale of erivedge  decreased operating cash 
cash used in operating activities of  during the year ended december  was primarily the result of our net loss for the period of  partially offset by non cash charges totaling  consisting of stock based compensation  changes in the fair value of our warrant liability  non cash interest expense  depreciation and a gain on the sale of assets 
we received  in payments from genentech during the year ended december  offsetting these cash receipts  we incurred operating and other expenses of  for the year ended december  in addition  changes in certain operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash during the year ended december   primarily related to an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  we expect to continue to use cash in operations as we seek to advance our targeted cancer drug candidates 
in addition  in the future we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensors based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and other specified objectives 
investing activities used cash of  for year ended december  and provided cash of  for the year ended december   resulting primarily from net investment activity for the 
table of contents respective periods 
the increase in investments during the year ended december  was the result of an increase in cash receipts from the prior year  while the decrease during the year ended december   was a result of the need for cash in order to fund our operations 
in addition  during the years ended december  and  we reduced our restricted investments  resulting in an increase in our available cash for the periods of  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   the restriction on our short term investment ended and we reduced our long term restricted investment resulting in an increase in our available cash for the period 
these increases in cash were offset by purchases of research equipment totaling  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
financing activities provided cash of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase during the year ended december   was primarily related to the debt financing transaction secured by erivedge royalties  that provided proceeds of  marginally offset by related issuance costs of  under the terms of the loan  interest will accrue at per annum and quarterly payments  subject to certain caps  will be applied to pay interest and principal on the loan after deducting royalty obligations for university licensors and certain other specified payments 
the final maturity date of the loan will be the earlier of the date when the principal is paid in full and the termination of curis royalty s right to receive royalties under the collaboration agreement with genentech 
the exercise of stock options and warrants and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan provided cash of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we issued  shares of our common stock related to these exercises and purchases during the year ended december  compared to  shares for the year ended december  we also received  and  in net proceeds from sales of common stock under our at market issuance sales agreement  or atm agreement  with mcnicoll  lewis vlak  llc  or mlv  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
funding requirements we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we will require substantial funds to continue our research and development programs and to fulfill our planned operating goals 
in particular  our currently planned operating and capital requirements include the need for working capital to support our research and development activities for cudc  cudc and cudc  and to fund our general and administrative costs and expenses 
we have historically derived a substantial portion of our operating cash flow from the research funding portion of collaboration agreements with third parties 
however  we have no current research funding revenue under these agreements 
our ability to generate cash flow to operate our business will depend  in part  on royalty payments from the commercial sale of erivedge and the ability of erivedge to be approved for commercial sale in other countries  which would result in us becoming eligible to receive additional milestone payments as well as royalties on any future sales subject to our obligation to transfer certain royalties to biopharma ii pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement 
we expect that our only source of cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be up front license payments and research and development funding that we may receive if we are able to successfully enter into new collaboration agreements  contingent cash payments that we may receive for the achievement of development objectives under any new collaborations or our existing collaborations with genentech  debiopharm and lls  and royalty payments that are contingent upon the successful commercialization of products based upon these collaborations  including royalties on sales of erivedge in advanced bcc by genentech  subject to our obligation to transfer certain royalties to biopharma ii pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement 

table of contents we may not be able to successfully enter into or continue any corporate collaborations and the timing  amount and likelihood of us receiving payments under such collaborations is highly uncertain 
for example  the amount of future royalty payments that we will receive as a result of genentech s us net sales of erivedge  as well as potential future royalty payments that we may receive on net sales of erivedge in territories outside of the us  to the extent that genentech successfully obtains marketing approval in such territories  is highly uncertain 
in addition  we will only receive royalties over certain quarterly caps through  if any  as the erivedge royalties will service the outstanding debt to biopharma ii until the loan is paid in full 
we anticipate that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  investments and working capital at december   should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into mid our future capital requirements  however  may vary from what we currently expect 
there are a number of factors that may adversely affect our planned future capital requirements and accelerate our need for additional financing  many of which are outside our control  including the following unanticipated costs in our research and development programs  the timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  the timing  receipt and amount of payments  if any  from current and potential future collaborators  the timing and amount of payments due to licensors of patent rights and technology used in our drug candidates  including the level of any royalty payments from sales of erivedge  which could increase the outstanding debt due to biopharma ii if the royalty payments are insufficient to cover the accrued interest when payments are due  unplanned costs to prepare  file  prosecute  maintain and enforce patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and technology license fees  and unexpected losses in our cash investments or an inability to otherwise liquidate our cash investments due to unfavorable conditions in the capital markets 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings of debt or equity 
the market for emerging life science stocks in general  and the market for our common stock in particular  are highly volatile 
due to this and various other factors  including potentially adverse general market conditions and the early stage status of our internal development pipeline and the early stage of the commercial us launch of erivedge  additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  the terms of any potential financing may be dilutive or otherwise adversely affect other rights of our stockholders 
we also expect to seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators  licensees or other third parties 
these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates  and we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all 
we anticipate that we will require additional funding 
if we are unable to obtain such additional funding on a timely basis  whether through payments under existing or future collaborations or license agreement or sales of debt or equity  we may be required to delay  limit  reduce or terminate preclinical studies  clinical trials or other development activities for one or more of our drug candidates  or delay  limit  reduce or prevent us from establishing sales and marketing capabilities  either internally or through third parties  or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our drug candidates

effective september   we entered into a new lease agreement with the trustees of lexington office realty trust pursuant to which we lease  square feet of property for office  research and laboratory space located at maguire road in lexington  massachusetts 
the term of the lease agreement commenced on december   and expires in february the total remaining cash obligation for the base rent over the initial term of the lease agreement is approximately  in addition to the base rent  we are responsible for our share of operating expenses and real estate taxes  in accordance with the terms of the lease agreement

table of contents future clinical trials  would be  these future obligations are not reflected in the table above as these payments are contingent upon achievement of developmental and commercial milestones  the likelihood of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our revenue and results of operations since inception 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued amended accounting guidance for testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the amendments permit a company to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  a company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value  then the company is not required to take further action 
a company also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
a company will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we did not elect to early adopt and we do not expect the adoption to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued amended accounting guidance for reporting accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendments require a company to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  a company is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  a company is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  other than a change in presentation  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our current cash balances in excess of operating requirements are invested in cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  which consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  short term commercial paper  and government obligations with an average maturity of less than one year  and long term investments 
all marketable securities and long term investments are considered available for sale 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
this objective may be adversely affected by the ongoing economic downturn and volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions 
our marketable securities and long term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
while as of the date of this filing  we are not aware of any downgrades  material losses  or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents  marketable securities or long term investments since december   no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or marketable securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives 
further dislocations in the credit market may adversely impact the value and or liquidity of marketable securities and long term investments owned by us 
to help manage this risk  we limit our investments to investment grade securities and deposits are with investment grade financial institutions 
we believe that the realization of losses due to changes in credit spreads is unlikely as we currently have the ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to recover the fair value of the investment and there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the fair value of the investment is recoverable 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a change in interest rate percentages would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our interest income
