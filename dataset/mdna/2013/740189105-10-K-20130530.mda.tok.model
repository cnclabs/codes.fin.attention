item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions  except per share data business overview the company completed twelve acquisitions in fiscal following eight acquisitions completed in fiscal we have focused on and have been diligent in acquiring the right assets over the last few years  and now these acquisitions have started to deliver on the value we anticipated 
our traditional end markets in aerospace and industrial gas turbine igt have done well  and our entry into newer businesses over the last two years such as aerostructures  oil and gas and most recently the acquisition of titanium manufacturing is adding additional upside opportunities 
base commercial aircraft and boeing production rates continue to increase  driving steady demand for airframe and engine components 
our power businesses are improving on several fronts 
due to the price and availability of natural gas  igt spares sales have been strong 
in addition  we experienced an increase in oil and gas sales resulting from accelerating shipments of downhole casings 
we also generated more than billion of cash from operations during fiscal  and revenue reached a record level  exceeding billion  following a record year in fiscal airframe products segment acquisitions we continue to focus on expanding our product lines and markets 
we have a strong focus on development of our aerostructures platform 
with the integration of primus in fiscal  we are capturing valuable synergies to achieve top and bottom line growth

our largest acquisition during fiscal was titanium metals corporation timet  which closed late in the third quarter 
timet provides us with a titanium capability that has been a key missing piece of our overall portfolio 
timet melting expertise and our forging and conversion assets will be a significant catalyst in achieving our long term objectives  improving our cost structure and further enhancing our customer presence and penetration of new markets 
we also made several small tuck in acquisitions in fiscal and fiscal that expanded our manufacturing capabilities 
we expect our baseline capital expenditures for fiscal to be modestly higher than fiscal based on our current forecasts 
these expenditures will be targeted for equipment upgrades  capacity expansion  cost reduction and productivity projects across all segments  as well as completing projects at timet and other acquisitions that were started prior to pcc ownership 
over the past year  even with the addition of the acquisitions mentioned above  the vast majority with margins lower than our company average  our overall operating performance increased 
over the long term  as a company  we are focused daily on delivering strong incremental margins as our sales increase 
we continue driving results and identifying opportunities to build both top and bottom line growth

s statutory tax rate and benefits from non recurring adjustments to prior year tax assets and liabilities  partially offset by reduced benefits from the research and development credit 
liquidity and capital resources total assets of  million at march  represented a  million increase from the  million balance at april  the increase in total assets principally reflects proceeds from the billion debt offering  which were used to fund the acquisition of timet  and million of commercial paper borrowings  which were used to fund other fiscal acquisitions 
cash generated from operations during fiscal was  million 
tangible and intangible assets recorded in the twelve acquisitions during fiscal also contributed to the increase  since assets acquired exceeded assets used in the acquisition due to the liabilities assumed 
total capitalization at march  was  million  consisting of  million of debt and  million of equity 
the debt to capitalization ratio increased to at march  from at the end of fiscal  reflecting higher borrowings to fund fiscal acquisitions 
on december   we entered into an underwriting agreement with several underwriters for the issuance and sale by the company of billion aggregate principal amount of notes as follows million of senior notes due  billion of senior notes due  billion of senior notes due  and million of senior notes due cash as of march  was million  a decrease of million from the end of fiscal  and total debt was  million  up  million since the end of fiscal the net negative cash flow reflects cash paid to acquire businesses net of cash acquired of  million  capital expenditures of million and million of stock repurchases  partially offset by cash generated from operations of  million and million from the issuance of common stock 
capital spending of million in fiscal principally provided for cost reduction and productivity projects and equipment upgrades throughout the company 
we expect our baseline capital expenditures for fiscal to be modestly higher than fiscal based on our current forecasts 
these expenditures will be targeted for equipment upgrades  capacity expansion  and cost reduction and productivity projects across all segments 
during fiscal  we contributed million to the defined benefit pension plans  of which million was voluntary 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we will make a million voluntary contribution to various defined benefit pension plans 
we expect to contribute approximately million of required contributions in fiscal  for total contributions to the defined benefit pension plans of approximately million in fiscal in addition  we contributed million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal we expect to contribute approximately million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal in december  we acquired million of debt as a result of the acquisition of timet 
this debt was repaid during the third quarter of fiscal historically  we have issued commercial paper as a method of raising short term liquidity 
we believe we will continue to have the ability to issue commercial paper and have issued commercial paper to cover acquisitions and short term cash requirements in recent quarters 
as of march   the amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding was million and the weighted average interest rate was 
there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of april  during fiscal  the average amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding was million and the weighted average interest rate was 
during fiscal  the average amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding was million and the weighted average interest rate was 
during fiscal and  the largest daily balance of outstanding commercial paper borrowings was million and million  respectively 
we do not anticipate any changes in our ability to borrow under our current credit facility  but changes in the financial condition of the participating financial institutions could negatively impact our ability to borrow funds in the future 
should that circumstance arise  we believe that we would be able to arrange any needed financing  although we are not able to predict what the terms of any such borrowings would be or the source of the borrowed funds 
our long term revolving bank credit facility the original credit agreement is a five year  billion revolving credit facility with a million increase option  subject to approval of the lenders maturing november   unless extended pursuant to two day extension options subject to approval of the lenders 
the original credit agreement is unsecured and contains customary representations and warranties  events of default  and financial and other covenants 
on december   we entered into a day billion revolving credit facility maturing december  the new credit agreement  unless converted into a one year term loan at the option of the company at the end of the revolving period 
the new credit agreement is unsecured and contains customary representations and warranties  events of default  and financial and other covenants 
we have not borrowed funds under the new credit agreement as of march  the new credit agreement is in addition to the existing billion original credit agreement 
the original and new credit agreements may be referred to collectively as the credit agreements 
our unused borrowing capacity as of march  was billion 
our financial covenant requirement and actual ratio as of march  was as follows covenant requirement actual consolidated leverage ratio maximum terms are defined in the credit agreements 
as of march   we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit agreements 
we believe we will be able to meet our short and longer term liquidity needs for working capital  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  capital spending  cash dividends  scheduled repayment of debt and potential acquisitions with the cash generated from operations  borrowing from our credit agreements or new bank credit facilities  the issuance of public or privately placed debt securities  or the issuance of equity instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements there are currently no off balance sheet arrangements that are  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements 
the following table represents our contractual payment obligations as of march  and the estimated timing of future cash payments contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases cash contributions to qualified pension plans interest on fixed rate debt interest on variable rate debt total operating lease obligations include million attributable to operations held for sale 
interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions at march  was million 
due to the uncertainties associated with settling these liabilities  we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement 
as a result  our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is excluded from the table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
we also have benefit payments due under our non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance  but are pay as you go 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
note that the preparation of this annual report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectability is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing maintenance and engineering activities  are recognized as services are performed 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue 
valuation of inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or market value  with the market value being determined based on sales in the ordinary course of business 
cost for inventories at a significant number of our operations is determined on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age  historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory 
we also regularly review inventory balances on a lifo basis to ensure the balances are stated at the lower of cost or market as of the balance sheet date 
for those inventories valued using lifo  their carrying value may be higher or lower than current replacement costs for such inventory  since the lifo costing assumption matches current costs with current sales  not with current inventory values 
when the lifo cost is greater than the current cost  there is an increased likelihood that our inventories could be subject to write downs to market value 
while historical write downs have not been material  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
acquisition accounting we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting 
this requires that we make various assumptions and estimates regarding the fair value of assets  liabilities and contractual as well as non contractual contingencies at the date of acquisition 
these assumptions can have a material impact on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future 
goodwill and acquired intangibles we regularly acquire businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets related to our continuing operations are tested for impairment at a minimum each fiscal year at the end of the second month in the second quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets exceeds their fair value 
for fiscal  our reporting units consisted of two operating segments within our investment cast products reportable operating segment  three operating segments within our forged products reportable operating segment  as well as four reporting units in our airframe products reportable operating segment 
timet  which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  will be tested for goodwill impairment in fiscal testing for goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations 
such models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily based on future cash flows  expected market growth rates  our estimates of sales volumes  sales prices and related costs  and the discount rate applied  which reflects the weighted average cost of capital 
management uses the best available information at the time fair values of the reporting units are estimated  however  estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements potentially resulting from an impairment of the goodwill 
we also consider comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the cash flow models used to determine fair value are most sensitive to the expected future cash flows and the discount rate for each reporting unit 
the discount rate used in the cash flow models for the fiscal goodwill impairment analysis ranged from to depending on the reporting unit 
the annual growth rate for earnings before interest and taxes varied by reporting unit and ranged from to over the initial five year forecast period 
a sensitivity analysis determined that using terminal growth rates of  or would not result in impairment in the fiscal goodwill impairment analysis 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on both of these factors and determined that the forecast for future earnings before interest and taxes used in the cash flow model could decrease by or the discount rate utilized could increase by  and the goodwill of our reporting units would not be impaired 
the reporting unit that would be most sensitive to worsening economic conditions has million of goodwill recorded as of march  the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  impairment is recorded 
for fiscal and  it was determined that the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was greater than the carrying value 
environmental costs the estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred  and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of amounts is established  and no amount within the range is better than another  the minimum amount of the range is recorded 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable 
adjustments to our accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but any amounts  and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued  are not reasonably estimable at this time 
total environmental liabilities accrued at march  and april  were million and million  respectively 
the increase in environmental liabilities during fiscal was primarily due to the reserves related to the timet acquisition 
in fiscal the environmental liability was increased by million from acquisitions  the majority of which was related to the acquisition of timet 
due to the nature of its historical operations  timet has significant environmental liabilities at its titanium manufacturing plants 
it has for many years  under the oversight of government agencies  conducted investigations of the soil and groundwater contamination at its plant sites 
timet has initiated remedial actions at its properties  including the capping of former on site landfills  removal of contaminated sediments from on site surface impoundments  remediation of contaminated soils and the construction of a slurry wall and groundwater extraction system to treat contaminated groundwater 
although it is anticipated that significant remediation will be completed within the next two to three years  it is expected that a substantial portion of the timet environmental accruals will be expended over many years 
expenditures related to these remedial actions and for resolving timet other environmental liabilities will be applied against existing liabilities 
as the remedial actions are implemented at these sites  the liabilities will be adjusted based on the progress made in determining the extent of contamination and the extent of required remediation 
while the existing liability generally represents our current best estimate of the costs of resolving the identified environmental liabilities  these costs may change substantially due to factors such as  among others  the nature and extent of contamination  changes in legal and remedial requirements and changes in cleanup technologies 
in the case of our recent acquisitions  and specifically the timet acquisition  we continue to investigate the extent of contamination that existed on the acquisition date  and we expect to revise the provisional amount we recorded as of the acquisition date as additional information about the costs to remediate the existing matters is gathered and evaluated 
guidance on asset retirement and environmental obligations clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
asset retirement obligations covered by this guidance include those for which an entity has a significant obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however  the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity 
this guidance also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
in accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations guidance  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
currently  we have identified known asset retirement obligations associated with environmental contamination at several of our manufacturing facilities and have accrued approximately million to satisfy these asset retirement obligations 
however  we have not recognized a liability under guidance for asset retirement obligations at two of our manufacturing facilities because the fair value retirement obligation at these sites cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time 
the settlement date is unknown because the retirement obligation remediation of contamination of these sites is not required until production ceases  and we have no current or future plans to cease production 
these asset retirement obligations  when estimable  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or business 
income taxes provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include  in the current period  the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable  because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities 
the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans we sponsor many us and us defined benefit pension plans 
our pension and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans accounting guidance 
plan assets have been valued at fair value in accordance with this guidance 
pension and postretirement expense and liability amounts are derived from several significant assumptions  including the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate 
for valuation of our pension liabilities  we derive a market based discount rate from yields on high quality  liquid fixed income securities at the end of our fiscal year 
we use only highly rated bonds aa aa or higher to estimate the interest rate at which our pension benefits could be effectively settled 
for our us plans  we used a discount rate assumption of for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our march  measurement date 
for our non us plans  we used a discount rate assumption of for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our march  measurement date 
in developing the long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions  we evaluate input from third party investment consultants and actuaries review asset allocation and investment strategies  ranges of projected and historical returns  and inflation and economic assumptions 
the expected return assumptions are derived from asset allocations within the company target asset allocation ranges consistent with our diversified investment approach 
as the assumed rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption  it is not anticipated to be as volatile as the discount rate  which is a point in time measurement 
for our us plans  we used a long term rate of return assumption of to calculate the and net periodic pension cost 
for our non us plans  we used a long term rate of return assumption of to calculate the and net periodic pension cost 
for fiscal  our us net periodic pension expense was million and non us net periodic pension income was million 
we estimate that for fiscal  our us net periodic pension expense will be approximately million and non us net periodic pension income will be approximately million 
our us net postretirement benefit cost was million for fiscal  and we estimate that for fiscal  our us net postretirement benefit cost will be million 
the table below quantifies the approximate impact  as of march   of a one quarter percentage point decrease in our assumptions for discount rate and expected return on assets  holding other assumptions constant 
percentage point decrease increase in annual costs discount rate expected long term rate of return increase in projected benefit obligation discount rate the approximate impact  as of march   of a one percentage point increase in our assumption for the health care cost trend rate  holding other assumptions constant  on our total service and interest cost components and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is not significant 
recently issued accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amendments to address the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment when a parent entity sells or transfers either a subsidiary or a group of assets within a foreign entity 
the guidance is effective for the company beginning the first quarter of fiscal and will be applied prospectively 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued guidance that adds new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  including changes in aoci balances by component and significant items reclassified out of aoci 
the guidance does not amend any existing requirements for reporting net income or oci in the financial statements 
the guidance is effective for the company beginning the first quarter of fiscal and will be applied prospectively 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued guidance that amends the guidance on testing indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment 
under the new guidance  an entity testing an indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment has the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the asset 
if the entity determines  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is not more likely than not impaired  the entity would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset 
the guidance is effective for the company for our annual impairment test for fiscal the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued guidance increasing disclosures regarding offsetting of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet 
for derivatives and financial assets and liabilities  the amendments require disclosure of gross asset and liability amounts  amounts offset on the balance sheet  and amounts subject to the offsetting requirements but not offset on the balance sheet 
the guidance is effective for the company beginning the first quarter of fiscal and will be applied retrospectively 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued guidance to aid in an entity assessment of goodwill and whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under this guidance  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
this pronouncement was effective in the first quarter of fiscal as this guidance only modified the requirements of impairment testing  the adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued guidance that requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
the guidance does not change the items that must be reported in oci 
the guidance was effective for the company beginning the first quarter of fiscal and has been applied retrospectively 
the guidance required a change in the company financial statement presentation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at various times  we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials 
because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes  fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge
