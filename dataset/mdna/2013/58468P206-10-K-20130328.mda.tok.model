table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under the caption item a 
risk factors 
overview background we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and developing novel  small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases with unmet medical needs with a commercial focus on the us market 
we were incorporated in delaware in september we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million 
at december   from inception  our accumulated deficit was million  including million of non cash stock based compensation charges 
we expect to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we continue to develop certain of our existing product development programs  and over the long term if we expand our research and development programs and acquire or in license products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own 
as of december   we had available cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
we expect to have approximately million in available cash as of march   and  assuming we raise additional capital  we expect to spend approximately million from april  through december  to execute our strategic plan and fund operations 
as of the date of this report  we have working capital sufficient to fund operations through june  these factors raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
between august  and the date of this report we have generated proceeds of million under the common stock purchase agreement with aspire capital fund llc aspire including proceeds of million on the sale  shares of our common stock subsequent to december  we have the right  subject to the terms of the common stock purchase agreement  to cause aspire to acquire up to  shares for total gross proceeds not to exceed million including the  shares issued or sold to aspire to date for million  subject to daily dollar limitations and subject to the maximum dollar amount we can sell from time to time under our registration statement on form s we expect to sell additional shares under this agreement during we are also pursuing other opportunities to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or through other strategic initiatives 
there can be no assurances that there will be adequate financing available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if the company is unable to obtain additional financing  we may have to sell one or more of our programs or cease operations 
we are currently focusing our development activities on mn  an ibudilast based drug candidate for the treatment of neurological disorders  and obtaining additional funding to advance clinical trial development of mn  a novel  highly selective 

adrenergic receptor agonist being developed for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and copd 
including mn and mn and our other product development programs  we have acquired licenses to eight compounds for the development of ten product candidates which include clinical development for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma  ms and other central nervous system cns disorders  bronchial asthma  interstitial cystitis ic  solid tumor cancers  generalized anxiety disorders insomnia  preterm labor and urinary incontinence 
we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture company with zhejiang medicine co  ltd 
and beijing make friend medicine technology co  ltd 
effective september  the joint venture agreement 
table of contents provides for the joint venture company  zhejiang sunmy bio medical co  ltd 
zhejiang sunmy  to develop and commercialize mn in china 
a sublicense will be required under which zhejiang sunmy will license mn from us 
in accordance with the joint venture agreement  in march we paid  for our interest in zhejiang sunmy 
the other parties to the joint venture agreement provided funding for their combined interest 
we have not entered into the sublicense of mn with the joint venture company as of the date of this report 
there is no assurance the sublicense will be executed and there is no assurance that zhejiang sunmy will be able to proceed with the development of mn in china 
a 
zhejiang sunmy is a variable interest entity for which we are not the primary beneficiary as we do not have a majority of the board seats and we will not have power to direct or significantly influence the actions of the entity 
we therefore account for the activities of zhejiang sunmy under the equity method whereby we absorb any loss or income generated by zhejiang sunmy according to our percentage ownership 
at december  we reflect a long term asset on our consolidated balance sheet which represents our investment in zhejiang sunmy  net of our portion of any generated loss or income 
upon completion of proof of concept phase clinical trials  we intend to enter into strategic alliances with leading pharmaceutical or biotech companies who seek late stage product candidates  such as mn  to support further clinical development and product commercialization 
depending on decisions we may make as to further clinical development  we may seek to raise addition capital 
we may also pursue potential partnerships and potential acquirers of license rights to our programs in markets outside the us underwritten firm commitment public offering in march we completed a firm commitment underwritten public offering of  units at a price to the public of per unit for gross proceeds of million

we assessed the deliverables in accordance with the authoritative guidance and concluded the existence of one deliverable  which was research and development services 
under the terms of the agreement  we are responsible for all costs to be incurred in the performance of these services

daily sales of our common stock to aspire are subject to certain limitations and the per share sales price is based on closing stock prices at or near each transaction date 
no more than  shares of our common stock can be issued under this agreement  including the  shares issued to aspire in consideration of entering into the agreement 
our net proceeds will depend on the frequency and number of shares of our common stock sold to aspire and the per share purchase price of each transaction 
as of december   the company had completed sales to aspire totaling  shares of common stock at prices ranging from to per share  generating gross proceeds of million 
between august  and the date of this report  we have generated proceeds of million under the common stock purchase agreement with aspire including proceeds of million on the sale  shares of our common stock subsequent to december  lease of corporate headquarters we leased approximately  square feet of office space at our headquarters at la jolla village drive  suite  san diego  california under a lease that expired on february  on february   we entered into a sublease agreement effective march  the sublease with denali advisors  llc  the sublessor  to which irvine company  the master landlord  has provided its consent

revenues and cost of revenues we recognized approximately  of revenue for the year ending december  and no revenues in the two year period ended december  revenue was recorded in related to the kissei services agreement based on the development services we performed during that period 
all expenses incurred during related to these services were recorded as research and development expenses 
other than the revenue recorded in  our revenues to date have been from development services revenues under service agreements pursuant to which we billed consulting fees and our pass through clinical contract costs 
the primary costs associated with these revenues were clinical contract costs we incurred and passed through to our customers 

table of contents research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of the license fees related to our product candidates  salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with the preclinical and clinical development of our product development programs  costs associated with non clinical activities  such as regulatory expenses  and pre commercialization manufacturing development activities 
we use external service providers to manufacture our compounds to be used in clinical trials and for the majority of the services performed in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates 
research and development expenses include fees paid to consultants  contract research organizations  contract manufacturers and other external service providers  including professional fees and costs associated with legal services  patents and patent applications for our intellectual property 
internal research and development expenses include costs of compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies  facility costs and depreciation 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the periods indicated for each of our product development programs 
to the extent that costs  including personnel costs  are not tracked to a specific product development program  such costs are included in the unallocated category in thousands product candidate disease indication year ended december  mn acute exacerbations of asthma copd mn neurological disorders including opioid withdrawal  methamphetamine addiction  chronic moh pain and ms mn bronchial asthma mn solid tumors mn interstitial cystitis mn urinary incontinence mn thrombotic disorders mn generalized anxiety disorder insomnia mn preterm labor mn thrombotic disorders unallocated total research and development we are currently focusing our development activities on mn  an ibudilast based drug candidate for the treatment of neurological disorders  and obtaining additional funding to advance clinical trial development of mn  a novel  highly selective 

adrenergic receptor agonist being developed for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd 
in may we announced the preliminary trial results of the phase mn cl clinical trial for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma  and in august we announced preliminary trial results of an additional phase b a copd mn cl clinical trial 
on october  we met with the fda to review future development of this product candidate 
the fda identified the risk benefit profile of mn as a focal point for further development of mn and advised that a clinical outcome  such as a reduction in hospitalizations  would need to be a pivotal trial primary endpoint 
we have decided that future mn development will be designed according to the feedback received from the fda 
our research and development expenses may increase in connection with new clinical trials related to mn we have determined that future mn clinical trial development will be partner dependent from a funding perspective 
we will continue to limit our expenditures on the remainder of our existing product candidates to only those activities deemed necessary to maintain our license rights or maximize the value of such product candidates while pursuing a variety of initiatives to monetize such product development 
as a result  we expect that research and development expenses will remain low in future periods for our other product candidates 

table of contents general and administrative our general and administrative costs primarily consist of salaries  benefits and consulting and professional fees related to our administrative  finance  human resources  business development  legal  information systems support functions  facilities and insurance costs 
general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred 
our general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if we are required to expand our infrastructure based on the success of our product development programs and in raising capital to support our product development programs or otherwise in connection with increased business development activities related to partnering  out licensing or product disposition 
other income and expense other income primarily consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
in  other expense primarily consists of accretion related to the convertible notes and the amortization of debt issuance costs paid to third parties and million of interest on our debt 
in  other expense primarily consists of losses from the joint venture and net foreign exchange losses related to vendor invoices denominated in foreign currencies 
we held no debt and had no interest expense in critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to our significant accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting estimates include our recognition of revenue which impacts revenue and deferred revenue  of research and development expenses which impacts operating expenses and accrued liabilities  and stock based compensation which impacts operating expenses 
we review our estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue in october we entered into an agreement with kissei to perform research and development services relating to mn in exchange for a non refundable upfront payment of million 
we assessed the deliverables in accordance with the authoritative guidance and concluded the existence of one deliverable  which was research and development services 
the m was initially recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue was recorded in as the research and development services were delivered 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred based on certain contractual factors such as estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  accruals are adjusted 
to date  our accrued research and development expenses have not differed significantly from the actual expenses incurred 

table of contents stock based compensation we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our amended and restated stock incentive plan 
additionally  we have outstanding stock options that were granted under our general stock incentive plan 
the benefits provided under both of these plans requires stock based compensation for an award of equity instruments  including stock options and employee stock purchase rights issued to employees to be recognized as a cost in the consolidated financial statements 
the cost of these awards is measured according to the grant date fair value of the stock award and is recognized on a straight line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
we occasionally issue employee performance based stock options  the vesting of which is subsequently based on a determination made by the company s board of directors as to the achievement of certain corporate objectives 
the grant date of such awards is the date on which our board of directors makes its determination 
for periods preceding the grant date  the cost of these awards is measured according to their fair value at each reporting date 
in the absence of an observable market price for the stock award  the grant date fair value of the award would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
valuation of our stock option grants require us to estimate certain variables  such as estimated volatility and expected life 
if any of our estimations change  such changes could have a significant impact on the stock based compensation amount we recognize 
goodwill and purchased intangibles goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the identified net tangible and intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions require extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets as a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets that have finite useful lives require the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
we recorded goodwill and ipr d of million and million  respectively  as of december  and our annual test date for goodwill and purchased indefinite life intangibles impairment is december or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment are present 
we periodically re evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of our long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued updated accounting guidance that clarifies existing fair value measurements and disclosures  and eliminates differences between gaap and international financial reporting standards to make convergence guidance more understandable 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in september  the fasb  issued guidance to simplify how entities test for goodwill impairment 
the updated guidance permits an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value 
for reporting units in which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  the updated guidance eliminates the requirement to perform further goodwill impairment testing 
this new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the company adopted guidance issued by the fasb  concerning presentation and disclosure only for the presentation of comprehensive loss income 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations  other than its impact on the presentation of comprehensive loss income 
in august  the fasb issued updated guidance to guidance that permits an assessment of the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value 
this updated guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease in research and development expenses primarily related to a decrease of million in spending on mn primarily due to the completion of the cl clinical trial in march  partially offset by an increase in spending of million for our mn cl clinical trial  and decreases in unallocated employee compensation  occupancy and legal costs totaling million 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to million decrease in employee compensation expense including million related to stock based compensation  and a decrease in professional legal and accounting fees of million

we do not have relationships and transactions with persons and entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments and we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments due to their relatively short term nature 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  were million and were primarily invested in money market interest bearing accounts and money market funds 
a hypothetical adverse change in the average interest rate on our cash and cash equivalents would have had no material effect on net loss for the year ended december
