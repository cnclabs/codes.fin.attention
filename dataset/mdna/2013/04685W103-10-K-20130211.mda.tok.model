overview athenahealth provides business services that help medical caregivers achieve and sustain financial health by collecting more money and exercising more control over their administrative tasks 
these services are designed to reduce the administrative burden of complex billing rules  quality measurement and reporting  clinical documentation and data exchange  patient communication and referrals  and many of the related tasks that distract medical care givers and staff from delivering care 
our services are delivered and consumed through a single instance of our cloud based platform  athenanet 
we differentiate our services by regularly deploying updates and improvements through athenanet to clients without any action on the part of the client 
athenanet enables us to quickly implement our solution at a low up front cost and to seamlessly work in tandem with our clients in real time 
the services provided through our single instance cloud are currently packaged as four integrated components athenacollector for revenue cycle management  athenaclinicals for electronic health record management  athenacommunicator for patient communication management  and athenacoordinator for referral cycle management 
the use of our single instance platform allows all clients to benefit from the collective knowledge of all of our other clients through our patented billing rules engine and our clinical quality management engine 
our clients use these rules engines to monitor and benchmark their performance with peer practices across the network 
complementing athenacollector is our business intelligence offering  anodyne solutions  which provides physicians and practice managers with comprehensive  detailed insight into practice performance  and healthcare data services  which offers practices a better understanding of the cost and quality of the care they provide to their patients 
each service we provide is supported by a model comprised of three distinct components software  knowledge  and work 
the cloud based software is provided at no extra charge to users but is the primary conduit through which we exchange information between clients  payers  and our staff of experts 
knowledge is infused into each of our services via our rules engine as we work with clients  payers  and other partners to codify rules associated with reimbursement  clinical quality measures  and other factors related to our clients performance 
the third component to each of our services is the work that we perform on behalf of our clients 
wherever possible  we replace manual processes with automation  but where automation is not possible  we provide that manual labor rather than returning it to clients to be completed 
this unique service model of software  knowledge  and work has allowed us to align our success with our clients performance  creating a continual cycle of improvement and efficiency 
we charge clients a percentage of collections in most cases  so our financial results are a direct reflection of our ability to drive revenue to medical practices 
for the year ended december   we generated revenue of million from the sale of our services compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  given the scope of our market opportunity  we have increased our spending each year on growth  innovation  and infrastructure 
our revenue is predominately derived from business services that we provide on an ongoing basis 
this revenue is generally determined as a percentage of payments collected by us on behalf of our clients  so the key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of physicians and other medical providers working within our client accounts  the collections of these physicians  and the number of services purchased 
to provide these services  we incur expenses in several categories  including direct operating  selling and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization expense 
in general  our direct operating expense increases as our volume of work increases  whereas our selling and marketing expense increases in proportion to our intended growth rate of adding new accounts to our network of physician clients 
our other expense categories are less directly related to growth of revenues and relate more to our planning for the 
table of contents future  our overall business management activities  and our infrastructure 
we manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity  in adherence to related financial covenants 
recent developments epocrates  inc on january   the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire epocrates  inc epocrates  a leading provider of clinical content to healthcare providers via a mobile device at the point of care

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but are not limited to revenue recognition  including our estimated expected customer life  asset impairments  depreciable lives of assets  fair value of stock options  allocation of direct and indirect expenses  fair value of contingent consideration and acquired intangible assets in a business combination  and litigation reserves 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  and accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained  and as our operating environment changes 
we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations 
actual results could differ from the estimates we have used 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
description judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions revenue recognition we derive our revenue from business services associated with revenue cycle management  electronic health record management  patient communication management  referral cycle management and analytics offerings and from implementation and other services 
our clients typically purchase one year contracts that renew automatically upon completion 
in most cases  our clients may terminate their agreements with days notice without cause 
we typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe 
our clients are billed monthly  in arrears  based either upon a percentage of collections posted to athenanet  minimum fees  flat fees  or per claim fees where applicable 
invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the subsequent month and delivered to clients primarily by email 
for most of our clients  fees are then deducted from a pre defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto debit transaction 
amounts that have been accrued are recorded as revenue or deferred revenue  as appropriate  and are included in our accounts receivable balances 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the client  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable 
all revenue  other than implementation revenue  is recognized when the service is performed 
relative to our business services offering that is based on the collections of amounts by our customers  we do not recognize revenue until our customers have been paid 
each deliverable within a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit if both of the following criteria are met the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
we consider a deliverable to have standalone value if we sell this item separately or if the item is sold by another vendor or could be resold by the customer 
further  our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products 
deliverables not meeting the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion 
the appropriate allocation of arrangement consideration and recognition of revenue is then determined for the combined unit of accounting 
if and when we are not able to deliver all separate units of account in the same period  we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material 
description judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we recognize our non refundable up front fees over the contract term or estimated expected customer life  whichever is longer 
as the implementation service is not separable from the ongoing business services  we record implementation fees as deferred revenue until the implementation service is complete  at which time we recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the longer of the estimated expected customer life or contract life 
the determination of the amount of revenue we can recognize each accounting period requires management to make estimates and judgments on the estimated expected customer life 
we determined the estimated customer life considering the following key factors renewal rate considerations economic life of the product or service industry data the estimated customer life  or expected performance period  for the years presented is years 
our estimate of expected performance period may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period 
for example  if in the future  we need to increase our estimated expected performance period to a period longer than years  the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would decrease 
on the other hand  if in the future  we need to decrease our estimated expected performance period to a period shorter than years  the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would increase 
the amount of deferred revenue related to non refundable up front fees is million as of december  description judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions business combinations purchased intangibles and contingent consideration business combinations  including purchased intangibles and contingent consideration  are accounted for at fair value 
acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in general and administrative expenses 
all changes to purchase accounting that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 
the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business  the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets  estimated useful lives of these intangible assets and a probability weighted income approach based on scenarios in estimating achievement of operating results and earn out targets related to estimating the value of the contingent considerations 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
we review acquired intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain acquisitions to their then fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as a reduction of contingent consideration expense 
future business and economic conditions  as well as differences actually related to any of the assumptions  could materially impact the financial statements through impairment of goodwill and intangibles  acceleration of the amortization period of the purchased intangibles which are finite lived assets or changes in fair value of the contingent consideration from the date of acquisition 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in the estimates of earn out results 
we have million and million carrying amount of goodwill and purchased intangibles  as of december   respectively 
we have a liability of million of contingent consideration related to million in potential payments as of december   related to the proxsys business combinations cross sell earn out 
for the initial purchase price allocation  we estimated the fair value of this contingent consideration related to the proxsys acquisition in august of to be million 
to date  we have paid out an insignificant amount and decreased the fair value by million 
financial operations overview revenue 
we derive our revenue from two sources from business services associated with our revenue cycle management  electronic health record management  patient communication management  referral cycle management and analytics offerings and from implementation and other services 
implementation and other revenue consist primarily of professional services fees related to assisting clients with the initial implementation of our services and for ongoing training and related support services 
business services accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  and business services revenue are typically to of a practice s total collections depending upon the services purchased  the size  complexity  and other characteristics of the practice  plus a per statement charge for billing statements that are generated for patients 
accordingly  business services revenue is largely driven by the number of physician practices and other service providers we serve  the number of physicians and other medical providers working in those physician practices  the volume of activity and related collections of those physicians  the mix of our services used by those physician practices and other medical providers  and our contracted rates 
there is moderate seasonality in the activity level of physician practices 
typically  discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season  which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about to days later 
additionally  the volume of activity and related collections vary from year to year based in large part on the severity  length and timing of the onset of the flu season 
while we believe that the severity  length and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season will continue to impact collections by our physician clients  there can be no assurance that our future sales of these services will necessarily follow historical patterns 
implementation and other revenue are largely driven by the increase in the volume of our new business 
as a result  we expect implementation and other revenue to increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total 
table of contents revenue 
none of our clients accounted for more than of our total revenues for the years ended december    and direct operating expense 
direct operating expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits  claim processing costs  other direct expenses  and stock based compensation related to personnel who provide services to clients  including staff who implement new clients 
we expense implementation costs as incurred 
we include in direct operating expense all service costs associated with athenacollector  athenaclinicals  athenacommunicator  athenacoordinator  anodyne solutions and healthcare data services 
we expect to increase our overall level of automation as we become a larger operation  with higher volumes of work in particular functions  geographies  and medical specialties 
although we expect that direct operating expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future  the direct operating expense is expected to decline as a percentage of revenue as we increase automation 
direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent  occupancy and other indirect costs including building maintenance and utilities  depreciation  and amortization  except for amortization related to purchased intangible assets 
selling and marketing expense 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of marketing programs including trade shows  brand messaging  and on line initiatives and personnel related expense for sales and marketing employees including salaries  benefits  commissions  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expenses 
although we recognize substantially all of our revenue when services have been delivered  we recognize a large portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and at the time our services commence 
accordingly  we incur a portion of our sales and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue 
we have increased our sales and marketing expenses from year to year and we expect to continue to increase our investment in sales and marketing by hiring additional direct sales personnel and support personnel to add new clients and increase sales to our existing clients and expand awareness through paid search and other similar initiatives 
we also plan to expand our marketing activities  such as attending trade shows  expanding user groups  and creating new printed materials 
as a result  we expect that  in the near term  sales and marketing expense will increase in line with revenue growth 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses for research and development employees including salaries  benefits  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expenses and consulting fees for third party developers 
we expect that  in the near term  research and development expenditures will increase in absolute terms and will likely remain consistent as a percent of revenue as we develop and enhance new and existing services  however the amount of expenditures that should be capitalized as software development costs versus expensed as research and development could vary based on the specific projects we undertake 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expense for administrative employees including salaries  benefits  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense  occupancy and other indirect costs including building maintenance and utilities  and insurance premiums  and  outside professional fees for accountants  lawyers  external costs associated with acquisitions  change in the fair value of contingent consideration and consultants 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute terms as we invest in infrastructure to support our growth 
though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms  we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of capitalized software development and acquisition costs  which we amortize over a two to three year period from the time of release of related software code 
as we grow  we will continue to make capital investments in the infrastructure of the business and we will continue to develop software that we capitalize 
in the near term we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase as a percentage of total revenue 
other income expense 
interest income represents earnings from our cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
we currently do not have any debt outstanding and therefore have insignificant expense related to debt issuance costs associated with our credit facility 
we expect that in the near term our interest expense will substantially increase as we anticipate that we will need to borrow to fund a portion of the two proposed acquisitions discussed in the recent developments section 
income tax provision 
income tax provision consists of federal and state income taxes in the united states and india 
the difference between our effective tax rate and our statutory rate is mainly related to any changes in the fair value of contingent considerations related to non tax deductible goodwill  the treatment of incentive stock options isos and the impact of certain tax deduction limits related to certain of our highly compensated officers 
the changes in fair value of contingent consideration related to non tax deductible goodwill and the treatment of disqualifying dispositions related to isos are also treated as discrete items which means they are recorded in the quarter in which they occur and could cause significant differences between the quarterly and annual effective tax rate 
also  we substantially ceased issuing isos in  but we expect continued volatility related to these options since we cannot anticipate when disqualifying dispositions related to these options will occur 
in the first quarter of  we expect to receive a discrete tax benefit to our provision related to research

general and administrative expense for the year ended december   included an increase of million in legal  audit  tax  consulting  external costs associated with acquisitions and insurance expenses along with an increase of million in travel expenses  recruiting and corporate events 
these increases are offset by a decrease in the provision for uncollectible accounts of million due to less accounts requiring higher reserve percentages due to increased collection activity and a decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration of million

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments of million 
our cash investments consist of corporate debt securities  bank certificate of deposits  and commercial paper 
as specified in our investment policy  we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  the policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns 
as of december   we have no outstanding indebtedness 
on october   we entered into a credit agreement which provides for a five year million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility may be increased by up to an additional million on the satisfaction of certain conditions including obtaining lender commitments 
there was no balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility during the year ended december  the credit facility contains certain covenants  including consolidated leverage ratio and minimum fixed charges coverage ratios 
the interest rates applicable to revolving loans under the credit agreement are at either i the british bankers association london interbank offered rate libor plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio  or ii the base rate which is the highest of a the bank s prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus  and c one month libor plus plus an interest margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
we will pay a commitment fee during the term of the credit agreement which varies between and depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
in connection with the proposed acquisition of epocrates  on january   we borrowed million from our credit facility and  on january   we repaid the borrowed amount in full 
on january   we entered into a commitment letter  pursuant to which bank of america  na committed to increase its commitment to provide revolving loans under our credit facility by an amount up to million as a source of funding for the epocrates transaction 
during the first half of  we anticipate amending our existing credit facility and incurring debt in order to help finance the two proposed acquisitions discussed in the recent developments section 
we believe our current and these future sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations  to finance our strategic initiatives  to make payments on our contractual obligations  as well as to purchase property and equipment and to finance the two pending transactions in the foreseeable future 

table of contents our analysis is supported by the growth in our new customer base and a high rate of renewal with our existing customers and the corresponding increase in billings and collections 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under these credit facilities or obtain additional financing 
commitments we enter into various purchase commitments with vendors in the normal course of business 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund these purchases during the year in the normal course of business  we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients 
historically  there has been no material losses related to such guarantees 
operating cash flow activities year ended december  net income non cash adjustments cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities the increase in cash flow from operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   is mainly attributable to the actual and proportionate increase in the amount of non cash adjustments compared to the net income for those periods 
the non cash adjustments include an increase of stock based compensation of million and depreciation and amortization of million offset by a decrease in the change in fair value of the contingent consideration of million when comparing these periods 
the increase in stock based compensation is a result of an increase in the fair value of recently issued stock based awards due to an increase in the stock price 
we continue to offset our portion of our income tax assessments with net operating losses from stock based compensation from prior years and tax benefits from current year exercises as shown by the excess tax benefit amounts 
we no longer have significant net operating losses from prior years and expect the amount of taxes paid will increase in future years 
the year over year decrease in cash used in operating assets and liabilities is mainly driven by the change in deferred revenue 
the increase in the deferred revenue balance of million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december   is primarily due to the fact that we began waiving implementation fees for remote implementations and for some sales offerings 
investing cash flow activities the cash used by investing activities decreased million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment  capitalized software development costs  and our investment activities 
we make investments in property and equipment and in software development on an ongoing basis 
our investment in equipment consists primarily of purchases of technology infrastructure to provide service stability and additional capacity to support our expanding client base 
our increase of million in equipment is primarily related to several new servers for our new data center located in dallas  texas and existing data centers located in bedford  massachusetts  and belfast  maine  as well as build out of new leasehold and building improvements to accommodate our headcount growth 
our investment in software development consists of company managed design  development  and testing of new application functionality 
our capitalized software development costs increased by million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily related to the new automation activities related to the new athenacoordinator service offering as well as our athenaclinicals service offering 
the change of restricted cash is due to the timing of the payments made for contingent consideration relating to the anodyne acquisition completed in in the year ended december   we acquired healthcare data services  llc for million 
in the year ended december   we acquired a conference center located in maine for million and proxsys for million 
the net change in proceeds and purchases of our available for sale investments is based upon the changes in maturity of our investments in securities 
we decreased the amount of available for sale investments at december   in anticipation of the proposed acquisition of epocrates and the arsenal on the charles property that we anticipate will both close in the first half of 
table of contents financing cash flow activities the cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the change is primarily attributable to the million payment related to our debt and interest rate swap in we elected to repay all of our outstanding debt balances under our equipment line of credit and term loan  as well as terminate our related interest rate derivative in may the increase of million in cash received from the exercise of stock options during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   is primarily due to the overall increase in the strike price of the options exercised along with an increase in the number of options exercised during the comparable time periods 
this increase was offset by an increase of million related to the cash paid to settle tax obligations through the net settlement method that our employees can elect when restricted stock units vest in the year ended december  we began issuing restricted stock units in and have since experienced an increase in the proportionate number of restricted stock units granted compared to options granted 
we expect that the cash paid to settle tax obligations will increase in the near future as these issued restricted stock units begin to vest 
the payment of contingent consideration relates to the portion of the anodyne contingent consideration that was accrued at acquisition date 
we expect that our cash flows from financing activities will increase in the near future as we anticipate that we will need to borrow to fund the pending transactions discussed in the recent developments section 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations under our operating leases for properties 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years after years other operating lease obligations other total the commitments under our operating leases shown above consist primarily of lease payments for our watertown  massachusetts  headquarters  our rome  georgia  offices  our alpharetta  georgia  offices  our birmingham  alabama  offices  our austin  texas  offices  and our chennai  india  offices 
at december   million of the million relates to lease payments for our watertown  massachusetts  headquarters  see the recent developments section 
other amount consists of uncertain tax benefits 
we have not utilized these uncertain tax benefits  nor do we have an expectation of when these uncertain tax benefits would be challenged 
as of december   we cannot reasonably estimate when any future cash outlays would occur related to these uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
other than our operating leases for office space  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the indian rupee 
none of our consolidated revenues are generated outside the united states 
none of our vendor relationships  including our contracts with our offshore service providers international business machines corporation and vision business process solutions  inc  a subsidiary of dell  inc formerly perot systems corporation  for work performed in india and the philippines  is denominated in any currency other than the us dollar 
for the year ended december   less than of our expenses occurred in our direct subsidiary in chennai  india  and was incurred in indian rupees 
we therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments totaling million at december  these amounts are held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in deposits  money market funds  and short term and long term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
due to the short and expected term of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment 
table of contents portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
the value of these securities  however  will be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates rise 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had no outstanding long term debt and capital lease obligations and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility
