us gaap establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker  or decision making group  in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance 
our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer 
we have six operating segments based on the information reviewed by our chief executive officer us rental and cleaning  canadian rental and cleaning  manufacturing mfg  specialty garments rental and cleaning specialty garments  first aid and corporate 
the us rental and cleaning and canadian rental and cleaning operating segments have been combined to form the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment 
refer to note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements for our disclosure of segment information 
the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment purchases  rents  cleans  delivers and sells  uniforms and protective clothing and non garment items in the united states and canada 
the operations of the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment are referred to by us as our industrial laundry operations and we refer to the locations related to this reporting segment as our industrial laundries 
the mfg operating segment designs and manufactures uniforms and non garment items primarily for the purpose of providing these goods to the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment 
the amounts reflected as revenues of mfg are generated when goods are shipped from our manufacturing facilities  or subcontract manufacturers  to our other locations 
these revenues are recorded at a transfer price which is typically in excess of the actual manufacturing cost 
products are carried in inventory and subsequently placed in service and amortized at this transfer price 
on a consolidated basis  intercompany mfg revenues and mfg income are eliminated and the carrying value of inventories and rental merchandise in service is reduced to the manufacturing cost 
income before income taxes from mfg  net of the intercompany mfg elimination  offsets the merchandise amortization costs incurred by the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment as the merchandise costs of this reporting segment are amortized and recognized based on inventories purchased from mfg at the transfer price which is above our manufacturing cost 
the corporate operating segment consists of costs associated with our distribution center  sales and marketing  information systems  engineering  materials management  manufacturing planning  finance  budgeting  human resources  other general and administrative costs and interest expense 
the revenues generated from the corporate operating segment represent certain direct sales made directly from our distribution center 
the products sold by this operating segment are the same products rented and sold by the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment 
in the segment disclosures in note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements  no assets or capital expenditures are presented for the corporate operating segment as no assets are allocated to this operating segment in the information reviewed by our chief executive officer 
however  depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets are reflected in income from operations and income before income taxes for the corporate operating segment 
the assets that give rise to this depreciation and amortization are included in the total assets of the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment as this is how they are tracked and reviewed by us 
we refer to our us and canadian rental and cleaning  mfg  and corporate segments combined as our core laundry operations 
the specialty garments operating segment purchases  rents  cleans  delivers and sells  specialty garments and non garment items primarily for nuclear and cleanroom applications and provides cleanroom cleaning services at limited customer locations 
the first aid operating segment sells first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies as well as maintains wholesale distribution and pill packaging operations 
approximately of our revenues in fiscal were derived from us and canadian rental and cleaning  and corporate 
a key driver of this business is the number of workers employed by our customers 
our revenues are directly impacted by fluctuations in these employment levels 
revenues from specialty garments  which accounted for of our revenues  increase during outages and refueling by nuclear power plants  as garment usage increases at these times 
first aid represented of our total revenue in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on historical information  current trends  and information available from other sources 
the actual results could differ from our estimates 
foreign currency translation the functional currency of our foreign operations is the local country s currency 
transaction gains and losses  including gains and losses on our intercompany transactions  are included in other expense income  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
assets and liabilities of operations outside the united states are translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates 
revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each month of the fiscal year 
the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided 
direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are performed or when the product is shipped 
our judgment and estimates are used in determining the collectability of accounts receivable and evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we consider specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances as part of our evaluation 
changes in our estimates are reflected in the period they become known 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material changes in our estimates may result in significant differences in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period 
our revenues do not include taxes we collect from our customers and remit to governmental authorities 
inventories and rental merchandise in service our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  net of any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to our customers or used in our rental operations 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than the amount we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we use the first in  first out fifo method to value our inventories  which primarily consist of finished goods 
rental merchandise in service is being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated service lives of the merchandise  which range from to months 
in establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service  our management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if we make significant changes to our estimates 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets in accordance with us gaap  we do not amortize goodwill 
instead  current accounting guidance requires that companies test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
in addition  us gaap requires that companies test goodwill if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount 
our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment  competitive information  market trends  operating performance and cash flow modeling 
we complete our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and there have been no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets in fiscal  or we cannot predict future economic conditions and their impact on the company or the future market value of our stock 
a decline in our market capitalization and or deterioration in general economic conditions could negatively and materially impact our assumptions and assessment of the fair value of our business 
if general economic conditions or our financial performance deteriorate  we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge in the future which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
property  plant and equipment  and definite lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimates of the period that the assets will generate economic benefits 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired 
there were no material impairments of property  plant and equipment  or definite lived intangible assets in fiscal  or insurance we self insure for certain obligations related to health  workers compensation  vehicles and general liability programs 
we also purchase stop loss insurance policies to protect ourselves from catastrophic losses 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for events that have occurred  but have not been reported 
our estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors 
our liabilities are based on our estimates  and  while we believe that our accruals are adequate  the ultimate liability may be significantly different from the amounts recorded 
changes in our claim experience  our ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments we use could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any given period 
environmental and other contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations  including environmental matters  personal injury  customer contract matters and employment claims 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
we regularly consult with our attorneys and outside consultants  in our consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances  before recording a contingent liability 
we record accruals for environmental and other contingencies based on enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  our estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties  the timing of payments  and the input of our attorneys and outside consultants 
the estimated liability for environmental contingencies has been discounted as of august  using risk free interest rates ranging from to over periods ranging from ten to thirty years 
the estimated current costs  net of legal settlements with insurance carriers  have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year 
changes in enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  our estimates of costs  risk free interest rates  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties  the timing of payments and the input of our attorneys and outside consultants based on changing legal or factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  of our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion and analysis 
asset retirement obligations under us gaap  asset retirement obligations generally apply to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
current accounting guidance requires that we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
we have recognized as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission our nuclear laundry facilities in accordance with us gaap 
we depreciate  on a straight line basis  the amount added to property  plant and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the various remaining lives which range from approximately eight to thirty one years 
our estimated liability has been based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities  estimated useful lives of the underlying assets  external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future  and federal and state regulatory requirements 
the estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year 
the liability has been discounted using credit adjusted risk free rates that range from approximately to 
revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets  estimated dates of decommissioning  changes in decommissioning costs  changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities  or other changes in estimates 
changes due to revisions in our estimates will be recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long lived asset if the assets are still in service  or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service 
derivative financial instruments us gaap requires that all our derivative instruments be recorded as other assets or other liabilities at fair value 
all subsequent changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized in income  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
cash flows associated with derivatives are classified in the same category as the cash flows hedged in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are classified as a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be paid related to a recognized liability or a forecasted transaction 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until expense from the cash flows of the hedged items are recognized 
we perform an assessment at the inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter  to determine whether our derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items 
any changes in the fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness  is immediately recognized as income or expense 
our hedging activities are transacted only with highly rated institutions  which reduces our exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance 
as of august  and august   we had no outstanding derivative instruments 
supplemental executive retirement plan and other pension plans we recognize pension expense on an accrual basis over our employees estimated service periods 
pension expense is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires us to use of a number of critical assumptions  including the expected long term rates of return on plan assets  the assumed discount rate  the assumed rate of compensation increases and life expectancy of participants 
changes in our assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual expense can differ from these assumptions 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
income taxes we compute income tax expense by jurisdiction based on our operations in each jurisdiction 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes at currently enacted tax rates 
we are periodically reviewed by us domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews typically include inquiries regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating our exposure associated with various filing positions  we have recorded estimated reserves 
refer to note  income taxes  of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our accounting for income taxes and uncertain tax positions for financial accounting purposes 
we have undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries of approximately million  million and million as of august   august  and august   respectively 
we consider these undistributed earnings as indefinitely reinvested and therefore have not provided for us income taxes or foreign withholding taxes 
if these earnings were ultimately distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  or if the shares of our international subsidiaries were sold or transferred  we would likely be subject to additional us income taxes  net of the impact of any available foreign tax credits as well as foreign withholding taxes 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred us taxes on these undistributed earnings

we also rent industrial wiping products  floor mats  facility service products  other non garment items  and provide first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies  to a variety of manufacturers  retailers and service companies 
we have five reporting segments  us and canadian rental and cleaning  manufacturing mfg  corporate  specialty garments rental and cleaning specialty garments  and first aid 
we refer to the us and canadian rental and cleaning  mfg  and corporate reporting segments combined as our core laundry operations 
cost of revenues include merchandise costs related to the amortization of rental merchandise in service and direct sales as well as labor and other production  service and delivery costs  and distribution costs associated with operating our core laundry operations  specialty garments facilities  and first aid locations 
selling and administrative costs include costs related to our sales and marketing functions as well as general and administrative costs associated with our corporate offices and operating locations including information systems  engineering  materials management  manufacturing planning  finance  budgeting  and human resources 
the price of fuel and energy needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control  including geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by opec and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries  regional production patterns  limits on refining capacities  natural disasters and environmental concerns 
increases in fuel costs could impact our financial results 
the current worldwide economic uncertainty may negatively impact our revenues and operating performance in fiscal and beyond due to the impact on spending plans and employment levels of our customers and sales prospects 
throughout fiscal  us and canadian unemployment rates remained high  which had a negative effect on wearer levels and  as a result  on our business 
fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  revenues august  august  dollar percent change change in thousands  except percentages core laundry operations specialty garments first aid total consolidated revenues in fiscal  our consolidated revenues increased by million from the comparable period in  or 
fiscal had weeks of operations compared to weeks in fiscal the extra week in fiscal accounted for revenue growth of compared to fiscal our year over year increase in consolidated revenues was primarily driven by a million increase in our core laundry operations 
core laundry revenues increased to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to positive organic growth of 
organic growth is comprised of new sales  additions to our existing customer base and price increases  offset by lost accounts and reductions to our existing customer base 
organic growth in fiscal benefited from new account sales as well as certain annual price adjustments 
our revenues in fiscal also benefitted from higher collections of merchandise recovery charges compared to fiscal strong growth in our flame resistant product line also contributed to our top line gains in fiscal partially offsetting these positive factors  wearer levels at our existing accounts were lower in fiscal than in fiscal  which reflects the impact of continued high unemployment 
the positive organic growth in our core laundry operations was accompanied by positive acquisition related growth of as well as the impact of the extra week of operations which accounted for approximately of core laundry revenue growth 
specialty garments revenue decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  or 
the decrease was primarily the result of the completion of two large power reactor rebuild projects in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by the impact of an extra week of operations 
first aid revenues increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was the result of improved performance from each of the segment s operations ie  wholesale distribution  pill packaging  and van based operations as well as the impact of the extra week of operations 
cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased from of revenues  or million  in fiscal to of revenues  or million  in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower merchandise  energy and payroll costs as a percentage of revenues in our core laundry operations  primarily due to the revenue growth this segment experienced 
in addition  the company benefited from lower bad debt expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal these lower costs as a percentage of revenues were partially offset by an increase in the cost of revenues for the specialty garments segment as a percentage of revenues due to the revenue contraction that segment experienced during fiscal selling and administrative expense our selling and administrative expenses increased to of revenues  or million  in fiscal from of revenues  or million  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to a settlement we entered into during fiscal related to environmental litigation 
as a result of the settlement  we recognized a gain in the third quarter of fiscal of approximately million 
excluding the effect of this settlement  selling and administrative costs would have decreased from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower selling and administrative payroll costs as a percentage of revenues 
in addition  the comparisons of fiscal to fiscal benefited from certain costs we incurred in fiscal associated with our company wide initiative to update our customer relationship management system 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expense was million  or of revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased due to capital expenditure and acquisition activity but decreased as a percentage of revenues due to the revenue growth we experienced in fiscal income from operations for the year ended august   the changes in revenues in our core laundry operations  specialty garments and first aid segments  as well as the changes in our costs discussed above  resulted in the following changes in our income from operations august  august  dollar percent change change in thousands  except percentages core laundry operations specialty garments first aid total consolidated income from operations percentage of total revenues other income expense other income expense  which includes interest expense  interest income and foreign currency exchange loss gain  was income of million for fiscal as compared to an expense of million for fiscal the change was primarily due to higher net interest income in fiscal of million compared to net interest income of million in fiscal this increase in income was the result of a decrease in the interest rates affecting our variable rate debt as well as higher cash balances earning interest income 
in addition  we experienced a foreign currency exchange rate loss of million in fiscal compared to a foreign currency exchange rate loss of million in fiscal provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal our tax rate in fiscal was higher than fiscal primarily due to the reversal in fiscal of certain tax contingency reserves as well as million of tax expense that we recognized in fiscal related to non deductible compensation

organic growth in fiscal was impacted by strong new accounts sales as well as an improved overall pricing environment 
strong growth in our flame resistant and high visibility product lines also contributed to our top line gains 
wearer levels at our existing accounts for the year were effectively flat  which reflects the impact of continued high unemployment 
the positive organic growth in our core laundry operations was accompanied by positive acquisition related growth of and was partially offset by the effect of an unfavorable fluctuation in the canadian foreign exchange rate  which accounted for a decrease in revenue during fiscal year specialty garments revenue decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  or

liquidity and capital resources general for the fiscal year ended august   we had a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
as of august   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalent balances  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our credit agreement defined below will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
for fiscal  we anticipate that that our capital expenditure investment will be between million and million which will be impacted by our continued investment in our project to update our customer relationship management system 
sources and uses of cash during the fiscal year ended august   we generated cash from operating activities of million resulting primarily from net income of million  net of non cash amounts for depreciation  amortization and accretion of million and share based compensation of million 
we also generated cash as a result of a decrease in inventories of million  a decrease in rental merchandise in service of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  the company s cash position also benefited from a change in tax regulations impacting the timing of deductions allowable for certain merchandise in service 
these inflows were partially offset by an increase in receivables of million  an increase in prepaid expenses of million and a decrease in accrued income taxes of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal we used cash during fiscal to invest million in capital expenditures  of which million related to our ongoing project to update our customer relationship management system  as well as fund the acquisition of businesses in the amount of approximately million 
in addition  we remitted million in taxes in fiscal which were withheld in the form of common stock and related to the vesting of equity awards 
as of august   we have accumulated million in cash outside the united states that is expected to be invested indefinitely outside the united states 
if these funds were distributed to the us in the form of dividends  the company would be subject to additional us income taxes 
long term debt and borrowing capacity on may   we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks  which matures on may  under the credit agreement  we are able to borrow funds at variable interest rates based on  at our election  the eurodollar rate or a base rate  plus in each case a spread based on our consolidated funded debt ratio 
availability of credit requires compliance with certain financial and other covenants  including a maximum consolidated funded debt ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
we test our compliance with these financial covenants on a fiscal quarterly basis 
at august   the interest rates applicable to our borrowings under the credit agreement would be calculated as libor plus basis points at the time of the respective borrowing 
as of august   we had no outstanding borrowings  letters of credit amounting to million and million available for borrowing under the credit agreement 
prior to may   we had a million unsecured revolving credit agreement the prior credit agreement with a syndicate of banks  which was scheduled to mature on september  in connection with our entry into the credit agreement  we terminated the prior credit agreement 
on june   we issued million of fixed rate notes fixed rate notes pursuant to a note purchase agreement with a seven year term and bearing interest at 
the fixed rate notes matured on june  and were repaid with approximately million from our cash reserves and million of borrowing under our credit agreement 
on september   we issued million of floating rates notes floating rate notes pursuant to a note purchase agreement note agreement  which bore interest at libor plus basis points 
on september   the floating rate notes matured and were repaid with million from our cash reserves 
as of august   we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement and the note agreement 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and the related effect on our variable rate debt 
the swap agreement  with a notional amount of million  matured on march  we paid a fixed rate of and received a variable rate tied to the three month libor rate 
we accounted for this instrument as a cash flow hedge in accordance with us gaap and  as a result  recorded all changes in the fair value of the swap agreement in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
environmental and legal contingencies we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances 
in particular  industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues  and  in the past  used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents 
we are attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and have  through the years  taken measures to avoid their improper disposal 
over the years  we have settled  or contributed to the settlement of  actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future 
us gaap requires that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
we regularly consult with attorneys and outside consultants in our consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances before recording a contingent liability 
changes in enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  management s estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties  the timing of payments and the input of outside consultants and attorneys based on changing legal or factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for environmental and other contingent liabilities 
under environmental laws  an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on  or in  or emanating from such property  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
there can be no assurances that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon our company under such laws or expose our company to third party actions such as tort suits 
we continue to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to sites located in or related to woburn  massachusetts  somerville  massachusetts  springfield  massachusetts  uvalde  texas  stockton  california  three sites related to former operations in williamstown  vermont  as well as sites located in goldsboro  north carolina  wilmington  north carolina and landover  maryland 
we have accrued certain costs related to the sites described above as it has been determined that the costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we continue to implement mitigation measures and to monitor environmental conditions at the somerville  massachusetts site 
we also have potential exposure related to an additional parcel of land the central area related to the woburn  massachusetts site discussed above 
currently  the consent decree for the woburn site does not define or require any remediation work in the central area 
the united states environmental protection agency the epa has provided us and other signatories to the consent decree with comments on the design and implementation of groundwater and soil remedies at the woburn site and investigation of environmental conditions in the central area 
we  and other signatories  have implemented and proposed to do additional work at the woburn site but many of the epa s comments remain to be resolved 
we have accrued costs to perform certain work responsive to epa comments 
in addition  we have received notices of violations from region of the epa under the clean air act regarding our failure to obtain certain permits allegedly necessary with respect to the laundering of soiled towels at seven new england facilities  and we are addressing these matters 
we believe that it is probable that region of the epa may seek to impose penalties against us in connection with these seven new england facilities  but we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount of the penalties that may be sought 
we routinely review and evaluate sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determine our estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions 
these estimates are developed using our internal sources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
internally developed estimates are based on management s judgment and experience in remediating and monitoring our sites  information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation and monitoring  the number  financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other potentially responsible parties prps who may be liable for remediation and monitoring of a specific site  and the typical allocation of costs among prps 
there is usually a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with each site 
our accruals represent the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate 
when we believe that both the amount of a particular liability and the timing of the payments are reliably determinable  we adjust the cost in current dollars using a rate of for inflation until the time of expected payment and discount the cost to present value using current risk free interest rates 
as of august   the risk free interest rates we utilized ranged from to 
for environmental liabilities that have been discounted  we include interest accretion  based on the effective interest method  in selling and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
the changes to the amounts of our environmental liabilities for the years ended august  and august  are as follows in thousands year ended august  august  beginning balance costs incurred for which reserves have been provided insurance proceeds received interest accretion changes in discount rates revisions in estimates ending balance anticipated payments and insurance proceeds of currently identified environmental remediation liabilities as of august  for the next five fiscal years and thereafter  as measured in current dollars  are reflected below in thousands 
fiscal year ended august thereafter total estimated costs current dollars estimated insurance proceeds net anticipated costs effect of inflation effect of discounting balance as of august  estimated insurance proceeds are primarily received from an annuity received as part of our legal settlement with an insurance company 
annual proceeds of approximately million are deposited into an escrow account which funds remediation and monitoring costs for three sites related to our former operations in williamstown  vermont 
annual proceeds received but not expended in the current year accumulate in this account and may be used in future years for costs related to this site through the year as of august   the balance in this escrow account  which is held in a trust and is not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet  was approximately million 
also included in estimated insurance proceeds are amounts we are entitled to receive pursuant to legal settlements as reimbursements from three insurance companies for estimated costs at the site in uvalde  texas 
our nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  or  in certain cases  by the applicable state agency  and are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
there can be no assurance that such regulation will not lead to material disruptions in our garment decontamination business 
from time to time  we are also subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations  including litigation related to charges for certain ancillary services on invoices  personal injury claims  customer contract matters  employment claims and environmental matters as described above 
while it is impossible for us to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities  including lawsuits and environmental contingencies  we believe that the aggregate amount of such liabilities  if any  in excess of amounts covered by insurance have been properly accrued in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
it is possible  however  that the future financial position and or results of operations for any particular future period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of our control 
in addition  on december   we received a letter from counsel for new england compounding center necc demanding  among other things  that we indemnify necc regarding claims made against necc  including those related to necc s highly publicized compounding and sale of tainted methylprednisolone acetate 
this demand relates to the limited  once a month cleaning services we provided to portions of necc s cleanroom facilities 
based on our preliminary review of this matter  we believe that necc s claims are without merit 
we have notified our insurers of claims associated with this matter and preliminary discussions concerning coverage are ongoing 
in june  we received a subpoena from the plaintiffs steering committee psc appointed in conjunction with the necc multi district litigation proceeding seeking information relating to the necc matter 
during august  we responded to the psc regarding the subpoena 
on september   we entered into a tolling agreement with the psc which  among other things  tolled defenses based on statutes of limitations with respect to certain claimants 
to date  a significant number of lawsuits have been brought against necc and other defendants from persons who were allegedly harmed as a result of necc s compounds 
through the date of this filing  these lawsuits have not named us as a defendant 
based partially on communication with the psc  we believe that over the course of the next year we may face a number of lawsuits related to this matter 
while we are unable to ascertain the ultimate outcome of this matter  based on the information currently available  we believe that a loss with respect to this matter is neither probable nor remote  and we are unable to reasonably assess an estimate or range of estimates of any potential losses 
if we are found to be liable with respect to claims brought against us relating to necc that are not covered by our insurance  we may incur liabilities that are material to our financial condition and operating results 
acquisitions as part of our business  we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other garment service companies 
in recent years  we have typically paid for acquisitions with cash and may continue to do so in the future 
to pay for an acquisition  we may use cash on hand  cash generated from operations or borrowings under our credit agreement  or we may pursue other forms of debt financing 
our ability to secure short term and long term debt financing in the future will depend on several factors  including our future profitability  our levels of debt and equity  and the overall credit and equity market environments 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following information is presented as of august  in thousands 
payments due by fiscal period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years floating rate notes other debt total debt retirement plan benefit payments operating leases total contractual cash obligations in september  we repaid all of the outstanding floating rate notes utilizing cash on hand 
we have uncertain tax positions that are reserved totaling million as of august  that are excluded from the above table as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
as discussed above under long term debt and borrowing capacity  as of august   we had borrowing capacity of million under our credit agreement  of which approximately million was available for borrowing 
also  as of such date  we had no outstanding borrowings and letters of credit outstanding of million 
all letters of credit expire in less than one year 
off balance sheet arrangements at august  and august   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of securities and exchange commission regulation s k 
seasonality historically  our revenues and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations have been due to a number of factors  including general economic conditions in our markets  the timing of acquisitions and of commencing start up operations and related costs  our effectiveness in integrating acquired businesses and start up operations  the timing of nuclear plant outages  capital expenditures  seasonal rental and purchasing patterns of our customers  and price changes in response to competitive factors 
in addition  our operating results historically have been lower during the second and fourth fiscal quarters than during the other quarters of the fiscal year 
the operating results for any historical quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for an entire fiscal year or any other interim periods 
effects of inflation in general  we believe that our results of operations are not dependent on moderate changes in the inflation rate 
historically  we have been able to manage the impacts of more significant changes in inflation rates through our customer relationships  customer agreements that generally provide for price increases consistent with the rate of inflation  and continued focus on improvements of operational productivity 
energy costs significant increases in energy costs  specifically with respect to natural gas and gasoline  can materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
during fiscal  our energy costs  which include fuel  natural gas  and electricity  represented approximately of our total revenue

in september  the fasb issued updated guidance intended to simplify how entities  both public and nonpublic  test for goodwill impairment 
this guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
also  the guidance improves the examples of events and circumstances that an entity having a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount should consider in determining whether to measure an impairment loss  if any  under the second step of the goodwill impairment test

this guidance was effective for annual reporting periods  and any interim periods within those annual periods  that begin after december  and is to be applied prospectively  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have determined that all of our foreign subsidiaries operate primarily in local currencies that represent the functional currencies of such subsidiaries 
all assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of assets and liabilities are recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each month of the fiscal year 
as such  our financial condition and operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to currencies in foreign countries 
revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented approximately  and of total consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended august   august  and august   respectively 
total assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented approximately  and of total consolidated assets at august   august  and august   respectively 
if exchange rates had increased or decreased by from the actual rates in effect during the year ended august   our revenues and assets for the year ended and as of august  would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not operate a hedging program to mitigate the effect of a significant change in the value of our foreign subsidiaries functional currencies  which include the canadian dollar  euro  british pound  mexican peso and nicaraguan cordova  as compared to the us dollar 
any gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions  including exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany accounts are reported as transaction gains losses in our other income expense 
the intercompany payables and receivables are denominated in canadian dollars  euros  british pounds  mexican pesos and nicaraguan cordova 
during the year ended august   transaction losses included in other income expense was approximately million 
if the exchange rates had changed by during the year ended august   we would have recognized exchange gains or losses of approximately million 
interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage these exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
as of august   we were exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowings under our credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and our floating rate notes which were purchased by a group of insurance companies pursuant to the note agreement 
we repaid all of the outstanding floating rate notes in september under both agreements  we borrow funds at variable interest rates based on the eurodollar rate or libor rates 
if the libor and eurodollar rates fluctuated by from the actual rates in effect during the year ended august   our interest expense would have fluctuated by approximately million from the interest expense recognized for the year ended august  in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and the related effect on our variable rate debt 
the swap agreement  with a notional amount of million  matured on march  we paid a fixed rate of and received a variable rate tied to the three month libor rate 
we accounted for this instrument as a cash flow hedge in accordance with us gaap and  as a result  recorded all changes in the fair value of the swap agreement in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity
