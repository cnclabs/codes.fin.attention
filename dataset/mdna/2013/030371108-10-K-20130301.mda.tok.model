amvac primarily sells its products on the basis of purchase orders  although it has entered into requirements contracts with certain customers 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data customers tenkoz  crop production services  inc formerly united agri products  western farm services and crop production services  and winfield solutions  llc accounted for   and respectively of the company s sales in    and in  and  and in distribution amvac distributes its products domestically predominantly through national distribution companies see customers above that purchase amvac s goods on a purchase order basis  and  in turn  sell them to retailers growers end users 
the company s domestic and international distributors typically have long established relationships with retailers end users  far reaching logistics and transportation capabilities  and customer service expertise 
the markets for amvac products vary by region  target crop  use and type of distribution channel 
amvac s distributors are expert at addressing these markets 
internationally  the company sells product either via its sales offices in the netherlands  mexico or cost rica  via employed sales force executives located in france  canada and venezuela  or via sales agents in other territories 
competition amvac faces competition from many domestic and foreign manufacturers in its marketplaces 
competition in amvac s marketplace is based primarily on quality  efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than amvac 
amvac s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products and expand its product lines and customer base 
amvac competes principally on the basis of the quality and efficacy of its products  price and the technical service and support given to its customers 
generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
in most cases  amvac has attempted to position itself in smaller niche markets which are no longer addressed by larger companies 
manufacturing through its four domestic manufacturing facilities see item  properties  amvac synthesizes many of the technical grade active ingredients that are in its end use products 
further  amvac formulates and packages the majority of its end use products at its own facilities or at the facilities of third party formulators 
raw materials amvac utilizes numerous companies  as well as internal sources  to supply the various raw materials and components used in manufacturing its products 
many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources 
in those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic  amvac seeks to secure its supply by either long term multi year arrangements or purchasing on long lead times from its suppliers 
amvac believes that it is considered to be a valued customer to such sole source suppliers 
intellectual property amvac s proprietary product formulations are protected  to the extent possible  as trade secrets and  to a lesser extent  by patents 
further  amvac s trademarks bring value to its products in both domestic and foreign markets 
although amvac considers that  in the aggregate  its trademarks  licenses  and patents constitute a valuable asset  it does not regard its business as being materially dependent upon any single trademark  license  or patent 
epa registrations amvac s products also receive protection afforded by the effect of the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act fifra legislation 
the legislation makes it unlawful to sell any pesticide in the united states  unless such pesticide has first been registered by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 
substantially all of amvac s products are subject to usepa registration and re registration requirements and are registered in accordance with fifra 
this registration by usepa is based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment  when it is used according to approved label directions 
all states  where any of amvac s products are used  require a registration by that specific state before it can be marketed or used in that state 
state registrations are renewed annually  as appropriate 
the 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data usepa and state agencies have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by amvac 
amvac  on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  has furnished  and is currently furnishing  certain required data relative to specific products 
under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as testing and the production of new products 
amvac expensed   and  during  and respectively  related to gathering this information 
see also part ii  item of this annual report on form k for discussions pertaining to research and development expenses 
environmental during  amvac continued activities to address environmental issues associated with its facility in commerce  ca 
the facility 
an outline of the history of those activities follows 
in  the california department of toxic substances control dtsc conducted a resource conservation and recovery act rcra facility assessment rfa of those facilities having hazardous waste storage permits 
in march  the rfa culminated in dtsc accepting the facility into its expedited remedial action program 
under this program  the facility was required to conduct an environmental investigation and health risk assessment 
depending on the findings of these investigations  the facility might also be required to develop and implement remedial measures to address any historical environmental impairment 
this activity then took two paths the rcra permit closure and the larger site characterization 
with respect to the permit closure  in  amvac began the formal process to close its hazardous waste permit at the facility which had allowed amvac to store hazardous waste longer than days as required by federal regulations 
formal regulatory closure actions began in and were completed in  as evidenced by dtsc s october  acknowledgement of amvac s closure certification report 
with respect to the site characterization  soil and groundwater characterization activities began in december in accordance with the site investigation plan that was approved by the dtsc 
additional activities were conducted from to  with oversight provided by the dtsc 
additional review of groundwater and soil data is being conducted in response to federally mandated initiatives of similarly affected sites 
risk assessment activities have concluded  and the company will prepare and submit a remedial action plan in until the remedial action plan has been submitted and comments are received from dtsc  it is uncertain whether the cost associated with further investigation and potential remediation activities will have a material impact on the company s financial statements or its results of operations 
thus  the company is unable to determine whether remediation is probable  nor can the cost of remediation be reasonably estimated the scope can vary depending upon the risk assessment and many other factors 
accordingly  the company has not set up a loss contingency with respect thereto 
amvac is subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety at the axis  al  commerce  ca  marsing  id  and hannibal  mo facilities 
amvac continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies 
the usepa and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have an impact on amvac s operations 
amvac expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with the governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment 
wherever feasible  amvac recovers raw materials and increases product yield in order to partially offset increasing pollution abatement costs 
the company is committed to a long term environmental protection program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment  as well as to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns 
employees as of december   the company employed employees 
from time to time  due to the seasonality of its business  amvac uses temporary contract personnel to perform certain duties primarily related to packaging of its products 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
the company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees

item a 
risk factors the regulatory climate has grown increasingly challenging to the company s interests both domestically and internationally various agencies within the us government continue to exercise increased scrutiny in permitting continued uses or the expansion of such uses of older chemistries  including many of the company s products and  in some cases  have initiated or entertained challenges to these uses 
the challenge of the regulatory climate is even more pronounced in certain other geographical regions  most especially the european union and brazil  where the company faces resistance to the continued use of certain of its products 
there is no guarantee that this climate will change in the near term  nor is there any guarantee that the company will be able to maintain or expand the uses of many of its products in the face of these regulatory challenges 
use of the company s products is subject to continuing challenges from activist groups use of agrochemical products  including the company s products is regularly challenged by activist groups in many jurisdictions under a multitude of federal and state statutes  including fifra  the food quality protection act  endangered species act  and the clean water act  to name a few 
these challenges typically take the form of lawsuits or administrative proceedings against the usepa and or other federal or state agencies  the filing of amicus briefs in pending actions  the introduction of legislation that is inimical to the company s interests  and or adverse comments made in response to public comment invited by usepa in the course of registration  re registration or label expansion 
it is possible that one or more of these challenges could succeed  resulting in a material adverse effect upon one or more of our products 
the distribution and sale of the company s products are subject to prior governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation the company s products are subject to laws administered by federal  state and foreign governments  including regulations requiring registration  approval and labeling of its products 
the labeling requirements restrict the use of and type of application for our products 
more stringent restrictions could make our products less available  which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
substantially all of the company s products are subject to the usepa registration and re registration requirements  and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
such registration requirements are based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of the company s products are used also require registration before they can be marketed or used in that state 
governmental regulatory authorities have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data the company s products 
the company  on its behalf and also in joint efforts with other registrants  has and is currently furnishing certain required data relative to its products 
there can be no assurance  however  that the usepa will not request that certain tests or studies be repeated or that more stringent legislation or requirements will not be imposed in the future 
the company can provide no assurance that any testing approvals or registrations will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or that its resources will be adequate to meet the costs of regulatory compliance 
the manufacturing of the company s products is subject to governmental regulations the company currently owns and operates three manufacturing facilities in los angeles  california  axis  alabama  and marsing  idaho and owns and has manufacturing services provided in a fourth facility in hannibal  missouri the facilities 
the facilities operate under the terms and conditions imposed by required licenses and permits by state and local authorities 
the manufacturing of key ingredients for certain of the company s products occurs at the facilities 
an inability to renew or maintain a license or permit or a significant increase in the fees for such licenses or permits could impede the company s manufacture of one or more of its products and or increase the cost of production  this  in turn  would materially and adversely affect the company s ability to provide its products in a timely and affordable manner 
the company faces competition in certain markets from manufacturers of genetically modified seeds the company faces competition from larger companies that market genetically modified gmo seeds in certain of the crop protection sectors in which the company competes  particularly that of corn 
many growers that have chosen to use gmo seeds have reduced their use of the types of pesticides sold by the company 
further  the federally mandated refuge acre requirement for corn which  in the name of preventing pest resistance  required growers using gmo seeds to set aside a percentage of their planting acres for non gmo seed  has been sharply reduced 
there is no guarantee that the company will maintain its market share or pricing levels in sectors that are subject to competition from gmo seed marketers or that federal mandates to set aside acreage for non gmo seed will continue 
the company is dependent upon certain sole source suppliers for certain of its active ingredients in conjunction with the purchase and or licensing of various product lines including mocap  nemacur  impact and force  the company has been required by sellers licensors to enter into multi year supply arrangements under which such counterparties are the sole source of either active ingredients and or formulated end use product 
in some cases  the manufacturer has been unable to deliver the volume of product necessary to meet the company s demand 
further  certain manufacturers have expressed a desire to discontinue production of such goods earlier than anticipated 
in one case  the manufacturer has entered the market as a competitor 
there is no guarantee that these sole source manufacturers will be willing or able to supply these products to the company reliably  continuously and at the levels anticipated by the company or required by the market 
in addition  while the company is making efforts to transfer production of certain of these products to its own facilities  there is no guarantee that these initiatives will be successful or that they will be completed in a timely fashion so as to permit the company to meet market demand in the short to mid term 
if these sources prove to be unreliable and the company is not able to supplant or otherwise second source these manufacturers  it is possible that the company will not realize its projected sales  which  in turn  could adversely affect the company s results of operation 
the company may be subject to environmental liabilities while the company expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials into the environment and to comply with governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment and its workforce  federal and state authorities may nevertheless seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations 
further  these various governmental agencies could  among other things  impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from the release of pesticides and other agents into the environment 
in addition  while the company continually adapts its manufacturing processes to the environmental control standards of regulatory authorities  it cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials 
in the event of such contamination or injury  the company may be held liable for significant damages or fines 
in the event that such damages or fines are assessed  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation 
the company s business may be adversely affected by cyclical and seasonal effects demand for the company s products tends to be seasonal 
seasonal usage follows varying agricultural seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
weather patterns can have an impact on the company s operations 
for example  the end user of its products may  because of weather patterns  delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season  which may result in a reduction of the use of some products and therefore may reduce the company s revenues and profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will adequately address any adverse seasonal effects 
the company faces competition from generic competitors that source product from countries having lower cost structures the company continues to face competition from competitors that may enter the market through making offers to pay data compensation and then subsequently may source material from countries having lower cost structures 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data typically india and china 
these competitors typically tend to operate at thinner gross margins and  with low costs of goods  can drive pricing and profitability of subject product lines downward 
further  such competitors typically spend little on product stewardship and employ few personnel within the united states 
in effect  they may attempt to commoditize all products which they distribute  that is  they operate by offering the lowest price goods 
there is no guarantee that the company will maintain market share over generic competitors or that such competitors will not offer generic versions of the company s products in the future 
the company s key customers typically carry competing product lines and may be influenced by the company s larger competitors a significant portion of the company s products are sold to national distributors in the united states  who also carry product lines of competitors that are much larger than the company 
typically  revenues from the sales of these competing product lines and related program incentives constitute a greater part of our distributors income than do revenues from sales and program incentives arising from the company s product lines 
further  these distributors are often under pressure to market competing product lines in favor of the company s 
in light of these facts  there is no assurance that such customers will continue to market our products aggressively or successfully or that the company will be able to influence such customers to continue to purchase our products instead of those of our competitors 
to the extent that capacity utilization is not fully realized at its manufacturing facilities  the company may experience lower profitability the company has pursued a business strategy of acquiring manufacturing facilities at a steep discount to their replacement value 
these acquisitions have enabled the company to be more independent of overseas manufacturers than some of our competitors 
while the company endeavors continuously to maximize utilization of these several facilities  our success in these endeavors is dependent upon many factors beyond our control  including fluctuating market conditions  product life cycles  weather conditions  availability of raw materials and regulatory constraints  among other things 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maximize its utilization of capacity at its manufacturing facilities 
to the extent that the company experiences excess manufacturing capacity  it may experience lower profitability 
reduced availability and higher prices of raw materials may reduce the company s profitability and could threaten the viability of some of its products in the recent past  there has been a material reduction in the number of suppliers of certain important raw materials used by the company in many of its products 
certain of these raw materials are available solely from sources overseas or from single sources domestically 
in the recent past  the price of these raw materials has fluctuated sharply 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to source some or all of these materials indefinitely or that it will be able to do so at a level of cost that will enable it to maintain its profit margin on its products 
foreign currency and interest rate risk and the use of derivative instruments and hedging activities the company engages in global business transactions 
where possible  the company does business in its functional currency 
however  there are certain situations in which the company is unable to transact in its functional currency and engages in agreements that require settlement in a different currency 
the company may enter into derivative instruments to manage foreign currency risk of these agreements  in other words  it may  from time to time establish a forward exchange rate at the point of placing a purchase order and thereby insure the company against movement in the exchange rate 
in addition  the company may use interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate expense generated by variable rate debt 
the company has in place one fixed interest rate swap with the objective of reducing the company s exposure to movements in the libor rate over time 
this is required as a condition of the company s senior credit facilities agreement 
dependence on the company s banking relationship the company s main bank is bank of the west  a wholly owned subsidiary of the french bank  bnp paribas 
bank of the west has been the company s primary bank for more than years 
bank of the west is the syndication manager for the company s loans and acts as the counterparty on the company s derivative transactions 
the company reviews the creditworthiness of its banks on a quarterly basis via credit agencies and also has face to face meetings with senior management of the banks 
management believes that the company has an excellent working relationship with bank of the west and the other financial institutions in the company s lender group 
in light of the uncertainties in global financial markets  there is no guarantee  however  that the company s lenders will be either willing or able to continue lending to the company at such rates and in such amounts as may be necessary to meet the company s working capital needs 
the company is dependent on a limited number of customers  which makes it vulnerable to the continued relationship with and financial health of those customers in  three customers accounted for of the company s sales 
the company s future prospects will depend on the continued business of such customers and on our continued status as a qualified supplier to such customers 
the company cannot guarantee that our current significant customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels 
the loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operation

the usepa suspended registrations of dbcp in october  except for use on pineapples in hawaii 
the usepa suspension was partially based on studies by other manufacturers that indicated a possible link between male fertility and exposure to dbcp among their factory production workers involved with producing the product 
at present  there are approximately lawsuits  foreign and domestic  filed by former banana workers in which amvac has been named as a party 
fifteen of these suits have been filed in the united states with prayers for unspecified damages and the remainder have been filed in nicaragua 
three of these domestic suits were brought by citizens of nicaragua  while the other domestic suits have been brought by citizens of other countries 
these claims are all in various stages and allege injury from exposure to dbcp  including claims for sterility 
only two of the suits suazo and castillo  indicated below filed in nicaragua have been served on amvac 
it should be noted that nicaraguan plaintiffs had not been able to obtain domestic enforcement of decisions rendered by nicaraguan courts 
the eleventh circuit recently upheld a us district court s refusal to enforce a  nicaraguan judgment rendered against certain us based dbcp defendants finding  among other things  lack of international due process 
as described more fully below  activity in domestic cases during is as follows in hawaii  patrickson  et 
al 
v 
dole food company  et 
al which had been dismissed in  remains on appeal  and adams  from which co defendant dole was dismissed  is on appeal with respect to such dismissal and  at any rate  involves claims that pre dated amvac s sales into the relevant market 
in louisiana and delaware  there has been much overlapping activity 
three actions filed in louisiana state court soriano et al in november have been dismissed due to expiration of the statute of limitations  similarly  seven cases filed by hendlerlaw  pc in pc district court for the eastern district of louisiana aguilar et al have been dismissed for the same reason no appeal has yet been taken in either venue 
in delaware  the blanco case involving a single costa rican claimant has survived defendants motion to dismiss for expiration of the statute of limitations  the lower court finding that such statute was extended under the doctrine of cross jurisdictional tolling 
however  the delaware supreme court has accepted an appeal of this decision 
also  in delaware  hendlerlaw  pc filed nine matters during  eight with the pc district court for the district of delaware and one before the delaware state court chaverri 
six of the federal matters were identical to claims then pending before the louisiana courts and  upon defendants motion  were dismissed by the delaware federal court 
two of the eight delaware cases abad castillo and marquinez involving claims brought on behalf of  plantation workers from costa rica  ecuador  guatemala and panama remain pending and are the subject of motions to dismiss 
delaware matters on or about july   an action encaptioned  blanco v 
amvac chemical corporation et al  was filed with the superior court of the state of delaware in and for new castle county no 
nc joh on behalf of an individual plaintiff  residing in costa rica  against several defendants  including  among others  amvac  the dow chemical 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data company  occidental chemical corporation  and dole food company 
in the action  plaintiff claims personal injury sterility arising from the alleged exposure to dbcp between and while working as a contract laborer in a banana plantation in costa rica 
defendant dow filed a motion to dismiss the action as being barred under the applicable statute of limitations  as this same plaintiff filed the same claim in florida in and subsequently withdrew the matter 
plaintiff contends that the statute of limitations was tolled by a prior motion for class certification  which was denied 
amvac contends that the plaintiff could not have been exposed to any dbcp supplied by amvac in costa rica 
on august   the court denied dow s motion to dismiss based upon applicable statutes of limitation 
in response to that denial  on august   defendants filed a motion for interlocutory appeal and  on september   the delaware supreme court granted interlocutory appeal on the question of whether the state of delaware will recognize cross jurisdictional tolling that is  whether it is proper for a delaware court to follow the class action tolling of another jurisdiction  in this case  texas  rather than its own two year statute of limitations 
pending the ruling on appeal  the blanco matter is stayed 
it is expected that the delaware supreme court will issue its ruling in whatever the outcome on appeal  amvac intends to defend the matter vigorously 
the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency for the matter 
on or about may  the day on which the trial court in blanco denied defendants motion to dismiss  hendlerlaw  pc  which represents plaintiffs in seven related matters that had been pending before the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana the hendler louisiana cases referred to in the company s form k for the period ended december  as aguilar et al  v 
dole fruit company  inc  et al usdc  usdc of la no 
cv cjb ss  filed nine separate actions  eight with the united states district court for the district of delaware the hendler delaware cases uscd de no 
cv rga and one with the superior court of the state of delaware which  for purposes of this filing shall be referred to as chaverri et al 
v 
dole food company  inc et al  case no 
nc joh 
amvac received these complaints by mail on or about july  six of the eight hendler delaware cases and chaverri involve claims for personal injury allegedly arising from exposure to dbcp on behalf of banana workers from costa rica  ecuador and panama 
dole subsequently brought a motion to dismiss these seven matters under the first to file theory of jurisdiction  specifically in light of the fact that they involved identical claims and claimants as those appearing in the hendler louisiana cases 
on august   the us district court in the hendler delaware cases granted defendants motion to dismiss six complaints filed on behalf of plaintiffs finding that the same claimants and claims were pending in the hendler louisiana cases where they had been first filed 
in october  the federal district court in louisiana granted defendant s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the hendler louisiana cases for plaintiffs failure to bring the action within the applicable statute of limitations 
further  with the stay of proceedings in blanco  the chaverri action has also been stayed  pending a ruling from the delaware supreme court as previously described 
with respect to the subject matter of chaverri  at this stage of the proceedings  the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency 
two of the eight hendler delaware cases namely  abad castillo and marquinez are unrelated to the hendler louisiana cases and  involve claims for physical injury arising from alleged exposure to dbcp over the course of the late s through the mid s on behalf of  banana plantation workers from costa rica  ecuador  guatemala and panama 
defendants are investigating possible defenses to abad castillo and marquinez  including whether any of the claimants had appeared in prior actions that may have been settled or dismissed  what statutes of limitations may apply  and whether claimants used any of defendants products 
amvac intends to defend these matters vigorously 
defendant dole has brought a motion to dismiss plaintiffs from the abad castillo case on the ground that they were parties in the hendler louisiana cases 
in september  plaintiffs responded to the motion to dismiss  arguing that  in fact  while of the claimants were parties in the hendler louisiana cases  eight of them were not 
with respect to the marquinez matter  the company has filed an answer to the complaint 
no discovery has commenced in either of these matters and it is too early to predict whether a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable  accordingly  the company has not set up a loss contingency on either of these matters 
hawaiian matters patrickson  et

v 
dole food company  et

other named defendants include dole food company  shell oil company and dow chemical company 
the ten named plaintiffs are variously citizens of four countries guatemala  costa rica  panama  and ecuador 
punitive damages are sought against each defendant 
the case was also filed as a class action on behalf of other workers allegedly so exposed in these four countries 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data after several years of law and motion activity  dow filed a motion for summary adjudication as to the remaining plaintiffs based on the statute of limitations  as they had filed suit in florida in all defendants joined in this motion 
the court granted this motion on june  plaintiffs counsel unsuccessfully argued that their claims were tolled by prior class action cases 
on november   the court denied a motion for reconsideration 
judgment in favor of the defendants was entered on july  on august   the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal  which is presently pending 
in march  dow filed a brief in opposition to the appeal  arguing that plaintiffs are barred from this action by the applicable statute of limitations 
following the completion of briefing on april   counsel for plaintiffs filed a pleading to withdraw and to substitute new counsel 
the court has not ruled on any of the pending motions  nor do the court rules require that the court rule by any particular date 
the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and  accordingly  has not set up a loss contingency for this matter 
adams v 
dole food company et al on approximately november   amvac was served with a suit filed by two former hawaiian pineapple workers and their spouses  alleging that they had testicular cancer due to dbcp exposure adams v 
dole food company et al in the first circuit for the state of hawaii 
the complaint was filed on june  and names dole food company  standard fruit and steamship company  dole fresh food  pineapple growers association  amvac  shell oil company  dow chemical company and occidental chemical corporation 
plaintiff mark adams alleges he was exposed to dbcp in and while working on dole s plantation on oahu 
plaintiff nelson ng alleges he was exposed between and while working in lanai city  lanai 
amvac answered the complaint on or about december  while little discovery has taken place  amvac denies that any of its product could have been used at the times and locations alleged by these plaintiffs 
dole food company was dismissed on the basis of the exclusive remedy of worker s compensation benefits  as it was the employer of plaintiffs 
however  plaintiffs have been granted relief to seek an interim appeal as to the dismissal of dole  which appeal is pending 
a stay has been placed on discovery other than to obtain written records 
recent pleadings included a request for withdrawal of plaintiffs counsel and substitution of new counsel 
the substitution was denied by the court on november  there is no estimated date of opinion 
the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency for this matter 
louisiana matters federal on june   seven separate actions were filed by hendlerlaw  pc in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana on behalf of individual plaintiffs banana plantation workers from ecuador  panama and costa rica against dole food company  the dow chemical company  shell oil company  and amvac chemical corporation to name a few which  for purposes of convenience here  are encaptioned aguilar et al  v

these matters allege personal injury including sterility  cancer  skin disorders and other conditions arising from alleged exposure to dbcp within the time period from through or later 
a number of the plaintiffs appear to have been drawn from earlier dbcp litigation matters filed by hendlerlaw  pc  including  for example  the mendez case that was dismissed from state court in hawaii see the company s form q for the period ended march  
in september  the court granted defendants motion for summary judgment based upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 
no appeal has been filed 
the company will defend any appeal vigorously 
with respect to these matters  the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency for these matters 
louisiana matters state in november  amvac was served with three complaints filed in the th judicial district court for the parish of st 
charles  state of louisiana  we have reported on these matters under the name of the lead case  eduardo soriano  et al 
v 
amvac  et al 
these matters allege personal injuries to about persons approximately from ecuador  from costa rica  and from guatemala from alleged exposure to dbcp 
with the united states supreme court holding there was no federal court jurisdiction in the patrickson case  the federal court judge remanded the cases to louisiana state court in june in state court  the three cases were assigned to two different judges 
on november   the state court separated the cases handled by hendlerlaw  pc from the cases being pursued only against the growers handled by different counsel 
subsequently  the cases against the growers were settled and all those actions were dismissed 
the cases handled by hendlerlaw  pc were supposed to be placed in a new action  which was not done 
after a hearing on january   the court ruled on february  that these plaintiffs could still proceed in the existing cases rather than in a new action 
in mid june  some years after filing the actions  plaintiffs have propounded written discovery against defendants 
in 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data november  the court granted defendants motion for summary judgment as to all of these cases on the ground that the applicable statute of limitations had expired

amvac intends to defend any appeal vigorously 
with respect to these matters  the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency for this matter 
nicaraguan matters in may  two suits filed in nicaragua in were received that name amvac  the dow chemical company  dole food company  dole fresh fruit  and standard fruit company 
the two suits for personal injuries for sterility and reduced sperm counts have been filed on behalf of a total of banana workers flavio apolinar castillo et al 
v 
amvac chemical corporation et al  no 
and luis cristobal martinez suazo et al 
v 
amvac chemical corporation et al  no 
in december  amvac received six additional  similar  lawsuits filed on behalf of a total of plaintiffs 
on january   amvac was served with the suazo and castillo suits  and in march  counsel in nicaragua filed objections to jurisdiction over amvac in these two cases 
the court finally ruled on all the defendants objections on march   by denying each objection to jurisdiction  this ruling has been appealed 
a review of court filings in chinandega  nicaragua  by local counsel has found suits filed pursuant to public law that name amvac and include approximately  plaintiffs 
however  only two cases  castillo and suazo  have been served on amvac 
all but one of the suits in nicaragua have been filed pursuant to special law  an october nicaraguan statute that contains substantive and procedural provisions that nicaragua s attorney general previously expressed as unconstitutional 
each of the nicaraguan plaintiffs claims  in compensatory damages and  in punitive damages 
in all of these cases  amvac is a joint defendant with dow chemical company and dole food company  inc amvac contends that the nicaragua courts do not have jurisdiction over it and that public law violates international due process of law 
amvac intends to contest personal jurisdiction and demand under law that the claims be litigated in the united states 
thus far  it appears that the nicaraguan courts have denied all requests of other defendants under law that allow the defendants the option of consenting to jurisdiction in the united states 
it is not presently known as to how many of these plaintiffs actually claim exposure to dbcp at the time amvac s product was allegedly used nor is there any verification of the claimed injuries 
based on the precedent of the earlier suits in nicaragua  it would appear likely that the nicaragua courts will  over the defendants objections  enter multi million dollar judgments for the plaintiffs and against all defendants in these cases 
however  to date  plaintiffs have not had success in enforcing nicaraguan judgments against domestic companies before us courts 
one such judgment not including the company was entered in august for  for plaintiffs against dole food and other entities 
it has also been reported that on december   the nicaraguan court rendered a judgment for  against dow chemical company  shell oil company  occidental chemical corporation  and standard fruit company for some  plaintiffs 
an enforcement action entitled osorio against dole and dow for the  judgment was filed in the us district court in miami  florida 
in this enforcement action  on october   the federal court issued a lengthy decision refusing to enforce the judgment on the grounds that law violated due process of law and that the nicaraguan courts were not impartial tribunals 
the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the eleventh circuit court of appeal on march  on march   the united states court of appeals for the th circuit upheld the lower court s decision to refuse to enforce the nicaraguan judgment under the florida recognition act  finding  among other things  the fact that judgment had been rendered under a system in nicaragua that does not provide procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law and was contrary to public policy 
the th circuit court did not address whether the nicaraguan courts do not provide impartial tribunals as the district court had found 
with respect to these nicaraguan matters  amvac intends to defend any claim vigorously 
furthermore  the company does not believe that a loss is either probable or reasonably estimable and has not set up a loss contingency for these matters

other matters brazilian citation 
on or about october   ibama the brazilian equivalent of the usepa served amvac brazil with a notice of violation alleging that two lots of granutox formulated product having phorate as the active ingredient stored at basf sa amvac s exclusive distributor in brazil and fmc quimica do brasil ltda 
which formulates end use product in that country were not in compliance with the end use registration on file with ibama 
specifically  ibama alleged that the color of the lots gray was inconsistent with the description in ibama s files pink 
ibama also indicated an intention to assess a fine of approximately against amvac b 
the company has challenged the citation  for among other reasons  on the ground that the change in color has to do with the removal of a coloring component and that such removal poses no environmental or toxicity risk 
in march  ibama denied amvac b s first appeal 
the company believes  however  that the agency is statutorily prevented from levying a fine of this magnitude for an infraction of this nature 
thus  the company has filed another appeal on these grounds and expects to hear a response during at this stage  the company believes that a loss of between and is probable and has set up a loss contingency in the amount of

as a result  growers invested more heavily in yield enhancing inputs which fueled demand for many of the company s most important crop protection products 
this was particularly true in corn  where strong demand and a rising crop commodity price led to increased planted acreage in the united states 
in  a record million acres of corn were planted  over million acres were harvested  and yield per acre was depressed to approximately bushels from an average yield of closer to bushels in prior years 
the drop in yield arose from a persistent drought in parts of the midwest and southwest 
this extreme mid season and late season drought did not affect the use of the company s important granular soil insecticides since these products are applied at the time of planting 
the drought of also affected us cotton growers and destroyed nearly of planted acreage  mostly in texas 
however  in other southern and southeastern states weather conditions were somewhat more favorable  allowing amvac to achieve excellent sales of its cotton insecticides and harvest defoliants 
adding to the challenges of meeting excess demand and coping with problematic weather  the continuing practice of planting corn on the same acres year after year versus sequential rotation of corn and soybeans has intensified primary secondary insect pest pressure in the midwest united states 
furthermore  over the past few seasons  growers particularly of corn have increasingly adopted the use of conventional chemistry as an important part of integrated pest management  both to control resistant pests and to help improve yield 
additionally  with the widespread use of glyphosate herbicides over the last years  many growers are having to cope with hard to control weeds grasses through other means  including complementary herbicides 
as a result  the company has experienced increased demand for its soil insecticides and post emergent herbicide products for corn

within this segment  annual net sales of our granular soil insecticides were up more than over  driven by a strong performance from our primary corn soil insecticides aztec  smartchoice  counter and force 
our mocap and nemacur granular insecticides nematicides benefited from an average selling price increase and remained relatively flat on volume with improved supply of mocap  offsetting some volume shortfall on nemacur 
annual net sales of thimet grew by nearly over the prior year including approximately related to price  primarily on peanut acres  in sugar cane fields and as a preferred substitute for a withdrawn competitive insecticide aldicarb 
among our non granular insecticide products  net sales for crop applications grew by led by our foliar cotton insecticide bidrin 
sales of bifenthrin  permethrin and acephate remained flat with the prior year  as we continued to de emphasize the applications of these products that have become susceptible to low priced generic competition 
within the product group of herbicides fungicides fumigants  our crop net sales in were down about to  vs 
 in within this group  we had mixed results 
net sales of our herbicide products were down  resulting from the timing of sales and supply availability for our post emergent corn herbicide  impact 
actual on the ground use of impact increased in despite supply limitations and the effects of the severe midwest summer drought 
our fumigants sales volume increased approximately as our vapam and k pam products continue to be domestic market leaders in this product category 
net sales of our fungicides were up in  as we continue to recapture market share in potatoes with our pcnb product range 
there were no price increases on pcnb 
within the crop segment of other products group which includes plant growth regulators  molluscicides and third party manufacturing activity  we experienced an increase of in net sales during   vs 
 in we had record sales performance for folex  a defoliant used in cotton harvest management 
this included slightly lower overall volumes in line with cotton acres harvested but increased pricing as the market recognized the benefits of this brand 
naa  our leading plant growth regulator  primarily used in apples to stop apple drop  the return of bloom and later in the season for thinning blossom  had a significant gain of 
net sales of metaldehyde  a molluscicide were up over the comparable period  and third party manufacturing revenues decreased by approximately in as compared to within our non crop segment  net sales were up over to  vs 
 compared to naled sales our dibrom brand mosquito adulticide were up by including average selling price increase  with moderate storm and hurricane activity and despite continued drought conditions in portions of the southeast 
net sales of pest strips increased in volume and approximately in selling price as compared to the prior year  as professional pest control operators continue to recognize that these products are among the most effective residual pest deterrents in commercial applications 
additionally  net sales of our pcnb fungicide for turf uses tripled  as we continue to recover market share following our reentry to the market 
the company has yet to re enter the canadian market following the expiration of its registration at the end of we are also pleased to report that initial sales from envance our new joint venture with tyratech were recorded in the weeks leading up to december  the business sells very effective organic aerosol products through home depot stores

our cost of sales for was  or of net sales 
this compared to  or of net sales for the decline in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in arose primarily from these factors 
in the company continued to focus on selling those products having higher margins or lower costs 
this included a further drop in manufacturing activities for third parties as increased demand for plant capacity generated less incentive to drive this aspect of the business 
typically  such activities enable us to cover costs but do not generate much  if any  gross profit 
furthermore  our sales in have been focused on our strongest brands that are targeted at specific problems that have been impacting agriculture in the year and products that tend to have strong margin performance throughout the supply chain 
as detailed in

general and administrative expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of the main reasons for the increased costs are  first  stock based and incentive compensation as a result of our improved overall financial performance  second  legal and consulting costs related to product defense  creation of our new international structure and creation of our new majority owned subsidiary  third  additional headcount supporting our expanding business 
research  product development costs and regulatory expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of this is mainly due to product defense and development cost in support of our expanding business plus key product development and research headcount

during the year we operated the business without accessing our revolving debt facility by continued focus on inventory  receivables and program management 
as can be seen from the above table  on a gross basis  our effective interest rate increased to as compared to last year 
the increase is caused by the fixed interest rate swap  which is required as part of the company s credit agreement 
after deductions of capitalized interest and including expenses related to the amortization of deferred liabilities  our effective rate was for as compared to in this is a reduction in comparison to the prior year primarily as a result of lower amortization of discounting on deferred liabilities related to product line acquisitions

this revision had no impact on previously reported amounts for stockholders equity  gross margin  net income  earnings per share or cash flows from operations 
the company concluded that this revision was not material to previously issued financial statements 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we believe that the combination of our cash flows from operations  current cash on hand and the availability under the company s credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next months 
although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent of significant growth in the future  our operating and investing activities will use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to access some or all of the availability under the credit facilities 
it is also possible  that additional sources of finance may be necessary to support additional growth 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt note payable on product acquisitions and asset purchases sub total long term debt estimated interest liability accrued royalty obligations deferred earn outs on product acquisitions employment agreements operating leases rental properties operating leases vehicles the interest related to notes payable on product acquisitions and asset purchases is the amortization of the discounting on the deferred liabilities related to product acquisitions that occurred in december under the terms of the credit facility  the deferred payment on product acquisitions made in december and payable in january  may be paid using the delayed draw facility within the term debt estimated interest liability has been calculated using the effective rate for each category of debt over the remaining term of the debt and taking into account scheduled repayments 
the working capital revolving line has been assumed to be constant ie zero throughout the remaining term 
as noted above in this report  all of our debt is linked to libor rates 
there were no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  under the terms of the credit facility  all debt outstanding is due when the agreement expires on january  in addition to the above contractual obligations  of unrecognized tax liabilities have been recorded as liabilities as of december  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table above  we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of as of december

in light of these market conditions  growers invested more heavily in yield enhancing inputs which fueled demand for many of the company s most important crop protection products 
rising crop commodity prices also led to an increase in acreage planted for many crops in the united states  particularly corn and cotton  which are important to our business 
in  a near record  acre of corn were planted and cotton acreage expanded to  acres from  acres one year ago and just  acres two years ago 
in addition  the practice of planting corn on the same acres year after year referred to as corn on corn as opposed to rotating crops gave rise to greater primary secondary insect pest pressure in the midwest united states 
further  years of continuous application of glyphosate herbicides has led to resistant weeds grasses and increased the need for complementary auxiliary herbicide use 
also  the wide spread use of genetically modified seeds plants in us corn during the last decade has engendered resistance among some soil insects that had been controlled by genetic plant defenses 
the cumulative effect of all these factors led to increased demand for the type of crop protection products for corn that the company supplies 
overall financial performance including net sales and net income for the year ended december  improved as compared to the same period in our net sales for the period were up approximately to  as compared to  for the year ended december  net sales of our crop business in were  which constitutes an increase of about over the net sales of  in net sales of non crop products for the period were  which constitutes an increase of about over the net sales of  in the same period last year 
a more detailed discussion of product groups and products having a material effect on net sales for each of the crop and non crop segments appears below 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data further  the company s sales benefited from the acquisition of several new products acquired in the second half of the addition of the insecticides aztec  mocap and nemacur accounted for approximately half of the company s  year over year gain in crop sales 
we also benefitted from the withdrawal of a competitive insecticide product in the us market  which yielded improved sales of our granular insecticide thimet 
with respect to our crop segment  net sales of our insecticides in were up strongly to  representing an increase of approximately as compared to  for the comparable period in within this segment  annual net sales of our granular soil insecticides were up approximately over the same period  driven by a strong performance from our primary corn soil insecticides aztec  smartchoice  counter and force 
this product group also benefitted from the newly acquired mocap and nemacur granular insecticides nematicides which were purchased in december despite the fact that we experienced a shortfall in supply of mocap during from our source 
annual net sales of thimet grew by more than one half over the prior year due to increased peanut acres  increased use for nematode control in sugar cane and the above mentioned substitution for a withdrawn competitive insecticide aldicarb 
among our non granular insecticide products  overall net sales declined by nearly 
our foliar cotton insecticide  bidrin  decreased compared to the prior year due to severe drought conditions in the southern region 
further  sales of bifenthrin  permethrin and orthene declined approximately as we de emphasize the applications of these products that have become susceptible to low priced generic competition  however  despite the drop in net sales  we experienced improved overall levels of gross profit from these three products 
offsetting these declines  sales of our dibrom insecticide  which has historically been used primarily for mosquito control  continued to expand in crop citrus applications 
within the product group of herbicides fungicides fumigants  net sales in were up about over the year  vs 

within this group we had mixed results 
net sales of our herbicide products were up  led by our post emergent corn herbicide  impact  which midwest farmers use as a highly effective product to combat the increasing challenge of glyphosate tolerant weeds 
our fumigants sales were up modestly as our vapam and k pam products continue to be us market leaders in this product category 
net sales of our fungicides  however  were down during as compared to  this was due to the fact that all domestic sales of pcnb were suspended following the issuance of a ssuro in august  partially offset by the issuance of new labels in november within the segment of other products which includes plant growth regulators  molluscicides and third party manufacturing activity  we experienced a nearly increase in net sales during as compared to  vs 

this increase is primarily due to strong sales of folex  a defoliant used in cotton harvest management  while certain cotton regions experienced severe drought conditions  in other areas  cooler than normal conditions caused the growers to use the product at higher use rates 
net sales of folex were also positively impacted by our acquisition of the domestic def tribufos product line in late july partially offsetting folex s gains was a slight drop in net sales of naa  a plant growth regulator primarily used in apples to stop apple drop  the return of bloom  and for thinning blossom 
net sales of metaldehyde a molluscicide were approximately flat over the comparable period  and third party manufacturing revenues decreased by approximately  in as compared to finally  it should be noted that  included in sales in was data compensation in the amount of there was no similar revenue recorded in within our non crop segment  net sales were up by about  v 
 compared to on the positive side  naled sales were up despite limited hurricane activity and persistent drought conditions in the southwest  early season river flooding caused greater pest pressure and spraying activity 
in the same segment  net sales of pest strips increased over the prior year as professional pest control operators continue to recognize that our active ingredient  ddvp  is one of the most effective general pest control agents available today 
offsetting these gains was a decline in net sales of our pcnb fungicide for turf uses 
as mentioned above  all domestic sales had been suspended through late november  when usepa issued new labels 
consequently  the company missed most of the turf season 
in addition  the company has yet to re enter the canadian market following the expiration of its registration at the end of our cost of sales for was  or of net sales 
this compared to  or of net sales for the decline in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in arose primarily from these factors 
in the company focused on selling those products having higher margins or lower costs 
at the same time  we de emphasized sales of those products that are subject to pricing pressure from generic competition eg  acephate  bifenthrin and permethrin which products typically have a high cost of sales as compared to the market selling price 
further  with increased demand for plant capacity relating to the production of our own products  we allowed a drop in manufacturing activity for third parties 
typically  such activities enable us to cover costs but do not generate much  if any  gross profit 
as detailed in the above table  the change in volume  mix  price and manufacturing activity resulted overall in a improvement in gross margin to in as compared to for the same period of the prior year 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data the financial statements have been revised to appropriately reflect the correct application of generally accepted accounting principles 
net sales and cost of sales for the year ended december  have each been decreased by  to appropriately reverse an improper gross up 
this revision had no impact on previously reported amounts for stockholders equity  gross margin  net income  earnings per share or cash flows from operations 
the company concluded that this revision was not material to previously issued financial statements 
operating expenses in increased by  to  or of sales as compared to  or in the differences in operating expenses by department are as follows change selling general and administrative research  product development and regulatory freight  delivery and warehousing selling expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of the main driver for increased overall cost was from expenses in support of our proprietary delivery system and other stewardship activities  wages  and travel expenses to support our expanded business 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to end at  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of the four main drivers of this increase were an increase in amortization expense that resulted from the acquisitions made in december  an increase in stock based compensation expense relating to grants issued in december  and an increase in incentive compensation expense from the increase in overall financial performance 
offsetting these increases  the company re assessed the fair value of certain discounted deferred liabilities related to product line acquisition 
research  product development costs and regulatory expenses increased by  to  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period of this is mainly due to increased studies on our new and existing products including spending related to the pcnb ssuro 
freight  delivery and warehousing costs for the year ended december  were  or of sales as compared to  or of sales for the same period in total interest expense was  in  as compared to  in interest costs are summarized in the following table average indebtedness and interest expense average debt interest expense interest rate average debt interest expense interest rate term loan real estate working capital revolver average notes payable on product acquisitions and asset purchases interest income capitalized interest amortization of deferred loan fees amortization of other deferred liabilities other interest expense total the company s average overall debt for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the comparable period of the previous year 
early in the year we paid the revolving credit facility down to zero and did not draw further funds as a result of continued focus on inventory  receivables and program management 
as can be seen from the table above  on a gross basis  our effective interest rate was as compared to in the reduction was as a result of the new credit agreement that was signed on january  after deduction of capitalized interest and including expenses relating to amortization of deferred liabilities  our effective interest rate was as compared to in this is effectively flat in comparison to the prior year 
it should also be noted that the company paid out substantially all its program liabilities for the crop year ended september  during the final quarter of the year 
in the prior year approximately of program liabilities were paid in the three months ended december  
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data income tax expense for amounted to  as compared to  for the effective tax rate is at  as compared to an effective rate of for the increase in effective tax rate is primarily due to lower tax benefits from federal and california r d due to substantially higher pre tax book income in as compared to  lower than expected domestic production activities deduction claimed in the federal income tax return  and the benefit related to stock options in net income ended at  or

net income of  non cash depreciation  amortization of intangibles  other assets and discounted future liabilities of   in the prior year plus stock based compensation of  provided a net cash inflow of  as compared to  for the same period of as of december   our working capital has increased to  as compared to  as of december  this increase was mainly driven by slightly elevated inventory levels as we build in preparation for the start of the new growing season  slightly higher receivable levels following a very strong final quarter 
these pressures were substantially offset by increased levels of programs and deferred revenues 
inventories ended the year at  up  as compared to the same period of the prior year 
this is a reflection of strong indications from the field about early season demand that will go out to the market in the first and second quarters of inventory also increased as a result of receipts into inventory of the company s leading herbicide  impact  which arrived close to year end 
it should also be noted that the company purchases and holds raw material  intermediate or finished goods inventory from time to time based on a single annual purchase from a single source or supplier  potentially resulting in peaks in the carrying value of raw materials 
furthermore  in order to achieve efficient manufacturing runs  the company may manufacture one time per year of a particular product and then carry high levels of that inventory for a period 
finally  it is a feature of the industry that inventory is carried in anticipation of demand from the market as a result of specific pest pressure or weather conditions  on time schedules that could not accommodate either a purchasing or manufacturing process 
our program accruals have ended higher than at the end of the prior year despite having paid out of our crop liabilities that were due and payable in the last month of the year 
this increase reflects primarily the activity level in the final quarter of the year 
as a result  accrued program costs are up  at december   as compared to december  a significant factor in our cash performance in has been the need to respond to market demand for products sold exclusively in our proprietary delivery systems including smartbox 
demand has increased to such a degree that in  we made the decision to increase our inventory of long lived packaging supplies 
these are treated as other assets and amortized over expected lives of between and years 
these items increased by  during the last two quarters of additionally  we have increased supply levels of our patented computerized control systems that support farmer s demand to improve the intelligence applied to delivering our products exactly in the right areas of the field and at the right application levels 
the complex computer controllers are built in the fall and sold to growers in the spring 
we concluded an agreement with tyratech on november  which involved the purchased of a year license to access their patented technology 
the cost of this license is included as an other asset  rather than an intangible asset  because it is not an owned asset 
the company used  in investing activities in the twelve months to december  as compared to  in the same period of this year we have spent  on fixed assets primarily focused on continuing to invest in manufacturing infrastructure in support of our growing sales  and  on intangible assets  involving the purchase of a year license for access to certain patented technology 
our financing activities utilized net cash of  in as compared to providing  in the main uses were to make scheduled term loan amortization payments and to pay scheduled deferred payments related to product acquisitions in december  the company increased its deferred liabilities primarily due to the tyratech license

this agreement is also the driver for the non controlling interest which reflects tyratech s ownership 
the company received  from the exercise of stock options and the sales of common stock under its espp plan as compared to for the same period of last year 
finally  the company made dividend payments in the amount of  during the twelve months to december  as compared to  in this strong cash performance has resulted in the company being able to report a cash balance at december  of  as compared to  at december  the company has various loans in place that together constitute the short term and long term loan balances shown in the balance sheet as at december  and december  these are summarized in the following table indebtedness at december  at december  s long term short term total long term short term total term loan notes payable on product acquisitions and asset purchases total indebtedness on january   the company s main operating subsidiary  amvac  as borrower  and affiliates including the company  as guarantors  entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement with a group of commercial lenders led by bank of the west amvac s primary bank as agent  swing line lender and letter of credit issuer

recently issued accounting guidance in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  establishes new requirements for disclosing reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income oci 
specifically  disclosure is required of the changes in components of accumulated oci  disclosure is required of the effects on individual line items in net income for each item of accumulated oci that is reclassified in its entirety to net income  and cross references are required to other disclosures that provide additional details for oci items that are not reclassified in their entirety to net income 
the requirements of asu apply to all entities ie  both public and nonpublic that report items of oci in any period presented 
asu is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  in october  fasb issued asu no 
 technical corrections and improvements

in response to the requests from financial users for comparability on the differences that resulted in offsetting assets and liabilities under us gaap requirements versus international financial reporting standards ifrs requirements  the fasb and the international accounting standards board  iasb jointly issued this update to enhance current disclosures 
entities are required to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
this scope would include derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements 
the objective of this disclosure is to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of us gaap and those entities that prepare their financial statements on the basis of ifrs 
the amendments in this update affect all entities that have financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset in accordance with either section or section or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
the requirements amend the disclosure requirements on offsetting in section an entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
the company is evaluating the effect of this guidance but does not expect it to have a significant impact on its financial statements 
foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the company s ability to sell products at agreed upon prices denominated in us dollars 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future 
should adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations occur in geographies where the company sells exports its products  management is not certain such fluctuations will or will not materially impact the company s operating results 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years 
however  raw material prices have increased approximately during the course of and are expected to continue to increase during and beyond due to the growth in global economies  particularly in china and india 
this growth will put further pressure on supply demands of raw materials and will cause continual inflationary pressures to throughout and critical accounting policies certain of the company s policies require the application of judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  commonly accepted industry practices and other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries dollars in thousands  except per share data the company s critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue from sales is recognized at the time title and the risks of ownership pass 
this is when the customer has made the fixed commitment to purchase the goods  the products are shipped per the customer s instructions  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company has in place procedures to ensure that revenue is recognized when earned 
the procedures are subject to management s review and from time to time certain sales are excluded until it is clear that the title has passed and there is no further recourse to the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed using either standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusted for current economic conditions or by evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
accrued program costs in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  the company classifies certain payments to its customers as a reduction of sales revenues 
the company describes these payments as programs 
programs are a critical part of doing business in the agricultural chemicals business place 
for accounting purposes  programs are recorded as a reduction in gross sales and include market pricing adjustments  volume take up or other key performance indicator driven payments made to distributors  retailers or growers at the end of a growing season 
each quarter management compares each sale transaction with published programs to determine what program liability has been incurred 
once this initial calculation is made for the specific quarter  sales and marketing management along with executive and financial management review the accumulated program balance and make assessments of whether or not customers are tracking in a manner that indicates that they will meet the requirements set out in the terms and conditions attached to each program 
if management believes that customers are falling short of their annual goals then periodic adjustments will be made to the accumulated accrual to properly reflect the company s best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date 
the majority of adjustments are made at the end of the crop season at which time customer performance can be fully assessed 
programs are paid out predominantly on an annual basis  usually in the final quarter of the financial year or the first quarter of the following year 
long lived assets the carrying value of long lived assets is reviewed for impairment quarterly and or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
generally  the fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
management considers the carrying value of long lived assets to be reasonable

foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  where the local currency is the functional currency  have been translated at period end exchange rates and profit and loss accounts have been translated using weighted average yearly exchange rates 
adjustments resulting from translation have been recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as cumulative translation adjustments in other comprehensive income loss 
the effect of foreign currency exchange gains and losses on transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency are re measured to the functional currency using the end of the period exchange rates

the company adopted the provisions of fasb asc under the provisions of fasb asc  identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those with indefinite lives are not amortized 
the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset to the company is based upon a number of factors including the effects of demand  competition  and expected changes in the marketability of the company s products 
the company re evaluates whether these intangible assets are impaired on an annual basis  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans and future cash flows 
identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate elements of property 
the impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss  if any  is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset s being tested for impairment as well as selecting a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
when determining future cash flow estimates  the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the company  in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions  product pricing and necessary capital expenditures 
the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for long lived assets  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
the company has performed an impairment review for the year ending december and there were no impairment losses recorded 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying values of cash  receivables and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments 
the fair value of the company s long term debt and note payable to our lender group is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the company for debt of the same remaining maturities 
such fair value approximates the respective carrying values of the company s long term debt and note payable to bank

the company s discounted cash flow techniques use observable market inputs  such as libor based yield curves and foreign currency forward rates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  primarily from its borrowing activities 
the company s indebtedness to its primary lender is evidenced by a line of credit with a variable rate of interest  which fluctuates with changes in the lender s reference rate 
the company may use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes to protect trading performance from exchange rate fluctuations on material contracts  also  as a condition of the company s credit agreement with its banks  the company is required to maintain in effect interest rate swap agreement s for a notional amount not less than one half of the principal amount of its term loan originally the term loan was  at any given time 
the company conducts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe  mexico  central and south america 
therefore changes in the value of the currencies of such countries or regions affect the company s financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
the company has mitigated  and will continue to mitigate  a portion of its currency exchange exposure through natural hedges based on the operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which the majority of all costs are local currency based 
a change in the value of all foreign currencies would have an immaterial effect on the company s financial position and cash flows 
as part of an on going process of assessing business risk  management has identified risk factors which are disclosed in item a
