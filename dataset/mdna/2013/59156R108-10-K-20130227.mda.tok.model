on november  the alico acquisition date  metlife  inc completed the acquisition of american life insurance company american life from am holdings llc formerly known as alico holdings llc am holdings  a subsidiary of american international group  inc aig  and delaware american life insurance company delam from aig american life  together with delam  collectively  alico the alico acquisition 
the assets  liabilities and operating results relating to the alico acquisition are 
table of contents included in the latin america  asia and emea segments 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain international subsidiaries have a fiscal year end of november accordingly  the company s consolidated financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries as of november  and and the operating results of such subsidiaries for the years ended november   and we continue to experience an increase in sales in several of our businesses  however  global economic conditions continue to negatively impact the demand for some of our products 
portfolio growth  resulting from strong sales in the majority of our businesses  drove positive investment results and higher asset based fee revenue 
changes in interest rates and the impact of the nonperformance risk adjustment on variable annuity embedded derivatives resulted in significant derivative losses 
in addition  a goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the current year  as well as a charge associated with the global review of assumptions related to deferred policy acquisition costs dac  reserves and certain intangibles 
years ended december  in millions income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax less net investment gains losses less net derivative gains losses less goodwill impairment less other adjustments to continuing operations less provision for income tax expense benefit operating earnings less preferred stock dividends operating earnings available to common shareholders see definitions of operating revenues and operating expenses for the components of such adjustments 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  during the year ended december   income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  decreased billion from the prior year 
the change was predominantly due to a billion billion  net of income tax  unfavorable change in net derivative gains losses primarily driven by changes in interest rates  the weakening of the us dollar and japanese yen  equity market movements  decreased volatility and the impact of a nonperformance risk adjustment 
in addition  the current year includes a billion billion  net of income tax non cash charge for goodwill impairment associated with our us retail annuities business 
the current year also includes a billion million  net of income tax charge associated with the global review of assumptions related to dac  reserves and certain intangibles  of which million million  net of income tax was reflected in net derivative gains losses 
also included in income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  were the unfavorable results of the discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by metlife  inc divested businesses  which decreased million million  net of income tax from the prior year 
these declines were partially offset by a billion  net of income tax  increase in operating earnings available to common shareholders 
the increase in operating earnings available to common shareholders was primarily driven by improved investment results and higher asset based fee revenue as strong sales levels drove portfolio growth 
in addition  the low interest rate environment resulted in lower average interest credited rates 
despite the impact of superstorm sandy  catastrophe losses were lower in as compared to the significant weather related claims in in addition  the prior year included a million  net of income tax  charge in connection with the company s use of the us social security administration s death master file 
the prior year also included 
table of contents million  net of income tax  of expenses incurred related to a liquidation plan filed by the new york state department of financial services the department of financial services for executive life insurance company of new york elny 
current year results include a million  net of income tax  charge representing a multi state examination payment related to unclaimed property and metlife s use of the us social security administration s death master file to identify potential life insurance claims  as well as the expected acceleration of benefit payments to policyholders under the settlements 
the current year also includes a million  net of income tax  impairment charge on an intangible asset related to a previously acquired dental business 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  during the year ended december   income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  increased billion over the change was predominantly due to a billion billion  net of income tax favorable change in net derivative gains losses primarily due to the impact of falling long term and mid term interest rates and equity market movements and volatility 
in addition  a billion  net of income tax  favorable change in operating earnings available to common shareholders  which includes the impact of the alico acquisition  also contributed to the increase 
the alico acquisition drove the majority of the billion increase in operating earnings available to common shareholders 
in addition  improved investment performance was driven by portfolio growth resulting from increased sales across many of our businesses  which more than offset the negative impact of the declining interest rate environment on yields 
current year results were negatively impacted by severe weather  as well as  in the third quarter of  a charge to increase reserves in connection with the company s use of the us social security administration s death master file and similar databases to identify potential life insurance claims that have not been presented to the company and expenses incurred related to a liquidation plan filed by the department of financial services for elny 
consolidated company outlook in  despite pressure from low interest rates  we expect operating earnings to be in line with  driven primarily by the following growth in premiums  fees and other revenues driven by rational pricing strategy in the group insurance marketplace  increases in our businesses outside of the us  notably accident health  from continuing organic growth throughout our various geographic regions and leveraging of our multichannel distribution network 
expanding our presence in emerging markets  including potential merger and acquisition activity 
focus on disciplined underwriting 
we see no significant changes to the underlying trends that drive underwriting results  however  unanticipated catastrophes  similar to superstorm sandy could result in a high volume of claims 
focus on expense management in the light of the low interest rate environment  and continue to focus on expense control throughout the company 
continued disciplined approach to investing and asset liability management alm  including significant hedging to protect against low interest rates and the purchasing of derivatives to protect against higher interest rates 
we expect only modest investment losses in  but more difficult to predict is the impact of potential changes in fair value of freestanding and embedded derivatives as even relatively small movements in market variables  including interest rates  equity levels and volatility  can have a large impact on the fair value of 
table of contents derivatives and net derivative gains losses 
additionally  changes in fair value of embedded derivatives within certain insurance liabilities may have a material impact on net derivative gains losses related to the inclusion of a nonperformance risk adjustment 
as part of an enterprise wide strategic initiative  by  we expect to increase our operating return on common equity to the low end of the to range  driven by higher operating earnings 
if we were to assume no share buybacks through year end  our estimated operating return on equity target range for would be approximately basis points lower than this previously noted range  all other assumptions held constant 
we will leverage our scale to improve the value we provide to customers and shareholders in order to achieve billion in efficiencies  million of which is expected to be related to net pre tax expense savings  and million of which we expect to be reinvested in our technology  platforms and functionality to improve our current operations and develop new capabilities 
additionally  we will shift our product mix toward protection products and away from more capital intensive products  in order to generate more predictable operating earnings and cash flows  and improve our risk profile and free cash flow 
we expect that by  more than of our operating earnings will come from emerging markets 
impact of superstorm sandy on october   superstorm sandy made landfall in the northeastern united states causing extensive property damage 
metlife s property casualty business gross losses from superstorm sandy were approximately million  before income tax 
as of december   we recognized total net losses related to the catastrophe of million  net of income tax and reinsurance recoverables and including reinstatement premiums  which impacted the retail and group  voluntary worksite benefits segments 
the retail and group  voluntary worksite benefits segments recorded net losses related to the catastrophe of million and million  each net of income tax reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums  respectively 
additional storm related losses may be recorded in future periods as claims are received from insureds and claims to reinsurers are processed 
reinsurance recoveries are dependent on the continued creditworthiness of the reinsurers  which may be affected by their other reinsured losses in connection with superstorm sandy and otherwise 
industry trends we continue to be impacted by the unstable global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry 
financial and economic environment our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally 
stressed conditions  volatility and disruptions in global capital markets  particular markets  or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us  in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors 
global market factors  including interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices  real estate markets  foreign currency exchange rates  consumer spending  business investment  government spending  the volatility and strength of the capital markets  deflation and inflation  all affect the business and economic environment and  ultimately  the amount and profitability of our business 
disruptions in one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes 
upheavals in the financial markets can also affect our business through their effects on general levels of economic activity  employment and customer behavior 
while our diversified business mix and geographically diverse business operations partially mitigate these risks  correlation across regions  countries and global market factors may reduce the benefits of diversification 
financial markets have also been affected by concerns over us fiscal policy 
while uncertainty regarding the fiscal cliff a series of tax increases and automatic government spending cuts that would have become effective at the beginning of has been abated following a last minute congressional compromise on january  
table of contents questions over the direction of us fiscal policy remain as a result of further congressional action that will be needed to again raise the us federal government s debt ceiling by august unless steps are taken to raise the debt ceiling and reduce the federal deficit  rating agencies have warned of the possibility of future downgrades of us treasury securities 
these issues could  on their own  or combined with the slowing of the global economy generally  send the us into a new recession  have severe repercussions to the us and global credit and financial markets  further exacerbate concerns over sovereign debt of other countries and disrupt economic activity in the us and elsewhere 
in september  moody s investors service moody s changed its outlook for the us life insurance industry to negative from stable  saying it expects interest rates to remain in the low single digits for the next few years  depressing such companies earnings 
in june  moody s announced that it downgraded the long term ratings and standalone credit for a number of banks and securities firms with global capital markets operations 
through our ongoing credit evaluation process  we have been closely monitoring our financial institution investment holdings  including the impact of the moody s downgrades to these institutions  and do not expect these downgrades to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
concerns about economic conditions  capital markets and the solvency of certain european union member states  including portugal  ireland  italy  greece and spain europe s perimeter region and cyprus  and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by these countries  have been a cause of elevated levels of market volatility 
see investments current environment for information regarding credit ratings downgrades  support programs for europe s perimeter region and our exposure to obligations of european governments and private obligors 
the financial markets have also been affected by concerns that other european union member states could experience similar financial troubles  that some countries could default on their obligations  have to restructure their outstanding debt  or be unable or unwilling to comply with the terms of any aid provided to them  that financial institutions with significant holdings of sovereign or private debt issued by borrowers in europe s perimeter region could experience financial stress  or that one or more countries may exit the euro zone  any of which could have significant adverse effects on the european and global economies and on financial markets  generally 
in september  the european central bank ecb announced a new bond buying program  outright monetary transactions  intended to stabilize the european financial crisis and help certain countries struggling with their levels of sovereign debt 
this program involves the purchase by the ecb of unlimited quantities of short term sovereign bonds  with maturities of one to three years 
these large scale purchases of short term sovereign bonds are intended to increase the price of the bonds  and lower their interest rates  making it less expensive for certain countries to borrow money 
as a condition to participating in this program  countries must agree to strict levels of economic reform and oversight 
see risk factors economic environment and capital markets related risks we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  and may cause our net investment income to vary from period to period 
the japanese economy  to which we face substantial exposure given our operations there  has experienced weak economic performance for over two decades and a long period of deflation  which have led to a deterioration in public finances 
the global financial crisis and march earthquake further pressured japan s budget outcomes and public debt levels 
going forward  japan s structural and demographic challenges may continue to limit its potential growth unless reforms that boost productivity are put into place 
japan s high public sector debt levels are mitigated by low refinancing risks and its nominal yields on government debt have remained at a lower level than that of any other advanced country 
however  frequent changes in government have prevented policy makers from implementing fiscal reform measures to put public finances on a sustainable path 
in january  the government and the bank of japan pledged to strengthen policy coordination to end deflation and to achieve sustainable economic growth 
this was followed by the announcement of a supplementary budget stimulus program totaling of gross domestic product and the adoption of a inflation target by the bank of japan 
although the yen has weakened and the stock market has rallied on the back of these announcements  it is too soon to tell whether these actions will have a sustained impact on japan s economy 
japan s public debt trajectory could continue to rise until a strategy to boost longer term growth is implemented 

table of contents impact of a sustained low interest rate environment as a global insurance company  we are affected by the monetary policy of central banks around the world 
in the united states  the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board has taken a number of actions in recent years to spur economic activity by keeping interest rates low and may take further actions to influence interest rates in the future  which may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk bearing investments  and may adversely impact the level of product sales 
in december  the federal reserve board s federal open market committee fomc reiterated its plan to keep interest rates low until such time as certain numerical thresholds are met  including with respect to the rates of unemployment  inflation and long term inflation 
it also announced that it will continue purchasing agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of billion per month and will purchase longer term us treasury securities at a pace of billion per month 
taken together  these actions are intended to maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates  support mortgage markets  and contribute to a broad easing of financial market conditions that could provide additional stimulus to support the economic recovery 
based on the fomc s january meeting  however  it is possible that the extent of this quantitative easing could be varied in amount  gradually reduced  or even ended earlier than originally anticipated depending on the pace of economic recovery  including substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market 
central banks in other parts of the world  including the ecb  the bank of england  the bank of japan  the bank of australia  the central bank of brazil and the central bank of china  have followed the recent actions of the federal reserve board to lower interest rates 
the collective effort globally to lower interest rates was in response to concerns about europe s sovereign debt crisis and slowing global economic growth 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect of these programs and policies on interest rates or the impact on the pricing levels of risk bearing investments at this time 
see investments current environment 
in periods of declining interest rates  we may have to invest insurance cash flows and reinvest the cash flows we received as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments 
moreover  borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities  commercial or agricultural mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates 
therefore  some of our products expose us to the risk that a reduction in interest rates will reduce the difference between the amounts that we are required to credit on contracts in our general account and the rate of return we are able to earn on investments intended to support obligations under these contracts 
this difference between interest earned and interest credited  or margin  is a key metric for the management of  and reporting for  many of our businesses 
our expectations regarding future margins are an important component impacting the amortization of certain intangible assets such as dac and value of business acquired voba 
significantly lower margins may cause us to accelerate the amortization  thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period 
additionally  lower margins may also impact the recoverability of intangible assets such as goodwill  require the establishment of additional liabilities or trigger loss recognition events on certain policyholder liabilities 
we review this long term margin assumption  along with other assumptions  as part of our annual assumption review 
although the analysis shown below considers low interest rates in and  it does not assume any change to our long term assumption for margins 
as a result  the impact of a hypothetical interest rate stress scenario described below does not capture the impact of any of the aforementioned items 
mitigating actions 
the company has been and continues to be proactive in its investment strategies  product designs  and interest crediting rate strategies to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequences from the low interest rate environment 
lowering interest crediting rates on some products  or adjusting the dividend scale on traditional products  can help offset decreases in investment margins on some products 
our ability to lower interest crediting rates could be limited by competition  regulatory approval  or contractual guarantees of minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields 
as a result  our margins could decrease or potentially become negative 
the company applies disciplined alm strategies  including the 
table of contents use of derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  floors and swaptions  to mitigate the risk of sustained low interest rates in the us a significant portion of these derivatives were entered into prior to the onset of the current low us interest rate environment 
in some cases  the company has entered into offsetting positions as part of its overall alm strategy and to reduce volatility in net income 
business actions  such as shifting the sales focus to less interest rate sensitive products  can also mitigate this risk 
in addition  the company is well diversified across product  distribution  and geography 
certain of our non us businesses  reported within our latin america and emea segments  which accounted for approximately of our operating earnings in  are not significantly interest rate or market sensitive  particularly to any direct sensitivity to us rates 
the company s primary exposure within these segments is insurance risk 
we expect our non us businesses to grow faster than our us businesses and  over time  to become a larger percentage of our total business 
as a result of the foregoing  the company expects to be able to substantially mitigate the negative impact of a sustained low interest rate environment in the us on the company s profitability 
based on a near to intermediate term analysis of a sustained lower interest rate environment in the us  the company anticipates operating earnings will continue to increase  although at a slower growth rate 
interest rate stress scenario the following summarizes the impact of a hypothetical interest rate stress scenario on our operating earnings and the mark to market impact of our derivative positions that do not qualify as accounting hedges assuming a continued low interest rate environment in the us the hypothetical interest rate stress scenario is based on a constant set of us interest rates and credit spreads in the us  as compared to our business plan interest rates and credit spreads  which are based on consensus interest rate view and credit spreads as of october  for example  our business plan assumes a year treasury rate of at december  to rise during to by december  and remain at until december  the hypothetical interest rate stress scenario assumes the year treasury rate to be at december  and remain constant at that level until december  we make similar assumptions for interest rates at other maturities  and hold this interest rate curve constant through december  in addition  in the interest rate stress scenario  we assume credit spreads remain constant from december through the end of  as compared to our business plan which assumes rising credit spreads through and thereafter remaining constant through the end of further  we also are including the impact of low interest rates on our pension and post retirement plan expenses 
we allocate this impact across our segments  it is included in the segment discussion below 
the discount rate used to value these plans is tied to long term high quality corporate bond yields 
accordingly  an extended low interest rate environment will result in increased pension and other post retirement benefit liabilities and expenses 
higher total return on the fixed income portfolio of pension and other post retirement benefit plan assets will partially offset this increase in pension and other post retirement plan liabilities 
based on the above assumptions  we estimate the impact of the hypothetical us interest rate stress scenario on our consolidated operating earnings to be a decrease of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
as previously mentioned  operating earnings is the measure of segment profit and loss that we use to evaluate segment performance and allocated resources 
further  we believe the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business 
the most directly comparable gaap measure is not accessible on a forward looking basis because we believe it is not possible to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses  which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range from period to period and may have a significant impact on gaap net income 
see non gaap and other financial disclosures for definitions of such measures 

table of contents in addition to the impact on operating earnings  we estimated the effect on the mark to market impact of our derivative positions that do not qualify as accounting hedges 
we applied the hypothetical us interest rate stress scenario to these derivatives and compared the impact to that based on rates in our business plan 
we hold a significant position in long duration receive fixed interest rate swaps to hedge reinvestment risk 
these swaps are most sensitive to the year and year swap rates and we recognize gains as rates drop and recognize losses as rates rise 
this estimated impact on the derivative mark to market does not include that of our va program derivatives as the impact of low interest rates in the freestanding derivatives would be largely offset by the mark to market in earnings for the related embedded derivative 
see results of operations consolidated results for discussions on our net derivative gains and losses 
based on these additional assumptions  we estimate the impact of the hypothetical us interest rate stress scenario on the mark to market of our derivative positions that do not qualify as accounting hedges to be an increase in income of million to million and a decrease in income of million to an increase in income of million in and  respectively 
segments and corporate other the following discussion summarizes the impact of the above hypothetical us interest rate stress scenario on the operating earnings of our segments  as well as corporate other 
see also policyholder liabilities policyholder account balances for information regarding the account values subject to minimum guaranteed credited rates 
retail life other our interest rate sensitive products include traditional life  universal life  and retained asset accounts 
because the majority of our traditional life insurance business is participating  we can largely offset lower investment returns on assets backing our traditional life products through adjustments to the applicable dividend scale 
in our universal life products  we manage interest rate risk through a combination of product design features and alm strategies  including the use of hedges such as interest rate swaps and floors 
while the company has the ability to lower crediting rates on certain in force universal life policies to mitigate margin compression  such actions would be partially offset by increases in our liabilities related to those with secondary guarantees 
our retained asset accounts have minimum interest crediting rate guarantees which range from to  all of which are currently at their respective minimum interest crediting rates 
while we expect to experience margin compression as we re invest at lower rates  interest rate floors purchased in this portfolio will partially mitigate this risk 
annuities the impact on operating earnings from margin compression is concentrated in our deferred annuities where there are minimum interest rate guarantees 
under low us interest rate scenarios  we assume that a larger percentage of customers will maintain their funds with the company to take advantage of the attractive minimum guaranteed rates and we expect to experience margin compression as we reinvest cash flows at lower interest rates 
partially offsetting this margin compression  we assume we will lower crediting rates on their contractual reset dates for the portion of business that is not currently at minimum crediting rates 
additionally  we have various derivative positions  primarily interest rate floors  to partially mitigate this risk 
reinvestment risk is defined here as the amount of reinvestment in and that would impact operating earnings due to reinvesting cash flows in the hypothetical interest rate stress scenario 
for the deferred annuities business  billion and billion in and  respectively of the asset base will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of billion and billion in and  respectively 
we estimate an unfavorable operating earnings impact in our retail segment from the hypothetical us interest rate stress scenario noted above of million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents group  voluntary worksite benefits group in general  most of our group life insurance products in this segment are renewable term insurance and  therefore  have significant repricing flexibility 
interest rate risk mainly arises from minimum interest rate guarantees on retained asset accounts 
these accounts have minimum interest crediting rate guarantees which range from to 
all of these account balances are currently at their respective minimum interest crediting rates and we expect to experience margin compression as we reinvest at lower interest rates 
we have used interest rate floors to partially mitigate the risks of a sustained us low interest rate environment 
we also have exposure to interest rate risk in this business arising from our group disability policy claim reserves 
for these products  lower reinvestment rates cannot be offset by a reduction in liability crediting rates for established claim reserves 
group disability policies are generally renewable term policies 
rates may be adjusted on in force policies at renewal based on the retrospective experience rating and current interest rate assumptions 
we review the discount rate assumptions and other assumptions associated with our long term disability claim reserves no less frequently than annually 
our most recent review at the end of resulted in no change to the applicable discount rates 
voluntary worksite we have exposure to interest rate risk in this business arising mainly from our long term care ltc policy reserves 
for these products  lower reinvestment rates cannot be offset by a reduction in liability crediting rates for established claim reserves 
ltc policies are generally guaranteed renewable  and rates may be adjusted on a class basis with regulatory approval to reflect emerging experience 
our ltc block is closed to new business 
the company makes use of derivative instruments to more closely match asset and liability duration and immunize the portfolio against changes in interest rates 
reinvestment risk is defined here as the amount of reinvestment in and that would impact operating earnings due to reinvesting cash flows in the hypothetical interest rate stress scenario 
for the ltc portfolio  billion of the asset base in both and will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of billion and billion in and  respectively 
we estimate an unfavorable operating earnings impact in our group  voluntary worksite benefits segment from the hypothetical us interest rate stress scenario noted above of million and million in and  respectively 
corporate benefit funding this segment contains both short and long duration products consisting of capital market products  pension closeouts  structured settlements  and other benefit funding products 
the majority of short duration products are managed on a floating rate basis  which mitigates the impact of the low interest rate environment in the us the long duration products have very predictable cash flows and we have matched these cash flows through our alm practices 
we also use interest rate swaps to help protect income in this segment against a low interest rate environment in the us based on the cash flow estimates  only a small component is subject to reinvestment risk 
reinvestment risk is defined here as the amount of reinvestment in and that would impact operating earnings due to reinvesting cash flows in the hypothetical interest rate stress scenario 
for the long duration business  and billion of the asset base in and  respectively  will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of billion and billion in and  respectively 
we estimate an unfavorable operating earnings impact in our corporate benefit funding segment from the hypothetical us interest rate stress scenario noted above of and million in and  respectively 
asia our asia segment has a portion of its investments in us dollar denominated assets 
the following represents the impact on our asia segment s operating earnings under the hypothetical us interest rate stress scenario 

table of contents life other our japan business offers traditional life insurance and accident health products 
to the extent the japan life insurance portfolio is us interest rate sensitive and we are unable to lower crediting rates to the customer  operating earnings will decline 
we manage interest rate risk on our life products through a combination of product design features and alm strategies 
annuities we sell annuities in asia which are predominantly single premium products with crediting rates set at the time of issue 
this allows us to tightly manage product alm  cash flows and net spreads  thus maintaining profitability 
we estimate an unfavorable operating earnings impact in our asia segment from the hypothetical us interest rate stress scenario noted above of million and million in and  respectively 
corporate other corporate other contains the surplus portfolios for the enterprise  as well as the portfolios used to fund the capital needs of the company 
in addition  there are various reinsurance products 
the surplus portfolios are subject to reinvestment risk  however lower net investment income is significantly offset by lower interest expense on both fixed and variable rate debt 
under a lower interest rate environment  fixed rate debt is assumed to be either paid off when it matures or refinanced at a lower interest rate resulting in lower overall interest expense 
variable rate debt is indexed to the three month libor  which results in lower interest expense incurred 
we estimate an unfavorable operating earnings impact in corporate other from the hypothetical us interest rate stress scenario noted above of million and million in and  respectively 
competitive pressures the life insurance industry remains highly competitive 
the product development and product life cycles have shortened in many product segments  leading to more intense competition with respect to product features 
larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity  product development  technology and risk management  which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry 
in addition  several of the industry s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition 
sufficient scale  financial strength and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry 
larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional distribution capability and the information technology needed to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base 
we believe that the continued volatility of the financial markets  its impact on the capital position of many competitors  and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have altered the competitive environment 
in particular  we believe that these factors have highlighted financial strength as the most significant differentiator from the perspective of some customers and certain distributors 
we believe the company is well positioned to compete in this environment 
see business competition 
regulatory developments the us life insurance industry is regulated primarily at the state level  with some products and services also subject to federal regulation 
as life insurers introduce new and often more complex products  regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry 
regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the industry 
in addition  regulators have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products  including equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and group products  as well as reviews of the utilization of affiliated captive reinsurers or off shore entities to reinsure insurance risks 
the regulation of the global financial services industry has received renewed scrutiny as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets 
significant regulatory reforms have been recently adopted and additional reforms proposed  and these or 
table of contents other reforms could be implemented

in april  metlife  inc announced it was exiting the businesses of originating and servicing reverse residential mortgage loans and that metlife bank and metlife  inc entered into a definitive agreement to sell metlife bank s reverse mortgage servicing portfolio 
in june  the company sold the majority of metlife bank s reverse mortgage servicing rights and related assets and liabilities  with the remainder sold in september pursuant to the same sales agreement 
on november   metlife bank and metlife  inc entered into a definitive agreement to sell metlife bank s forward mortgage servicing portfolio to jpmorgan chase bank  na jpmorgan chase 
the rights and obligations of the forward mortgage servicing portfolio were assumed by jpmorgan chase on december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the metlife bank divestiture 
in conjunction with the sales of residential mortgage loans and servicing portfolios  metlife bank has made representations and warranties that the loans sold met certain requirements relating  for example  to the underwriting and origination of the loans  and that the loans were serviced in accordance with investor guidelines 
notwithstanding its exit from the origination and servicing businesses  metlife bank remains obligated to repurchase loans or compensate for losses upon demand due to alleged defects by metlife bank or its predecessor servicers in past servicing of the loans and material representations made in connection with metlife bank s sale of the loans 
at the time the servicing portfolios were sold metlife bank was servicing billion in mortgage loans  of which billion were originated by metlife bank  and which loans were subject to both origination and servicing representations and warranties 
estimation of repurchase liability arising from breaches of origination representations and warranties requires considerable management judgment 
metlife bank considers the level of outstanding unresolved repurchase demands and challenges to mortgage insurance  probable future demands in light of historical experience and changes in general economic conditions such as unemployment and the housing market  and the likelihood of recovery from indemnifications made to metlife bank relating to loans that metlife bank acquired rather than originated 
reserves for representation and warranty repurchases and indemnifications were million and million at december  and  respectively 
reserves for estimated future losses due to alleged servicing deficiencies on loans originated and sold  as well as servicing acquired  are estimated based on unresolved claims as well as projected losses under investor servicing contracts where metlife bank s past actions or inactions are likely to result in missing certain stipulated investor timelines 
reserves for servicing defects were million and million at december  and  respectively 
management is satisfied that adequate provision has been made in the company s consolidated financial statements for those representation and warrant obligations that are currently probable and reasonably estimable 

table of contents state and federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities have initiated various inquiries  investigations or examinations of alleged irregularities in the foreclosure practices of the residential mortgage servicing industry 
mortgage servicing practices have also been the subject of congressional attention 
authorities have publicly stated that the scope of the investigations extends beyond foreclosure documentation practices to include mortgage loan modification and loss mitigation practices 
on april   the office of the comptroller of the currency occ entered into consent orders with several banks  including metlife bank 
the consent orders require an independent review of foreclosure practices and set forth new residential mortgage servicing standards  including a requirement for a designated point of contact for a borrower during the loss mitigation process 
in the first quarter of  metlife bank entered into an agreement in principle with the occ to settle obligations related to the independent foreclosure review required by its consent order 
under the agreement in principle  the foreclosure review will end and metlife bank will pay approximately million 
in addition  the federal reserve board entered into consent orders with the affiliated bank holding companies of these banks  including metlife  inc  to enhance the supervision of the mortgage servicing activities of their banking subsidiaries 
on august   the federal reserve board issued an order of assessment of a civil monetary penalty issued upon consent against metlife  inc that will impose a penalty of up to million for the alleged deficiencies in oversight of metlife bank s servicing of residential mortgage loans and processing foreclosures that were the subject of the consent order 
metlife bank also had a meeting with the department of justice regarding mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices 
it is possible that various state or federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities may seek monetary penalties from metlife bank relating to foreclosure practices 
metlife bank has also responded to a subpoena issued by the department of financial services regarding hazard insurance and flood insurance that metlife bank obtains to protect the lienholder s interest when the borrower s insurance has lapsed 
in april and may  metlife bank received two subpoenas issued by the office of inspector general for the us department of housing and urban development regarding federal housing administration fha insured loans 
in june and september  metlife bank received two civil investigative demands that the us department of justice issued as part of a false claims act investigation of allegations that metlife bank had improperly originated and or underwritten loans insured by the fha 
the consent decrees  as well as the inquiries or investigations referred to above  could adversely affect metlife s reputation or result in significant fines  penalties  equitable remedies or other enforcement actions  and result in significant legal costs in responding to governmental investigations or other litigation 
the metlife bank divestiture may not relieve metlife from complying with the consent decrees  or protect it from the inquiries and investigations relating to residential mortgage servicing and foreclosure activities  or any fines  penalties  equitable remedies or enforcement actions that may result  the costs of responding to any such governmental investigations  or other litigation 
summary of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of our significant accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the most critical estimates include those used in determining i liabilities for future policyholder benefits and the accounting for reinsurance  ii capitalization and amortization of dac and the establishment and amortization of voba  iii estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values  iv investment impairments  
table of contents v estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation  vi measurement of goodwill and related impairment  vii measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities  viii measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets  and ix liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters 
in addition  the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the most significant of which relate to aforementioned critical accounting estimates 
in applying our accounting policies  we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to our business and operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
liability for future policy benefits generally  future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid  reduced by the present value of future expected premiums 
such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  disability incidence  disability terminations  investment returns  inflation  expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable 
utilizing these assumptions  liabilities are established on a block of business basis 
if experience is less favorable than assumed  additional liabilities may be established  resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims 
future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations  expenses and interest 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs  reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance  recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
the assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing dac  and are thus subject to the same variability and risk 
the assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index  such as the standard poor s rating services index 
we regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience 
differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees  as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities  result in variances in profit and could result in losses 

table of contents see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits 
reinsurance accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates  particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks 
we periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed subsequently 
additionally  for each of our reinsurance agreements  we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
we review all contractual features  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk  we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs 
deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business 
costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are deferred as dac 
in addition to commissions  certain direct response advertising expenses and other direct costs  deferrable costs include the portion of an employee s total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling  underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed 
we utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee s time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales  including surveys  interviews  representative time studies and other methods 
these estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis or more frequently to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods 
voba represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance  annuity  and investment type contracts in force at the acquisition date 
for certain acquired blocks of business  the estimated fair value of the in force contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed in force insurance policy liabilities  resulting in negative voba  which is presented separately from voba as an additional insurance liability included in other policy related balances 
the estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on projections  by each block of business  of future policy and contract charges  premiums  mortality and morbidity  separate account performance  surrenders  operating expenses  investment returns  nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors 
actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections 
the recovery of dac and voba is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
separate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in force account balances on such contracts each reporting period  which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of dac and voba 
our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short term market fluctuations  but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected 
we monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long term expectation changes 
the effect of an increase decrease by basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease increase in the dac and voba amortization of approximately million  with an offset to our unearned revenue liability of approximately million for this factor 
we use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long term separate account return after the five year reversion period is over 
the current long term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is for the us 
table of contents we also periodically review other long term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits 
these assumptions primarily relate to investment returns  policyholder dividend scales  interest crediting rates  mortality  persistency  and expenses to administer business 
assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually 
if the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase  dac and voba amortization will decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease 
our most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of dac and voba are due to revisions to expected future investment returns  expenses  in force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts  variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts 
we expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time 
at december   and  dac and voba for the company was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
amortization of dac and voba associated with the variable and universal life and the annuity contracts was significantly impacted by movements in equity markets 
the following illustrates the effect on dac and voba of changing each of the respective assumptions  as well as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during the years ended december   and increases decreases in dac and voba balances  as presented below  resulted in a corresponding decrease increase in amortization 
years ended december  in millions investment return separate account balances net investment gain loss guaranteed minimum income benefits expense in force persistency policyholder dividends and other total the following represents significant items contributing to the changes to dac and voba amortization in the increase in actual  as well as changes in projected  investment returns resulted in an increase in actual and a reduction in expected future gross profits on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts resulting in an increase of million in dac and voba amortization 
better than expected persistency and changes in assumptions regarding persistency  especially in the us deferred variable annuity contracts  resulted in an increase in actual and expected future gross profits resulting in a decrease of million in dac and voba amortization 
the following represents significant items contributing to the changes to dac and voba amortization in the decrease in equity markets during the year lowered separate account balances  which led to a reduction in actual and expected future gross profits on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts resulting in an increase of million in dac and voba amortization 

table of contents changes in net investment gains losses resulted in the following changes in dac and voba amortization actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities  resulting in a decrease of dac and voba amortization of million  excluding the impact from our nonperformance risk and risk margins  which are described below 
this decrease in actual gross profits was more than offset by freestanding derivative gains associated with the hedging of such guarantee obligations  which resulted in an increase in dac and voba amortization of million 
the widening of the company s nonperformance risk adjustment decreased the valuation of guarantee liabilities  increased actual gross profits and increased dac and voba amortization by million 
this was partially offset by higher risk margins  which increased the guarantee liability valuations  decreased actual gross profits and decreased dac and voba amortization by million 
the remainder of the impact of net investment gains losses  which increased dac and voba amortization by million  was primarily attributable to current period investment activities 
the following represents significant items contributing to the changes to dac and voba amortization in changes in net investment gains losses resulted in the following changes in dac and voba amortization actual gross profits increased as a result of a decrease in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities  resulting in an increase of dac and voba amortization of million  excluding the impact from our nonperformance risk and risk margins  which are described below 
this increase in actual gross profits was partially offset by freestanding derivative losses associated with the hedging of such guarantee obligations  which resulted in a decrease in dac and voba amortization of million 
the narrowing of our nonperformance risk adjustment increased the valuation of guarantee liabilities  decreased actual gross profits and decreased dac and voba amortization by million 
in addition  higher risk margins  which increased the guarantee liability valuations  decreased actual gross profits and decreased dac and voba amortization by million 
the remainder of the impact of net investment gains losses  which increased dac and voba amortization by million  was primarily attributable to current period investment activities 
included in policyholder dividends and other was an increase in dac and voba amortization of million as a result of favorable gross margin variances 
the remainder of the increase was due to various immaterial items 
our dac and voba balance is also impacted by unrealized investment gains losses and the amount of amortization which would have been recognized if such gains and losses had been realized 
the increase in unrealized investment gains decreased the dac and voba balance by million  million and billion in  and  respectively 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the dac and voba offset to unrealized investment losses 
estimated fair value of investments in determining the estimated fair value of our investments  various methodologies  assumptions and inputs are utilized 
when quoted prices in active markets are not available  the determination of estimated fair value is based on market standard valuation methodologies  giving priority to observable inputs 
the market standard valuation methodologies utilized include discounted cash flow methodologies  matrix pricing or other similar techniques 

table of contents the inputs to these market standard valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to interest rates  credit standing of the issuer or counterparty  industry sector of the issuer  coupon rate  call provisions  sinking fund requirements  maturity  estimated duration and management s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated future cash flows 
accordingly  the estimated fair values are based on available market information and management s judgments about financial instruments 
the significant inputs to the market standard valuation methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
such observable inputs include benchmarking prices for similar assets in active  liquid markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and spreads in the market 
when observable inputs are not available  the market standard valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value of certain types of securities that trade infrequently  and therefore have little or no price transparency  rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
these unobservable inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or estimation  and cannot be supported by reference to market activity 
even though unobservable  these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such securities 
the estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale and securitized reverse residential mortgage loans is determined based on observable pricing for securities backed by similar types of loans  adjusted to convert the securities prices to loan prices  or from independent broker quotations  which is intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from third parties 
certain other mortgage loans that were previously designated as held for investment  but now are designated as held for sale  are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value  or for collateral dependent loans  estimated fair value of the collateral less expected disposition costs determined on an individual loan basis 
for these loans  estimated fair value is determined using independent broker quotations  or values provided by independent valuation specialists  or when the loan is in foreclosure or otherwise collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral is estimated using internal models 
financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity 
our ability to sell securities  or the price ultimately realized for these securities  depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain securities 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the estimated fair value of our investments 
investment impairments one of the significant estimates related to available for sale afs securities is our impairment evaluation 
the assessment of whether an other than temporary impairment otti occurred is based on our case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value on a security by security basis 
our review of each fixed maturity and equity security for otti includes an analysis of gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and or age of gross unrealized loss 
an extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments 
accordingly  such an unrealized loss position may not impact our evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected 
in contrast  for certain equity securities  greater weight and consideration are given to a decline in estimated fair value and the likelihood such estimated fair value decline will recover 

table of contents additionally  we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
factors we consider in the otti evaluation process are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on the remaining invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our determination of the amount of allowances and impairments 
derivatives the determination of estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives  when quoted market values are not available  is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments 
derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  financial indices  credit spreads  default risk  nonperformance risk  volatility  liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on significant inputs into the over the counter otc derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment 
we issue certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits  which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product  with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains losses 
the estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees 
the projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions  including expectations concerning policyholder behavior 
a risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk free rates 
the valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non capital market inputs 
the nonperformance risk adjustment  which is captured as a spread over the risk free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability  is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for metlife  inc s debt  including related credit default swaps 
these observable spreads are then adjusted  as necessary  to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to metlife  inc risk margins are established to capture the non capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions 
the establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment  including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees 
the table below illustrates the impact that a range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads would have on our consolidated balance sheet  excluding the effect of income tax  related to the embedded derivative valuation on certain variable annuity products measured at estimated fair value 
however  these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables  such as equity price levels and market volatility  that can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values 
therefore  the table does not necessarily reflect the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statements under the credit spread variance scenarios presented below 
in determining the ranges  we have considered current market conditions  as well as the market level of spreads that can reasonably be anticipated over the near term 
the ranges do not reflect extreme market conditions experienced during the recent financial crisis as we do not consider those to be reasonably likely events in the near future 

table of contents changes in balance sheet carrying value at december  policyholder account balances dac and voba in millions increase in our credit spread as reported decrease in our credit spread the accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice 
if it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied  reported net income could be materially affected 
assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income 
variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets 
market conditions including  but not limited to  changes in interest rates  equity indices  market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates  changes in our nonperformance risk  variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior  mortality and risk margins related to non capital market inputs  may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income 
if interpretations change  there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income 
additionally  we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs 
the value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by us with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer 
because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and  thus are not accounted for at fair value  significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in such instances  the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business acquisition 
the key inputs  judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected operating earnings  current book value  the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business  long term growth rates  comparative market multiples  the account value of in force business  projections of new and renewal business  as well as margins on such business  the level of interest rates  credit spreads  equity market levels  and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit 
the estimated fair values of the retail annuities and retail life other reporting units are particularly sensitive to interest rate and equity market levels 

table of contents we performed the annual goodwill impairment test on our retail annuities reporting unit using both the market multiple and discounted cash flow valuation approaches 
results for both approaches indicated that the fair value of the retail annuities reporting unit was below its carrying value 
as a result  an actuarial appraisal  which estimates the net worth of the reporting unit  the value of existing business and the value of new business  was performed 
this appraisal resulted in a fair value of the retail annuities reporting unit that was less than the carrying value  indicating a potential for goodwill impairment 
the actuarial appraisal reflected the expected market impact to a buyer of changes in the regulatory environment  continued low interest rates for an extended period of time  and other market and economic factors 
specifically  in july  the department of financial services initiated an inquiry into the use of captive or off shore reinsurers  strategies many market participants have used for capital efficiency on variable annuity products  the national association of insurance commissioners naic has also been studying the use of captives 
additionally  in the third quarter of  the federal reserve announced that it anticipated that low interest rates were likely to be warranted at least through mid  extending the time horizon from previous announcements and moody s changed its outlook for the us life insurance industry to negative from stable  and stated that it expects interest rates to remain in the low single digits for the next few years 
as a result  we performed step of the goodwill impairment process  which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
this analysis indicated that the recorded goodwill associated with this reporting unit was not recoverable 
therefore  we recorded a non cash charge of billion billion  net of income tax for the impairment of the entire goodwill balance that is reported in goodwill impairment in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended december  we performed the annual goodwill impairment test on our retail life reporting unit which passed both the market multiple valuation and the discounted cash flow valuation approaches 
the fair value of the reporting unit  calculated based on application of the discounted cash flow valuation approach  exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
if we had assumed that the discount rate was basis points higher than the discount rate used  the fair value of the retail life reporting unit would have been less than the carrying value by approximately 
in addition  we performed the annual goodwill impairment tests on our other reporting units using a market multiple and or the discounted cash flow approach and concluded that the fair values of all such reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and  therefore  goodwill was not impaired 
as anticipated  in the third quarter of  we continued to realign certain products and businesses among our existing segments 
as a result  beginning in the third quarter of  the retail life reporting unit was integrated with other products and businesses  including the retail property casualty business  which is less sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the amount of goodwill allocated to the retail life other reporting unit was approximately billion as of december  as a result of the realignment during the third quarter  we performed an analysis to identify all reporting units under the revised structure 
based on a qualitative assessment performed  we concluded that there were no indicators of a scenario in which it was more likely than not that any reporting units had a carrying value that exceeded fair value  and thus  no further impairment analysis was performed 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate potential triggering events that may affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment exists 
we apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units 
the valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change 
estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management s reasonable expectation regarding future developments 
these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will  in all likelihood  differ in some respects from actual future results 
declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our goodwill 

table of contents employee benefit plans certain subsidiaries of metlife  inc sponsor and or administer various plans that provide defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits covering eligible employees and sales representatives 
the calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates  as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirements  withdrawal rates and mortality 
in consultation with external actuarial firms  we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets  currently available market and industry data  and expected benefit payout streams 
we determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation  real return  term premium  credit spreads  equity risk premium and capital appreciation  as well as expenses  expected asset manager performance  asset weights and the effect of rebalancing 
given the amount of plan assets as of december   the beginning of the measurement year  if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was basis points higher or basis points lower than the rates we assumed  the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of million and an increase of million  respectively  in this considers only changes in our assumed long term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the year  without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long term rate of return 
we determine the discount rates used to value the pension and postretirement obligations  based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds 
given our pension and postretirement obligations as of december   the beginning of the measurement year  if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and postretirement benefit plans that was basis points higher or basis points lower than the rates we assumed  the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of million and an increase of million  respectively  in this considers only changes in our assumed discount rates without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate 
the assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to  among other factors  changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and liquidity 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans 
income taxes we provide for federal  state and foreign income taxes currently payable  as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions 
these tax laws are complex and are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
we must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions  both domestic and foreign 

table of contents the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction 
valuation allowances are established when management determines  based on available information  that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
factors in management s determination include the performance of the business and its ability to generate capital gains 
significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established  as well as the amount of such allowances 
when making such determination  consideration is given to  among other things  the following i future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  iii taxable income in prior carryback years  and iv tax planning strategies 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon audit 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in the financial statements 
we may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change  or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances 
additionally  future events  such as changes in tax laws  tax regulations  or interpretations of such laws or regulations  could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate 
any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our income taxes 
litigation contingencies we are a party to a number of legal actions and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations 
given the inherent unpredictability of these matters  it is difficult to estimate the impact on our financial position 
liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities related to certain lawsuits  including our asbestos related liability  are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates 
the data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate our asbestos related liability include the number of future claims  the cost to resolve claims  the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims  the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed  the possible impact of tort reform efforts  the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against us when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known  and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts 
on a quarterly and annual basis  we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation  regulatory investigations and litigation related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations  including asbestos related cases  or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods

we manage our investment portfolio using disciplined alm principles  focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities 
our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount  while optimizing risk adjusted net investment income and risk adjusted total return 
our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments  with over of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans 
these securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities 
other invested asset classes including  but not limited to  equity securities  other limited partnership interests and real estate and real estate joint ventures  provide additional diversification and opportunity for long term yield enhancement in addition to supporting the cash flow and duration objectives of our investment portfolio 
we also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio to hedge certain risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity market levels 
additional considerations for our investment portfolio include current and expected market conditions and expectations for changes within our specific mix of products and business segments 
in addition  the general account investment portfolio includes  within fair value option fvo and trading securities  contractholder directed investments supporting unit linked variable annuity type liabilities  which do not qualify as separate account assets 
the returns on these contractholder directed investments  which can vary significantly period to period  include changes in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase  inure to contractholders and are offset in earnings by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances pabs through interest credited to policyholder account balances 
the composition of the investment portfolio of each business segment is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities  causing certain portfolios to be shorter in duration and others to be longer in duration 
accordingly  certain portfolios are more heavily weighted in longer duration  higher yielding fixed maturity securities  or certain sub sectors of fixed maturity securities  than other portfolios 
investments are purchased to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses 
however  net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences  including changes in market factors such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  credit spreads and equity markets  counterparty specific factors such as financial performance  credit rating and collateral valuation  and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing 
changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold 
we use freestanding interest rate  equity  credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities 
certain of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges  which reduce volatility in earnings 
for those hedges not designated as accounting hedges  changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains losses generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged 
certain variable annuity products with minimum benefit guarantees contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract  with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains losses 
the company uses freestanding derivatives to hedge the market risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees 
the valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment  which is unhedged and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains losses but does not have an economic impact on the company

the income tax benefit associated with this charge is limited to million on the associated tax goodwill 
as more fully described in non gaap and other financial disclosures  we use operating earnings  which does not equate to income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  as determined in accordance with gaap  to analyze our performance  evaluate segment performance  and allocate resources 
we believe that the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders  as we measure it for management purposes  enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business

long term and mid term interest rates decreased more in the current period than in the prior period and contributed to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and unfavorable changes in our embedded derivatives 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed to an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives and a favorable change in our embedded derivatives 
the increase in net investment losses primarily reflects impairments on greece sovereign debt securities  intent to sell otti on other sovereign debt securities due to the repositioning of the alico portfolio into longer duration and higher yielding investments  intent to sell otti related to the divested businesses  and lower net gains on sales of fixed maturity and equity securities 
these losses were partially offset by net gains on the sales of certain real estate investments and reductions in the mortgage valuation allowance reflecting improving real estate market fundamentals

higher policy fee income  stronger investment results and favorable claims experience were the primary drivers of the increase in operating earnings 
in addition  the prior year included a million charge in connection with our use of the us social security administration s death master file 
these positive impacts on operating earnings were partially offset by a million charge taken in the first quarter of representing a multi state examination payment related to unclaimed property and our use of the us social security administration s death master file to identify potential life insurance claims  as well as the expected acceleration of benefit payments to policyholders under the settlements 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a million negative impact on results compared to the prior year 
we benefited from strong sales  as well as growth and higher persistency in our business across many of our products 
in our retail segment  we implemented extensive changes to product pricing and variable annuity guarantee features which resulted in a significant decrease in variable annuity sales 
however  as a result of stronger sales of variable annuities in  we experienced growth in both our average separate account assets and our investment portfolio 
the growth in the average separate account assets generated higher policy fee income of million 
the growth in our investment portfolio generated higher net investment income of million 
since many of our products are interest spread based  the increase in net investment income was partially offset by a million increase in interest credited expense  most notably in the corporate benefit funding and asia segments 
the decline in variable annuity sales also resulted in a decrease in commissions  despite higher sales from our international businesses  which was partially offset by a decrease in related dac capitalization which  combined  resulted in a million increase to operating earnings 
in addition  other non variable expenses increased million and our annuity business growth in was the primary driver of 
table of contents higher dac amortization of million in the current year 
higher premiums partially offset by higher policyholder benefits in our international segments improved operating earnings by million 
the low interest rate environment continued to result in lower interest credited expense as we set interest credited rates lower on both new business  as well as on certain in force business with rate resets that are contractually tied to external indices or contain discretionary rate reset provisions 
the improving equity markets resulted in lower dac amortization and higher fee income in our annuity business 
improved investment yields  excluding the divested businesses  were driven by the repositioning of the japan portfolio  growth in higher yielding portfolios in the asia and emea segments  the impact of inflation indexed investments in the latin america segment  higher derivatives income primarily from interest rate floors and interest rate swaps entered into prior to the onset of the low interest rate environment  and increased private equity income from improving equity markets 
these improvements were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the low interest rate environment on our fixed income investments 
changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a million increase in operating earnings 
lower severity of property casualty catastrophe claims in the current year increased operating earnings by million as a result of severe storm activity in the prior year  which was greater than the impact of severe storm activity in the current year  primarily the result of superstorm sandy 
less favorable mortality results in our group  voluntary worksite benefits segment and unfavorable mortality in our asia and corporate benefit funding segments  was partially offset by favorable mortality in our retail segment 
in addition  claims experience varied across our products with a net favorable result driven by a decrease in claims in our group  voluntary worksite benefits segment 
the combined impact of mortality and claims experience decreased operating earnings by million 
liability and dac refinements in both periods  primarily from our retail  asia and group  voluntary worksite benefits segments  resulted in a million net increase in operating earnings 
in addition  the prior period included million of expenses incurred related to a liquidation plan filed by the department of financial services for elny and million of insurance claims and operating expenses related to the march earthquake and tsunami in japan 
the current period included million of employee related and other costs associated with the company s enterprise wide strategic initiative and a million impairment charge on an intangible asset related to a previously acquired dental business 
the company benefited from the impact of certain permanent tax differences  including non taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing 
as a result  our effective tax rates differ from the us statutory rate of 
in  we benefited primarily from higher utilization of tax preferenced investments  which improved operating earnings by million over the prior year 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  unless otherwise stated  all amounts discussed below are net of income tax 
the increase in operating earnings reflects the impact of the alico acquisition with the corresponding effects on each of our financial statement lines in latin america  asia and emea 
further trends and matters impacting our business and the comparison to results are discussed below 
positive results from strong sales in were offset by losses from severe weather and the impact of the low interest rate environment 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a slightly positive impact on results compared to in  we benefited from strong sales as well as growth and higher persistency in our business  across many of our products 
as a result  we experienced growth in our investment portfolio  as well as our average separate account assets  generating both higher net investment income of million and higher policy fee income of million 
since many of our products are interest spread based  the growth in our individual life  ltc and 
table of contents structured settlement businesses also resulted in a million increase in interest credited expenses 
these increased sales also generated an increase in commission and other volume related expenses of million  which was largely offset by an increase of million in related dac capitalization 
dac amortization also increased million 
in addition  other non variable expenses increased million due to growth in our existing businesses 
we review and update our long term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance related liabilities and dac annually  which may result in changes and are recorded in the fourth quarter each year 
this annual update  along with other reserve refinements  contributed to a net operating earnings increase of million  mainly in the universal life block of business 
in addition  to better align with hedged risks  certain elements of our variable annuity hedging program that were previously recorded in net investment income were recorded in net derivative gains losses beginning in which resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced a reduction in our dividend scale related to our closed block 
the impact of this action increased operating earnings by million 
severe weather during was the primary driver of our unfavorable claims experience in our property casualty business  which decreased operating earnings by million 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we incurred a million charge to increase reserves in connection with our use of the us social security administration s death master file  impacting primarily group  voluntary worksite benefits 
these events overshadowed positive results of million  driven by favorable claims experience in our dental and disability businesses and strong mortality gains in our group life business 
market factors  specifically the current low interest rate environment  continued to be a challenge during also in  equity markets remained relatively flat compared to much stronger equity market performance 
excluding the impact of divested businesses  investment yields were negatively impacted by the current low interest rate environment and lower returns in the equity markets  partially offset by improving real estate markets  resulting in a million decrease in net investment income 
partially offsetting this decrease was a million improvement in operating earnings  primarily driven by lower average crediting rates on our annuity and funding agreement businesses 
the lower average crediting rates continue to reflect the lower investment returns available in the marketplace 
also contributing to the decrease in interest credited is the impact from derivatives that are used to hedge certain liabilities in our funding agreement business 
interest expense on debt increased million primarily as a result of debt issued in the third and fourth quarters of in connection with the alico acquisition 
the company incurred million of expenses related to a liquidation plan filed by the department of financial services for elny in the third quarter of the company also benefited from higher tax credits in of million over primarily due to million of charges in related to the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of together  the health care act 
the health care act reduced the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of any medicare part d subsidy received beginning in because the deductibility of future retiree health care costs was reflected in our financial statements  the entire future impact of this change in law was required to be recorded as a charge in the first quarter of  when the legislation was enacted 
the company benefits from the impact of certain permanent tax differences  including non taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing

we implemented extensive changes to product pricing and variable annuity guarantee features as we continued to manage sales volume  focusing on pricing discipline and risk management in this challenging economic environment 
these actions resulted in a net decrease in the overall segment sales in the current year  most notably a billion  or decrease in variable annuity sales which were billion in consistent with the decrease in sales  retail life and annuity net flows were down billion compared to the prior year 
stronger sales of variable annuities in the prior year increased our average separate account assets and  as a result  generated higher asset based fee revenues  partially offset by increases in non deferrable expenses  increases in guaranteed minimum death benefit liabilities and higher dac amortization related to the strong prior year sales 
positive net flows from life products  as well as higher allocated equity for annuities increased net investment income 
these positive net flows also contributed to higher dac amortization 
business growth  mainly in our traditional life products  generated higher interest credited expense  however  this was somewhat mitigated by a decrease in interest credited on deferred annuities where normal surrenders and withdrawals were greater than sales for the year  resulting in negative net flows 
in our property casualty business  the increase in average premium per policy in both auto and homeowners businesses improved operating earnings  but was partially offset by a decrease in exposures 
we experienced a decrease in exposures as the negative impact from lower premiums exceeded the positive impact from lower claims 
the net impact of these items resulted in a million increase in operating earnings 
the improving equity market resulted in higher fee income from increased separate account balances  a decrease in variable annuity guaranteed minimum death benefit liabilities and lower dac amortization 
in addition  the low interest rate environment continued to result in lower interest credited expense  as we reduced 
table of contents interest credited rates on contracts with discretionary rate reset provisions 
higher derivatives income from interest rate floors purchased prior to the onset of the low interest rate environment and higher returns on our private equity investments more than offset the decrease in yields on other invested asset classes 
the net impact of these items resulted in a million increase in operating earnings 
in our property casualty business  catastrophe related losses decreased million compared to mainly due to the severe storm activity during the second and third quarters of  which were greater than the impact of severe storm activity in the fourth quarter of  primarily the result of superstorm sandy 
current year non catastrophe claim costs decreased million as a result of lower claim frequencies in our homeowners businesses 
higher severities in both our auto and homeowners business resulted in a million increase in claims 
the impact of this can be seen in the favorable change in the combined ratio  including catastrophes  to in from in the combined ratio  excluding catastrophes  was in  compared to in the prior year 
favorable mortality experience in the traditional life business was partially offset by unfavorable mortality experience in the variable and universal life and income annuities businesses resulting in a million increase in operating earnings 
the current year results included a charge of million for the expected acceleration of benefit payments to policyholders under a multi state examination related to unclaimed property 
the prior year results included a charge of million  in connection with the company s use of the us social security administration s death master file 
on an annual basis  we review and update our long term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance related liabilities and dac 
this annual update resulted in a net operating earnings increase of million 
this favorable adjustment was primarily related to dac unlockings in the variable annuities business  partially offset by an increase in the liability for the secondary guarantees in the universal life business 
in addition to our annual updates  certain insurance related liability and dac refinements were recorded in both the current and prior year 
the net impact of these refinements was a million increase in operating earnings 
in our closed block  the impact of the dividend scale reduction  which was announced in the fourth quarter of  increased operating earnings by million  net of dac amortization 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  unless otherwise stated  all amounts discussed below are net of income tax 
in  operating results for our property casualty business were negatively impacted by severe weather  including a record number of tornadoes in the second quarter and hurricane irene in the third quarter 
overall sales increased  largely driven by a increase in annuity sales  which grew to billion  mainly from strong growth in variable annuities across all distribution channels 
however  the favorable impact of our sales growth was dampened by the sustained low interest rate environment 
variable annuity product sales increased primarily due to the introduction of a new higher benefit  lower risk variable annuity rider and changes in competitors offerings which  we believe  made our products more attractive 
we launched several changes to our annuity products and riders that are expected to reduce sales volumes in  as we manage sales to strike the right balance among growth  profitability and risk 
retail life and annuity net flows were billion  billion higher than sales growth in variable annuities and in our variable and universal life products  along with higher persistency in  resulted in an increase in operating earnings of million 
the growth in variable products increased average separate account assets and  as a result  generated higher asset based fee revenue on the separate account assets  partially offset by increases in dac amortization 
this  coupled with the impact of positive net flows on invested assets  increased net investment income 
partially offsetting the positive impact from the strong sales of variable annuities  were increases in variable expenses  net of dac capitalization 
in addition  this business growth generated higher interest credited on policyholder account balances as well as on certain future policyholder benefits 
the aforementioned increase in our variable and universal life products was mainly driven by our launch of a new product in the current year  coupled with ongoing organic growth in the 
table of contents business 
the expected run off of the traditional life closed block offset this growth 
while property casualty sales declined  due to sluggish housing and new automobile markets  an increase in average premium per policy in both our homeowners and auto businesses improved operating earnings by million 
this was partially offset by a million negative impact to operating earnings due to the decline in exposures  the negative impact from lower premiums exceeded the positive impact from lower claims 
this negative impact was coupled with a million increase in expenses  mainly higher commissions  resulting from the increase in average premium per policy 
changes in interest rates and equity markets can significantly impact our earnings

these changes in interest rates and equity markets reduced operating earnings by million  including the related acceleration of dac amortization 
lower investment returns in all products and higher interest crediting expense in the life products were partially offset by lower average interest crediting rates on annuity fixed rate funds

our group term life and disability businesses grew as a result of new sales  and our dental business continued to benefit from strong enrollments and renewals  as well as premiums associated with the implementation of a new dental contract from a large customer that began in the second quarter of although we have discontinued selling our ltc product  we continue to collect premiums and administer the existing block of business  contributing to asset growth in the segment 
although policy sales for both auto and homeowners decreased as compared to the prior year  the impact of an increase in the average premium for new policies sold more than offset the decline in policy sales 
lower severity of property casualty catastrophe claims in the current year increased operating earnings by million  mainly as a result of severe storm activity in the second and third quarters of  which were greater than the impact of severe storm activity in the fourth quarter of  primarily the result of superstorm sandy 
while property casualty non catastrophe claims experience was relatively flat year over year  an increase in severity of million  was largely offset by lower claims frequency of million 
a decrease in claims in our dental  disability and accidental death and dismemberment businesses resulted in a million increase to operating earnings 
lower utilization in our dental business  as well as lower incidence and approvals in our disability business drove this improvement in operating earnings 
a decrease in operating earnings of million resulted from less favorable mortality experience in our life businesses  mainly due to very strong mortality experience in the prior year  which was partially offset by the favorable net impact of reserve refinements of million that occurred in both years 
the mortality ratio for our life businesses has returned to a more historically representative level of in  as adjusted for the aforementioned favorable reserve refinements  from a near record low of in the prior year  as adjusted for a prior year charge related to our use of the us social security administration s death master file

policy sales in our property casualty business decreased as the housing and new automobile sales markets remained sluggish 
however  average premium per policy increased for both our homeowners and auto policies and we benefited from additional growth in exposures over the prior period 
for our life and health businesses  sustained high levels of unemployment and a challenging pricing environment continued to depress growth 
our dental business benefited from higher enrollment and certain pricing actions  but this was more than offset by a decline in revenues from our disability business 
this reduction was mainly due to net customer cancellations and lower covered lives 
our ltc revenues were flat period over period  consistent with the discontinuance of the sale of this coverage at the end of although revenues have declined from the prior year  current year premiums and deposits resulted in an increase in our average invested assets  which contributed million to operating earnings

sales in our structured settlement business were strong as we remain very competitive in the marketplace 
premiums for these businesses were almost entirely offset by the related change in policyholder benefits 
however  current year premiums  deposits  funding agreement issuances  an increase in allocated equity  and the expansion of our securities lending program  all contributed to the growth of our average invested assets  which led to an increase in net investment income

effects of inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates 
an increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways 
during inflationary periods  the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses 
inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials  potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices 
inflation could also lead to increased costs for losses and loss adjustment expenses in certain of our businesses  which could require us to adjust our pricing to reflect our expectations for future inflation 
prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally  and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy  which could constrain overall economic activity  inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities

changes in market interest rates can result from governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond our control  and will impact the net unrealized gain or loss position of our fixed income investment portfolio and the rates of return we receive on both new funds invested and reinvestment of existing funds 
liquidity risk  relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments  in times of strained market conditions  market valuation risk  relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads 
a widening of credit spreads will adversely impact the net unrealized gain loss position of the fixed income investment portfolio  will increase losses associated with credit based non qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure  and  if credit spreads widen significantly or for an extended period of time  will likely result in higher other than temporary impairments otti 
credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with purchases of fixed maturity securities and will favorably impact the net unrealized gain loss position of the fixed income investment portfolio 
currency risk  relating to the variability in currency exchange rates for foreign denominated investments 
this risk relates to potential decreases in estimated fair value and income resulting from a strengthening or weakening in currency exchange rates versus the us dollar 
in general  the weakening of foreign currencies versus the us dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our foreign denominated investments  and

these strategies include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile through product design  such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges 
we also manage interest rate risk through proactive monitoring and management of certain non guaranteed elements of its products  such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments 
in addition to hedging with foreign currency derivatives  we manage currency risk by matching much of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets  thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation 
we also use certain derivatives in the management of credit  interest rate  and equity market risks 
we use purchased credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk in our investment portfolio 
generally  we purchase credit protection by entering into credit default swaps referencing the issuers of specific assets we own 
in certain cases  basis risk exists between these credit default swaps and the specific assets we own 
for example  we may purchase credit protection on a macro basis to reduce exposure to specific industries or other portfolio concentrations 
in such instances  the referenced entities and obligations under the credit default swaps may not be identical to the individual obligors or securities in our investment portfolio 
in addition  our purchased credit default swaps may have shorter tenors than the underlying investments they are hedging 
however  we dynamically hedge this risk through the rebalancing and rollover of its credit default swaps at their most liquid tenors 
we believe that our purchased credit default swaps serve as effective legal and economic hedges of our credit exposure 
we generally enter into market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts 
payout under such contracts is triggered by certain credit events experienced by the referenced entities 
for credit default swaps covering north american corporate issuers  credit events typically include bankruptcy and failure to pay on borrowed money 
for european corporate issuers  credit events typically also include involuntary restructuring 
with respect to credit default contracts on western european sovereign debt  credit events typically include failure to pay debt obligations  repudiation  moratorium  or involuntary restructuring 
in each case  payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the credit derivatives determinations committee of the international swaps and derivatives association deems that a credit event has occurred 
current environment the global economy and markets continue to be affected by significant stress and volatility  which has adversely affected the financial services sector in particular and global capital markets 
as a company with significant operations in the us  we are affected by the monetary policy of the federal reserve 
the federal reserve board has taken a number of policy actions in recent years to spur economic activity  by keeping interest rates low and  more recently  through its asset purchase programs 
see industry trends impact of sustained low interest rate environment for information on actions taken by the federal reserve board and central banks around the world to support the economic recovery 
see industry trends financial and economic environment for information on actions taken by japan s central government and the bank of japan to end deflation and achieve sustainable economic growth in japan 
the federal reserve may take further actions to influence interest rates in the future  which may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk bearing investments and may adversely impact the level of product sales 

table of contents europe s perimeter region 
during  concerns about the economic conditions  capital markets and the solvency of certain european union member states  including europe s perimeter region and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to their sovereign debt continued to create market volatility 
this market volatility will likely continue to affect the performance of various asset classes in  and perhaps longer  until there is an ultimate resolution of these european union sovereign debt related concerns 
as a result of concerns about the ability of europe s perimeter region  to service its sovereign debt  certain countries have experienced credit ratings downgrades 
despite official financial support programs for the most stressed governments in europe s perimeter region  including the march exchange of billion of greece domestic law sovereign debt with private sector holders in exchange for a package of four new securities issued by greece and the public sector supported european financial stability facility  concerns about sovereign debt sustainability has expanded to other european union member states 
as a result  in late and early  several other european union member states have experienced credit ratings downgrades or have had their credit ratings outlook changed to negative 
as summarized below  at december  and  we did not have significant exposure to the sovereign debt of europe s perimeter region

in the european region  we have proactively mitigated risk in both direct and indirect exposures by investing in a diversified portfolio of high quality investments with a focus on the higher rated countries  reducing our holdings through sales of financial services securities during and and sales of europe s perimeter region sovereign debt in  and by purchasing certain single name credit default protection in and our sales of financial services securities were focused on institutions with exposure to europe s perimeter region  lower preference capital structure instruments  and larger positions

included within fixed maturity and equity securities were billion and billion of perpetual securities  at estimated fair value  at december  and  respectively 
upon acquisition  we classify perpetual securities that have attributes of both debt and equity as fixed maturity securities if the securities have an interest rate step up feature which  when combined with other qualitative factors  indicates that the securities have more debt like characteristics  while those with more equity like characteristics are classified as equity securities 
many of such securities  commonly referred to as perpetual hybrid securities have been issued by non us financial institutions that are accorded the highest two capital treatment categories by their respective regulatory bodies ie core capital  or tier capital and perpetual deferrable securities  or upper tier capital 

table of contents included within fixed maturity securities were billion and billion of redeemable preferred stock at estimated fair value at december  and  respectively 
these securities  which have stated maturity dates and cumulative interest deferral features  are commonly referred to as capital securities  and are primarily issued by us financial institutions 
valuation of securities 
we are responsible for the determination of estimated fair value of our investments 
we determine the estimated fair value of publicly traded securities after considering one of three primary sources of information quoted market prices in active markets  independent pricing services  or independent broker quotations  whereas for privately placed securities  estimated fair value is determined after considering one of three primary sources of information market standard internal matrix pricing  market standard internal discounted cash flow techniques  or independent pricing services after we determine their use of available observable market data 
for publicly traded securities  the number of quotations obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument 
generally  we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities  but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy 
independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on data about market transactions and inputs from multiple pricing sources that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the types of market standard valuation methodologies utilized and key assumptions and observable inputs used in applying these standard valuation methodologies 
when a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service  management will value the security primarily using market standard internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques  and non binding quotations from independent brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities 
independent non binding broker quotations utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market data 
as shown in the following section  less than of our fixed maturity securities were valued using non binding quotations from independent brokers at december  senior management  independent of the trading and investing functions  is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies  including reviewing and approving new transaction types and markets  for ensuring that observable market prices and market based parameters are used for valuation  wherever possible  and for determining that judgmental valuation adjustments  when applied  are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time 
we review our valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and revise when necessary based on changing market conditions 
we gain assurance on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions  valuation methodologies and compliance with accounting standards for fair value determination through our controls designed to ensure that the financial assets and financial liabilities are appropriately valued and represent an exit price 
we utilize several controls  including certain monthly controls  which include  but are not limited to  analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns  comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates  comparing fair value estimates to management s knowledge of the current market  reviewing the bid ask spreads to assess activity  comparing prices from multiple pricing sources  when available  reviewing independent auditor reports regarding the controls over valuation of securities employed by independent pricing services  and ongoing due diligence to confirm that independent pricing services use market based parameters for valuation 
we determine the observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data 
we also apply a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value 
if we conclude that prices received from independent pricing services are not reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value  we will seek independent non binding broker quotes or use an internally developed valuation to override these prices 
our internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value  which reflect our estimates of liquidity and nonperformance risks  compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services  did not produce material differences for the vast majority of our fixed maturity securities portfolio 
this is  in part  because our internal estimates of liquidity and nonperformance risks are generally based on available market evidence and estimates used by other 
table of contents market participants 
in the absence of such market based evidence  management s best estimate is used 
as a result  we generally use the price provided by the independent pricing service under our normal pricing protocol 
we have reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of its securities 
based on the results of this review and investment class analyses  each instrument is categorized as level  or based on the lowest level significant input to its valuation

fixed maturity securities credit quality ratings 
the securities valuation office of the naic evaluates the fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called naic designations 
if no rating is available from the naic  then as permitted by the naic  an internally developed rating is used 
the naic ratings are generally similar to the credit quality designations of the nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations nrsro for marketable fixed maturity securities  called rating agency designations  except for certain structured securities as described below 
rating agency designations are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the naic credit rating provider list  including moody s  s p  fitch ratings fitch  dominion bond rating service  am best company  kroll bond rating agency and realpoint  llc 
if no rating is available from a rating agency  then an internally developed rating is used 
the naic has adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities comprised of non agency rmbs  commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and abs 
the naic s objective with the revised rating methodologies for these structured securities was to increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses  and to use the improved assessment to determine a more appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities 
the revised methodologies reduce regulatory reliance on rating agencies and allow for greater regulatory input into the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from structured securities 
we apply the revised naic rating methodologies to structured securities held by metlife  inc s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the naic statutory basis of accounting 
the naic s present methodology is to evaluate structured securities held by insurers using the revised naic rating methodologies on an annual basis 
if such insurance subsidiaries of our acquired structured securities that have not been previously evaluated by the naic  but are expected to be evaluated by the naic in the upcoming annual review  an internally developed rating is used until a final rating becomes available

credit related impairments of fixed maturity securities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
explanations of changes in fixed maturity and equity securities impairments are as follows year ended december  compared to the year ended december  overall otti losses recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities were million for the current year as compared to billion in the prior year 
the most significant decrease in the current period  as compared to the prior period  was in foreign government securities primarily attributable to prior year impairments on greece sovereign debt securities of million as a result of the reduction in the expected recoverable amount see investments current environment and intent to sell fixed maturity security otti on other sovereign debt securities due to the repositioning of the acquired alico portfolio into longer duration and higher yielding investments  resulting in total sovereign debt securities impairments of million recognized in in addition  intent to sell otti related to the divested businesses of million were recognized in primarily concentrated in the rmbs sector  while utility industry impairments within us and foreign corporate securities increased million in the current year 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  overall otti losses recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities were billion for the current year as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in otti losses on fixed maturity and equity securities primarily reflects impairments on greece sovereign debt securities  repositioning of the acquired alico portfolio  and impairments related to divested businesses  as discussed above 
these increased impairments were partially offset by decreased impairments in the cmbs  abs and corporate sectors  reflecting improving economic fundamentals 
future impairments 
future ottis will depend primarily on economic fundamentals  issuer performance including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected  changes in credit ratings  changes in collateral valuation  changes in interest rates and changes in credit spreads 
if economic fundamentals or certain of the above factors deteriorate  additional ottis may be incurred in upcoming periods

we monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis  including reviewing loans that are restructured  potentially delinquent  and delinquent or under foreclosure 
these loan classifications are consistent with those used in industry practice 
we define restructured mortgage loans as loans in which we  for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties  grant a concession to the debtor that we would not otherwise consider 
we define potentially delinquent loans as loans that  in management s opinion  have a high probability of becoming delinquent in the near term 
we define delinquent mortgage loans consistent with industry practice  when interest and principal payments are past due as follows commercial and residential days or more and agricultural days or more 
we define mortgage loans under foreclosure as loans in which foreclosure proceedings have formally commenced

mortgage loan credit quality monitoring process commercial and agricultural mortgage loans 
we review all commercial mortgage loans on an ongoing basis 
these reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll  lease rollover analysis  property inspections  market analysis  estimated valuations of the underlying collateral  loan to value ratios  debt service coverage ratios  and tenant creditworthiness 
the monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans  which include those that are classified as restructured  potentially delinquent  delinquent or in foreclosure  as well as loans with higher loan to value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios 
the monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar  with a focus on higher risk loans  such as loans with higher loan to value ratios  including reviews on a geographic and property type basis 
loan to value ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans 
loan to value ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of 
table of contents agricultural mortgage loans 
loan to value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
a loan to value ratio greater than indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value 
a loan to value ratio of less than indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount 
generally  the higher the loan to value ratio  the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss 
the debt service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan 
generally  the lower the debt service coverage ratio  the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss 
for our commercial mortgage loans  our average loan to value ratio was and at december  and  respectively  and our average debt service coverage ratio was x at december   as compared to x at december  the commercial mortgage loan debt service coverage ratio and loan to value ratio  as well as the values utilized in calculating these ratios  are updated annually  on a rolling basis  with a portion of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio updated each quarter 
for our agricultural mortgage loans  our average loan to value ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
the values utilized in calculating the agricultural mortgage loan loan to value ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural loan portfolio and are routinely updated 
mortgage loan valuation allowances 
our valuation allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a property specific or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future loss  as well as for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property specific or market specific risk has not been identified  but for which we expect to incur a loss 
accordingly  a valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated probable credit losses 
the determination of the amount of  and additions or decreases to  valuation allowances is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with its loan portfolios 
such evaluations and assessments are based upon several factors  including our experience for loan losses  defaults and loss severity  and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics 
these evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
we update our evaluations regularly  which can cause the valuation allowances to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised 
negative credit migration  including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans  will result in an increase in the valuation allowance 
positive credit migration  including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans  will result in a decrease in the valuation allowance

fair value hierarchy 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy 
the valuation of level derivatives involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations of level and level derivatives 
although level inputs are unobservable  management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments and are considered appropriate given the circumstances 
the use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of level derivatives and could materially affect net income 
derivatives categorized as level at december  include interest rate swaps and interest rate forwards with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve  cancellable foreign currency swaps with unobservable currency correlation inputs  foreign currency swaps and forwards with certain unobservable inputs  including unobservable portion of the yield curve  credit default swaps priced using unobservable credit spreads  or that are priced through independent broker quotations  equity variance swaps with unobservable volatility inputs  and equity options with unobservable correlation inputs or that are priced through independent broker quotations 
at december  and  less than and  respectively  of the net derivative estimated fair value was priced through independent broker quotations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable level inputs 
level derivatives had a million gain loss recognized in net income loss for the year ended december  this loss primarily relates to certain purchased equity options that are valued using models dependent on an unobservable market correlation input and equity variance swaps that are valued using observable equity volatility data plus an unobservable equity variance spread 
the unobservable equity variance spread is calculated from a comparison between broker offered variance swap volatility and observable plain vanilla equity option volatility 
other significant inputs  which are observable  include equity index levels  equity volatility and the swap yield curve 
we validate the reasonableness of these inputs by valuing the positions using internal models and comparing the results to broker quotations 
the primary drivers of the loss during the year ended december  were significant decreases in equity volatility  both historical and implied  and increases in equity index levels  which in total accounted for approximately of the loss 
changes in the unobservable inputs accounted for approximately of the loss

credit risk 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about how we manage credit risk related to its freestanding derivatives  including the use of master netting agreements and collateral arrangements 
our policy is not to offset the fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement 
this policy applies to the recognition of derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets  and does not affect our legal right of offset 
the estimated fair value of our net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral were as follows at december  december  net derivative assets net derivative liabilities in millions estimated fair value of otc derivatives after application of master netting agreements cash collateral on otc derivatives estimated fair value of otc derivatives after application of master netting agreements and cash collateral securities collateral on otc derivatives estimated fair value of otc derivatives after application of master netting agreements and cash and securities collateral estimated fair value of exchange traded derivatives total estimated fair value of derivatives after application of master netting agreements and cash and securities collateral  includes income accruals on derivatives

policyholder liabilities we establish  and carry as liabilities  actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations or to provide for future annuity payments 
amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
for more details on policyholder liabilities  see summary of critical accounting estimates 
due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial liabilities  we cannot precisely determine the amounts that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial liabilities  and the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts  particularly when payments may not occur until well into the future 
our actuarial liabilities for future benefits are adequate to cover the ultimate benefits required to be paid to policyholders 
we periodically review our estimates of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them with our actual experience 
we revise estimates  to the extent permitted or required under gaap  if we determine that future expected experience differs from assumptions used in the development of actuarial liabilities 
we charge or credit changes in our liabilities to expenses in the period the liabilities are established or re estimated 
if the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments prove inadequate  we must increase them 
such an increase could adversely affect our earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
insurance regulators in many of the non us countries in which we operate require certain metlife entities to prepare a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements  and to submit that analysis to the regulatory authorities 
see business international regulation 
we have experienced  and will likely in the future experience  catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism  as well as turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
due to their nature  we cannot predict the incidence  timing  severity or amount of losses from catastrophes and acts of terrorism  but we make broad use of catastrophic and non catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils

see also industry trends interest rate stress scenario and variable annuity guarantees 
a discussion of future policy benefits by segment follows 
retail 
for the retail life other business  future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for traditional life and for universal and variable life insurance contracts 
in order to manage risk  we have often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on new individual life insurance policies 
the reinsurance programs are routinely evaluated and this may result in increases or decreases to existing coverage 
we have entered into various derivative positions  primarily interest rate swaps and swaptions  to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts 
for the retail annuities business  future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for life contingent income annuities  and liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits accounted for as insurance 
group  voluntary worksite benefits 
with the exception of our property casualty products  future policy benefits for our group and voluntary worksite businesses are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions  liabilities for survivor income benefit insurance  ltc policies  active life policies and premium stabilization and other contingency liabilities held under life insurance contracts 
for our property casualty products  future policy benefits include unearned premium reserves and liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses and represent the amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim frequencies  levels of severities  inflation  judicial trends  legislative changes or regulatory decisions 
assumptions are based upon our historical experience and analyses of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business  and consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs  reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
corporate benefit funding 
liabilities for this segment are primarily related to payout annuities  including pension closeouts and structured settlement annuities 
there is no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities 
as a result  a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings  however  we have employed various alm strategies  including the use of various derivative positions  primarily interest rate floors and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario 
latin america 
future policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for immediate annuities in chile  argentina and mexico and traditional life contracts mainly in brazil and mexico 
there are also reserves held for total return pass through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products in mexico

pabs in this segment are comprised of funding agreements 
interest crediting rates vary by type of contract  and can be fixed or variable 
variable interest crediting rates are generally tied to an external index  most commonly month or month london inter bank offer rate libor 
we are exposed to interest rate risks  as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk when guaranteeing payment of interest and return of principal at the contractual maturity date 
we may invest in floating rate assets or enter into receive floating interest rate swaps  also tied to external indices  as well as caps  to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates 
we also mitigate risks by implementing an alm policy and seek to hedge all foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency hedges  including cross currency swaps

corporate other 
pabs in corporate other are held for variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits assumed from a former operating joint venture in japan that are accounted for as embedded derivatives 
variable annuity guarantees we issue  directly and through assumed reinsurance  certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit ie  the benefit base less withdrawals 
in some cases  the benefit base may be increased by additional deposits  bonus amounts  accruals or optional market value resets 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
certain guarantees  including portions thereof  have insurance liabilities established that are included in future policy benefits 
guarantees accounted for in this manner include gmdb  the life contingent portion of certain guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb  and the portion of guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib that requires annuitization 
these liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns 
the scenarios are based on best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize dac 
when current estimates of future benefits exceed those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments are lower than those previously projected  liabilities will increase  resulting in a current period charge to net income 
the opposite result occurs when the current 
table of contents estimates of future benefits are lower than that previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed those previously projected 
at each reporting period  we update the actual amount of business remaining in force  which impacts expected future assessments and the projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current period charge or increase to earnings 
certain guarantees  including portions thereof  accounted for as embedded derivatives  are recorded at estimated fair value and included in pabs 
guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab  the non life contingent portion of gmwb and the portion of certain gmib that do not require annuitization 
the estimated fair values of guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees 
the projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior 
a risk neutral valuation methodology is used to project the cash flows from the guarantees under multiple capital market scenarios to determine an economic liability 
the reported estimated fair value is then determined by taking the present value of these risk free generated cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates a spread over the risk free rate to reflect our nonperformance risk and adding a risk margin 
for more information on the determination of estimated fair value  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below contains the carrying value for guarantees at future policy benefits policyholder account balances december  december  in millions americas gmdb gmib gmab gmwb asia gmdb gmab gmwb emea gmdb gmab gmwb corporate other gmdb gmab gmwb total the carrying amounts for guarantees included in pabs above include nonperformance risk adjustments of billion and billion at december  and december   respectively 
these nonperformance risk adjustments represent the impact of including a credit spread when discounting the underlying risk neutral cash flows to determine the estimated fair values 
therefore  the amount of the nonperformance risk adjustment is a function of both the size of the economic liability and credit spreads 
in certain periods  changes in the nonperformance risk adjustment can be a significant driver of net derivative gains losses 
additionally  changes in the underlying cash flows can have a greater impact on the nonperformance risk adjustment than changes in credit spreads 
the nonperformance risk adjustment does not have an economic impact on us as it cannot be monetized given the nature of these policyholder liabilities 
the change in valuation arising from the nonperformance risk adjustment is not hedged 

table of contents the carrying values of these guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  equity volatility  interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates 
carrying values are also impacted by our assumptions around mortality  separate account returns and policyholder behavior including lapse rates 
the above mentioned actuarial assumptions are updated periodically as credible experience emerges which shows variances from the current assumptions 
where appropriate  these assumptions are consistent with those used in dac amortization 
see summary of critical accounting estimates deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired 
the significant impacts to variable annuity guarantees from this year s update were primarily related to the inputs for policyholder behavior and separate account returns 
for policyholder behavior  the most significant update was to our lapse assumptions which included an update to reflect how policyholder surrender behavior has responded to in the moneyness of the guarantees 
actual experience for this update has only begun to emerge as surrender charge periods have recently started to expire 
with respect to separate account returns  which only impact liabilities included in future policy benefits  in our retail segment we have lowered our long term return assumptions from to to reflect the impact of the sustained low interest rate environment on the fixed income portion of the separate accounts 
the effect of an increase decrease by basis points in the assumed future rate of separate account returns in our retail segment is reasonably likely to result in a decrease increase in future policy benefits of approximately million 
as discussed below  we use a combination of product design  reinsurance  hedging strategies  and other risk management actions to mitigate the risks related to these benefits 
within each type of guarantee  there is a range of product offerings reflecting the changing nature of these products over time 
changes in product features and terms are in part driven by customer demand but  more importantly  reflect our risk management practices of continuously evaluating the guaranteed benefits and their associated asset liability matching 
the sections below provide further detail by total contract account value for certain of our most popular guarantees 
total contract account values include amounts not reported in the consolidated balance sheets from assumed reinsurance  contractholder directed investments which do not qualify for presentation as separate account assets  and amounts included in our general account 
gmdb we offer a range of gmdb to our contractholders 
the table below presents gmdb  by benefit type  at december  total contract account value americas corporate other in millions return of premium or five to seven year step up annual step up roll up and step up combination total total contract account value above excludes billion for contracts with no gmdb and approximately billion of total contract account value in the emea and asia regions 

table of contents based on total contract account value  less than of our gmdb included enhanced death benefits such as the annual step up or roll up and step up combination products 
we expect the above gmdb risk profile to be relatively consistent for the foreseeable future 
as part of our risk management of the gmdb business  we have been opportunistically reinsuring in force blocks  taking advantage of favorable capital market conditions 
our approach for such treaties has been to seek coverage for the enhanced gmdb  such as the annual step up and the roll up and step up combination 
these treaties tend to cover long periods until claims start running off  and are written either on a first dollar basis or with a deductible 
living benefit guarantees the table below presents our living benefit guarantees based on total contract account values at december  total contract account value americas corporate other in millions gmib gmwb non life contingent gmwb life contingent gmab total contract account value above excludes billion for contracts with no living benefit guarantees and approximately billion of total contract account value in the emea and asia regions 
in terms of total contract account value  gmib is our most significant living benefit guarantee 
our primary risk management strategy for our gmib products is our derivatives hedging program as discussed below 
additionally  we have engaged in certain reinsurance treaties covering some of our gmib business 
as part of our overall risk management approach for living benefit guarantees  we continually monitor the reinsurance markets for the right opportunity to purchase additional coverage for our gmib business 
the table below presents our gmib  by their guaranteed payout basis  at december  total contract account value in millions year setback  interest rate year setback  interest rate year setback  interest rate year mortality projection  year setback  interest rate year mortality projection  year setback  interest rate the annuitization interest rates on gmib have been decreased from to over time  partially in response to the low interest rate environment  accompanied by an increase in the setback period from seven years to years and the recent introduction of the year mortality projection 
we expect new contracts to have comparable guarantee features for the foreseeable future 

table of contents additionally  of the billion of gmib total contract account value has been invested in managed volatility funds as of december  these funds seek to manage volatility by adjusting the fund holdings within certain guidelines based on capital market movements 
such activity reduces the overall risk of the underlying funds while maintaining their growth opportunities 
these risk mitigation techniques translate to a reduction or elimination of the need for us to manage the funds volatility through hedging or reinsurance 
we expect the proportion of total contract account value invested in these funds to increase for the foreseeable future  as new contracts with gmib are required to invest in these funds 
our gmib products typically have a waiting period of years to be eligible for annuitization 
as of december   only of our contracts with gmib were eligible for annuitization 
the remaining contracts are not eligible for annuitization for an average of years 
once eligible for annuitization  contractholders would only be expected to annuitize if their contracts were in the money 
we calculate in the moneyness with respect to gmib consistent with net amount at risk as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  by comparing the contractholders income benefits based on total contract account values and current annuity rates versus the guaranteed income benefits 
for those contracts with gmib  the table below presents details of contracts that are in the money and out of the money at december  in the moneyness total contract account value of total in millions in the money to  to  to  out of the money to  to  total gmib 
table of contents derivatives hedging variable annuity guarantees in addition to reinsurance and our risk mitigating steps described above  we have a hedging strategy that uses various over the counter and exchanged traded derivatives 
the table below presents the estimated fair value of the derivatives hedging our variable annuity guarantees december  primary underlying risk exposure notional estimated fair value notional estimated fair value instrument type amount assets liabilities amount assets liabilities in millions interest rate interest rate swaps    interest rate futures   interest rate options   foreign currency exchange rate foreign currency forwards  foreign currency futures equity market equity futures   equity options    variance swaps   total rate of return swaps   total the change in estimated fair values of our derivatives is recorded in policyholder benefits and claims if they are hedging guarantees included in future policy benefits  and in net derivative gains losses if they are hedging guarantees included in pabs 
our hedging strategy involves the significant use of static longer term derivative instruments to avoid the need to execute transactions during periods of market disruption or higher volatility 
we continually monitor the capital markets for opportunities to adjust our liability coverage  as appropriate 
futures are also used to dynamically adjust the daily coverage levels as markets and liability exposures fluctuate 
we remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay 
certain of our reinsurance agreements and most derivative positions are collateralized and derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements  both of which significantly reduce the exposure to counterparty risk 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that hedging and other risk management actions prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality  combined with adverse market events  produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed 
liquidity and capital resources overview our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally 
stressed conditions  volatility and disruptions in global capital markets  particular markets  or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us  in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors 
the global markets and economy continue to experience significant volatility that may affect our financing costs and market interest for our debt or equity securities

table of contents liquidity management based upon the strength of our franchise  diversification of our businesses  strong financial fundamentals and the substantial funding sources available to us as described herein  we continue to believe we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and unlikely but reasonably possible stress scenarios 
short term liquidity 
we maintain a substantial short term liquidity position  which was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
short term liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  excluding i cash collateral received under our securities lending program  and ii cash collateral received from counterparties in connection with derivatives 
we continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for metlife  inc and its subsidiaries in light of changing needs and opportunities 
liquid assets 
an integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets  which was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and publicly traded securities  excluding i cash collateral received under our securities lending program that has been reinvested  ii cash collateral received from counterparties in connection with derivatives  iii cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and securities on deposit with regulatory agencies  and iv securities held in trust in support of collateral financing arrangements and pledged in support of debt and funding agreements  derivatives and short sale agreements 
capital management we have established several senior management committees as part of our capital management process 
these committees  including the capital management committee and the enterprise risk committee  regularly review actual and projected capital levels under a variety of scenarios including stress scenarios and our capital plan in accordance with our capital policy 
the capital management committee is comprised of members of senior management  including metlife  inc s chief financial officer  treasurer and chief risk officer 
the enterprise risk committee is also comprised of members of senior management  including metlife  inc s chief financial officer  chief risk officer and chief investment officer 
our board and senior management are directly involved in the development and maintenance of our capital policy 
the capital policy sets forth  among other things  minimum and target capital levels and the governance of the capital management process 
all capital actions  including proposed changes to the capital plan  capital targets or capital policy  are reviewed by the finance and risk committee of the board prior to obtaining full board approval 
the board approves the capital policy and the annual capital plan and authorizes capital actions  as required

the company liquidity liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs 
we determine our liquidity needs based on a rolling six month forecast by portfolio of invested assets which we monitor daily 
we adjust the asset mix and asset maturities based on this forecast 
to support this forecast  we conduct cash flow and stress testing  which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and 
table of contents policyholder withdrawal 
we include provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of our products  including general account pension products sold to employee benefit plan sponsors 
certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product 
in the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs  we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need 
these options include cash flows from operations  the sale of liquid assets  global funding sources and various credit facilities 
under certain stressful market and economic conditions  our access to liquidity may deteriorate  or the cost to access liquidity may increase 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements or if we are required to post or return cash collateral in connection with derivatives or our securities lending program  we may have difficulty selling investment assets in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
in addition  in the event of such forced sale  accounting guidance requires the recognition of a loss for certain securities in an unrealized loss position and may require the impairment of other securities if there is a need to sell such securities  which may negatively impact our financial condition 
see risk factors investment related risks should the need arise  we may have difficulty selling certain holdings in our investment portfolio or our securities lending program in a timely manner and realizing full value given their illiquid nature 
in extreme circumstances  all general account assets within a particular legal entity other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose are available to fund obligations of the general account of that legal entity 
capital we manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings 
our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates  as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions 
rating agencies 
rating agencies assign insurer financial strength ratings to metlife  inc s domestic life insurance subsidiaries and credit ratings to metlife  inc and certain of its subsidiaries 
financial strength ratings indicate the rating agency s opinion regarding an insurance company s ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations 
credit ratings indicate the rating agency s opinion regarding a debt issuer s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner 
they are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity 
the level and composition of regulatory capital at the subsidiary level and our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our insurer financial strength and credit ratings 
each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology  and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors 
in addition to heightening the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies  rating agencies have increased and may continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews  may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 
downgrades in our financial strength ratings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways  including reducing new sales of insurance products  annuities and other investment products  adversely affecting our relationships with our sales force and independent sales intermediaries  materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders  requiring us to post additional collateral under certain of our financing transactions  
table of contents requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive  and adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices or at all 
a downgrade in the credit or insurer financial strength ratings of metlife  inc or its subsidiaries would likely i impact our ability to generate cash flows from the sale of funding agreements and other capital market products offered by our corporate benefit funding segment  ii impact the cost and availability of financing for metlife  inc and its subsidiaries and iii result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements  which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements

statutory capital and dividends 
our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements 
except for american life  risk based capital rbc requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the naic and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action 
rbc is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset  premium and statutory reserve items 
the formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer  including asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis 
the formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action  and not as a means to rank insurers generally 
these rules apply to each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries 
state insurance laws grant insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by  or take various actions against  insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain rbc levels 
at the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators  the total adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries was in excess of each of those rbc levels 
american life does not conduct insurance business in delaware or any other domestic state and  as such  is exempt from rbc requirements by delaware law 
in addition to delaware  american life operations are regulated by applicable authorities of the countries in which it operates and is subject to capital and solvency requirements in those countries 
the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can pay to metlife  inc or to other parent entities is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings and provides an additional margin for risk protection and investment in our businesses 
we proactively take actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives  which may include adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial resources from internal or external sources of capital 
certain of these activities may require regulatory approval 
furthermore  the payment of dividends and other distributions to metlife  inc and other parent entities by their respective insurance subsidiaries is governed by insurance laws and regulations

it is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings 
in some of the matters referred to herein  very large and or indeterminate amounts  including punitive and treble damages  are sought 
although in light of these considerations  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon our financial position  based on information currently known by us  in our opinion  the outcome of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect 
however  given the large and or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could  from time to time  have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
acquisitions 
cash outflows for acquisitions during the years ended december   and were million  million and billion  respectively 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain of these acquisitions 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our major contractual obligations at december  total one year or less more than one year to three years more than three years to five years more than five years in millions insurance liabilities and other policy related balances policyholder account balances payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions bank deposits debt investment commitments operating leases other total the contractual obligations have not been adjusted for businesses divested in such amounts are categorized according to the future timing of such contractual obligations as of december  prior to giving effect to pending divestitures 
the contractual obligations at december  do not include the obligation for an acquisition announced in february see metlife  inc capital and notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance liabilities 
insurance liabilities include future policy benefits  other policy related balances  policyholder dividends payable and the policyholder dividend obligation  which are all reported on the consolidated balance sheet and are more fully described in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts presented in the table reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others and i are based on mortality  morbidity  lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience and expectations of future payment patterns  and ii consider future premium receipts on current policies in force 
all estimated cash payments presented in the table are undiscounted as to interest  net of estimated future premiums on in force policies and gross of any reinsurance recoverable 
amounts related to other policy related balances are reported in the one year or less category due to their short term nature 
amounts related to policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity 
because the exact timing and amount of the ultimate policyholder dividend obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the policyholder dividend obligation is based upon a long term projection of the performance of the closed block  we have reflected the obligation at the amount of the liability  if any  presented in the consolidated balance sheet in the more than five years category 
additionally  the more than five years category includes estimated payments due for periods extending for more than years 
the sum of the estimated cash flows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the liability amounts of billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to i the time value of money  which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference  and ii differences in assumptions  most significantly mortality  between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date  and are partially offset by liabilities related to accounting conventions  or which are not contractually due  which are excluded from the table 
actual cash payments to policyholders may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated cash payments as presented in the table due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments 

table of contents for the majority of our insurance operations  estimated contractual obligations for future policy benefits and pabs as presented in the table are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes 
these cash flows are materially representative of the cash flows under gaap 
see policyholder account balances 
policyholder account balances 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the components of pabs 
see insurance liabilities regarding the source and uncertainties associated with the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and pabs 
amounts presented in the table represent the estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits  withdrawals  including unscheduled or partial withdrawals  policy lapses  surrender charges  annuitization  mortality  future interest credited  policy loans and other contingent events as appropriate for the respective product type 
such estimated cash payments are also presented net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable 
for obligations denominated in foreign currencies  cash payments have been estimated using current spot foreign currency rates 
the sum of the estimated cash flows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the liability amount of billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to i the time value of money  which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference  ii differences in assumptions  between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date  and iii liabilities related to accounting conventions  or which are not contractually due  which are excluded from the table 
payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions 
we have accepted cash collateral in connection with securities lending and derivatives 
as the securities lending transactions expire within the next year or the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain  the return of the collateral has been included in the one year or less category in the table 
we also held non cash collateral  which is not reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet  of billion at december  bank deposits 
bank deposits of billion exceed the amount on the balance sheet of billion due to the inclusion of estimated interest payments through the stated contractual terms to the depositor  and have not been reduced or otherwise adjusted as a result of the closing of the sale of the depository business on january  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
liquid deposits  including demand deposit accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts  are assumed to mature at carrying value within one year 
certificates of deposit are assumed to pay all interest and principal at maturity 
debt 
amounts presented in the table for debt include short term debt  long term debt  collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt securities  the total of which differs from the total of the corresponding amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheet due to the following i the amounts presented herein do not include premiums or discounts upon issuance or purchase accounting fair value adjustments  ii the amounts presented herein include future interest on such obligations for the period from january  through maturity  and iii the amounts presented herein do not include billion at december  of long term debt relating to cses as such debt does not represent our contractual obligations 
future interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at december  and  as such  does not consider the impact of future rate movements 
future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations for the period from january  through maturity  except with respect to junior subordinated debt which was computed using the stated rates through the scheduled redemption dates as it is our expectation that such obligations will be redeemed at that time 
inclusion of interest payments on junior subordinated debt securities through the final maturity dates would increase the contractual obligation by billion 
amounts presented include payments under capital lease obligations of million  million  million and million  in the one year or less  more 
table of contents than one year to three years  more than three years to five years and more than five years categories  respectively 
pursuant to collateral financing arrangements  metlife  inc may be required to deliver cash or pledge collateral to the respective unaffiliated financial institutions 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
investment commitments 
to enhance the return on our investment portfolio  we commit to lend funds under mortgage loans  bank credit facilities  bridge loans and private corporate bond investments and we commit to fund partnership investments 
in the table  the timing of the funding of mortgage loans and private corporate bond investments is based on the expiration dates of the corresponding commitments 
as it relates to commitments to fund partnerships and bank credit facilities  we anticipate that these amounts could be invested any time over the next five years  however  as the timing of the fulfillment of the obligation cannot be predicted  such obligations are presented in the one year or less category in the table 
commitments to fund bridge loans are short term obligations and  as a result  are presented in the one year or less category in the table 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and off balance sheet arrangements 
operating leases 
as a lessee  we have various operating leases  primarily for office space 
contractual provisions exist that could increase or accelerate those lease obligations presented  including various leases with early buyouts and or escalation clauses 
however  the impact of any such transactions would not be material to our financial position or results of operations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
other 
other obligations presented in the table are principally comprised of amounts due under reinsurance agreements  payables related to securities purchased but not yet settled  securities sold short  accrued interest on debt obligations  estimated fair value of derivative obligations  deferred compensation arrangements  guaranty liabilities  the estimated fair value of forward stock purchase contracts  and general accruals and accounts payable due under contractual obligations  which are all reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
if the timing of any of these other obligations is sufficiently uncertain  the amounts are included within the one year or less category 
items reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets that were excluded from the table represent accounting conventions or are not liabilities due under contractual obligations 
unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest of million and million  respectively  was excluded from the table as the timing of payment cannot be reliably determined 
separate account liabilities are excluded from the table 
generally  the separate account owner  rather than the company  bears the investment risk of these funds 
the separate account assets are legally segregated and are not subject to the claims that arise out of any of our other businesses 
net deposits  net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are fully offset by corresponding amounts credited to contractholders whose liability is reflected with the separate account liabilities 
separate account liabilities are fully funded by cash flows from the corresponding separate account assets and are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets 
we also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business  however  these purchase obligations were not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position at december  additionally  we have agreements in place for services we conduct  generally at cost  between subsidiaries relating to insurance  reinsurance  loans and capitalization 
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate insurance regulators as required

liquidity and capital sources in addition to the description of liquidity and capital sources in the company summary of primary sources and uses of liquidity and capital  the following additional information is provided regarding metlife  inc s primary sources of liquidity and capital dividends from subsidiaries 
metlife  inc relies in part on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements 
metlife  inc s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles 
the dividend limitation for us insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the surplus to policyholders at the end of the immediately preceding calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year 
statutory accounting practices  as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business  differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap

the dividend capacity of our non us operations is subject to similar restrictions established by the local regulators 
the non us regulatory regimes also commonly limit the dividend payments to the parent to a portion of the prior year s statutory income  as determined by the local accounting principles 
the regulators of our non us operations  including japan s financial services agency  may also limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the us if such transfers are deemed to be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of the non us operations  or for other reasons 
most of the non us subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries which are owned by various non us holding companies 
the capital and rating considerations applicable to the first tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow into metlife  inc we actively manage target and excess capital levels and dividend flows on a proactive basis and forecast local capital positions as part of the financial planning cycle 
the dividend capacity of certain us and non us subsidiaries is also subject to business targets in excess of the minimum capital necessary to maintain the desired rating or level of financial strength in the relevant market 
we cannot provide assurance that metlife  inc s subsidiaries will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to metlife  inc in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends and that the applicable regulators will not disapprove any dividends that such subsidiaries must submit for approval

table of contents we believe the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business 
operating revenues  operating expenses  operating earnings  operating earnings available to common shareholders  and operating return on common equity  should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap gaap revenues  gaap expenses  gaap income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  gaap net income loss available to metlife  inc s common shareholders  and return on common equity  respectively 
reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are included in results of operations 
in this discussion  we sometimes refer to sales activity for various products 
these sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under gaap  but are used as relevant measures of business activity 
additionally  the impact of changes in our foreign currency exchange rates is calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the current year and is applied to each of the comparable years 
in this discussion  we also provide forward looking guidance on an operating  or non gaap  basis 
a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures is not accessible on a forward looking basis because we believe it is not possible to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses  which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a significant impact on gaap net income

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we actively manage  measure and monitor the market risk associated with our assets and liabilities 
we have developed an integrated process for managing risk  which we conduct through our global risk management department  asset liability management unit  treasury department and investments department along with the management of our business segments 
we have established and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures at both the corporate and business segment level to minimize the effects of potential market volatility 
we regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate  equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
as a result of that analysis  we have determined that the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are materially exposed to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the equity markets 
global risk management 
we have established several financial and non financial senior management committees as part of our risk management process 
these committees manage capital and risk positions  approve alm strategies and establish appropriate corporate business standards 
further enhancing its committee structure  during  we created an enterprise risk committee 
the enterprise risk committee is comprised of members of senior management  including metlife  inc s chief financial officer  chief risk officer and chief investment officer 
this committee is responsible for reviewing all material risks to the enterprise and deciding on actions if necessary  in the event risks exceed desirable targets  taking into consideration best practices and the current environment to resolve or mitigate those risks 
we also have a separate global risk management department  which is responsible for risk management throughout metlife and reports to metlife s chief risk officer  who reports to metlife s chief executive officer 
the global risk management department s primary responsibilities consist of implementing a corporate risk framework  which outlines our approach for managing risk on an enterprise wide basis  developing policies and procedures for managing  measuring  monitoring and controlling those risks identified in the corporate risk framework  establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels  deploying capital on an economic capital basis  and reporting on a periodic basis to the finance and risk committee of the company s board of directors  with respect to credit risk  reporting to the investment committee of the company s board of directors  and reporting on various aspects of risk to financial and non financial senior management committees 
asset liability management 
we actively manage our assets using an approach that balances quality  diversification  asset liability matching  liquidity  concentration and investment return 
the goals of the investment process are to optimize  net of income tax  risk adjusted investment income and risk adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are reasonably managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the alm process is the shared responsibility of the alm unit  global risk management  the portfolio management unit  and the senior members of the business segments and is governed by the alm committees 
the alm committees duties include reviewing and approving target portfolios  establishing investment guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the alm process on a periodic basis 
the directives of the alm committees are carried out and monitored through alm working groups which are set up to manage by product type 
in addition  an alm steering committee oversees the activities of the underlying alm committees 

table of contents we establish target asset portfolios for each major insurance product  which represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund our liabilities within acceptable levels of risk 
these strategies are monitored through regular review of portfolio metrics  such as effective duration  yield curve sensitivity  convexity  liquidity  asset sector concentration and credit quality by the alm working groups 
market risk exposures we have exposure to market risk through our insurance operations and investment activities 
for purposes of this disclosure  market risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets 
interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate changes results most significantly from our holdings of fixed maturity securities  as well as our interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the fixed maturity securities include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  corporate bonds  mortgage backed and asset backed securities  all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium and long term interest rates 
the interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include debt  pabs related to certain investment type contracts  and net embedded derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits which have the same type of interest rate exposure medium and long term interest rates as fixed maturity securities 
we employ product design  pricing and alm strategies to reduce the potential effects of interest rate movements 
product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products and the ability to reset crediting rates for certain products 
alm strategies include the use of derivatives and duration mismatch limits 
see risk factors economic environment and capital markets related risks we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  and may cause our net investment income to vary from period to period 
foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar results from our holdings in non us dollar denominated fixed maturity and equity securities  mortgage loans  and certain liabilities  as well as through our investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the principal currencies that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in our investment portfolios and liabilities are the euro  the japanese yen and the british pound 
selectively  we use us dollar assets to support certain long duration foreign currency liabilities 
through our investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures  we are primarily exposed to the japanese yen  the british pound  the australian dollar  the mexican peso and the korean won 
in addition to hedging with foreign currency swaps  forwards and options  local surplus in some countries is held entirely or in part in us dollar assets which further minimizes exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk 
we have matched much of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets  thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation 
see risk factors risks related to our business fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our profitability 
equity market 
we have exposure to equity market risk through certain liabilities that involve long term guarantees on equity performance such as net embedded derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits  certain pabs  along with investments in equity securities 
we manage this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through our alm strategies including the dynamic hedging of certain variable annuity guarantee benefits 
we also manage equity market risk exposure in our investment portfolio through the use of derivatives 
equity exposures associated with other limited partnership interests are excluded from this section as they are not considered financial instruments under gaap 
management of market risk exposures we use a variety of strategies to manage interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and equity market risk  including the use of derivatives 

table of contents interest rate risk management 
to manage interest rate risk  we analyze interest rate risk using various models  including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments  including derivatives 
these projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of our in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments 
the department of financial services regulations require that we perform some of these analyses annually as part of our review of the sufficiency of our regulatory reserves 
for several of our legal entities  we maintain segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of alm and the allocation of investment income to product lines 
for each segment  invested assets greater than or equal to the gaap liabilities and any non invested assets allocated to the segment are maintained  with any excess swept to corporate other 
the business segments may reflect differences in legal entity  statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration  liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets 
certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities 
we measure relative sensitivities of the value of our assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing internal models 
these models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse  mortality and interest crediting rates 
in addition  these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments  sinking fund payments  principal payments  bond calls  mortgage loan prepayments and defaults 
common industry metrics  such as duration and convexity  are also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates 
in computing the duration of liabilities  consideration is given to all policyholder guarantees and to how we intend to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends 
each asset portfolio has a duration target based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio 
where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets  as is the case with certain retirement and group products  we may support such liabilities with equity investments  derivatives or interest rate curve mismatch strategies 
foreign currency exchange rate risk management 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is assumed primarily in three ways investments in foreign subsidiaries  purchases of foreign currency denominated investments and the sale of certain insurance products 
the foreign exchange committee  in coordination with the treasury department  is responsible for managing the exposure to investments in foreign subsidiaries 
limits to exposures are established and monitored by the treasury department and managed by the investments department 
the investments department is responsible for managing the exposure to foreign currency denominated investments 
exposure limits to unhedged foreign currency investments are incorporated into the standing authorizations granted to management by the board of directors and are reported to the board of directors on a periodic basis 
management of each of the company s segments is responsible for establishing limits and managing any foreign currency exchange rate exposure caused by the sale or issuance of insurance products 
we use foreign currency swaps  forwards and options to mitigate the liability exposure  risk of loss and the volatility of net income associated with its investments in foreign subsidiaries  foreign currency denominated fixed income investments and the sale of certain insurance products 
equity market risk management 
equity market risk exposure through the issuance of variable annuities is managed by our asset liability management unit in partnership with the investments department 
equity market risk is realized through its investment in equity securities and is managed by our investments department 
we use derivatives to mitigate our equity exposure both in certain liability guarantees such as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefit and equity securities 
these derivatives include exchange traded equity futures  equity index options contracts and equity variance swaps 
we also employ reinsurance to manage these exposures 

table of contents hedging activities 
we use derivative contracts primarily to hedge a wide range of risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  and equity market risk 
derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while considering their impact on accounting results and gaap and statutory capital 
the construction of our derivative hedge programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged 
some hedge programs are asset or liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce risk related to a group of liabilities or assets 
our use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as follows risks related to living guarantee benefits we use a wide range of derivative contracts to hedge the risk associated with variable annuity living guarantee benefits 
these hedges include equity and interest rate futures  interest rate swaps  currency futures forwards  equity indexed options and interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps 
minimum interest rate guarantees for certain liability contracts  we provide the contractholder a guaranteed minimum interest rate 
these contracts include certain fixed annuities and other insurance liabilities 
we purchase interest rate floors to reduce risk associated with these liability guarantees 
reinvestment risk in long duration liability contracts derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk related to certain long duration liability contracts  such as deferred annuities 
hedges include zero coupon interest rate swaps and swaptions 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we use currency swaps  forwards and options to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk 
these hedges primarily swap foreign currency denominated bonds  investments in foreign subsidiaries or equity market exposures to us dollars 
general alm hedging strategies in the ordinary course of managing our asset liability risks  we use interest rate futures  interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floors and inflation swaps 
these hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or inflation risk related to the existing assets or liabilities or related to expected future cash flows 
risk measurement sensitivity analysis we measure market risk related to our market sensitive assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates  equity market prices and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical change increase or decrease in interest rates  equity market prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that a change increase or decrease in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term 
in performing the analysis summarized below  we use market rates at december  the sensitivity analysis separately calculates each of our market risk exposures interest rate  equity market and foreign currency exchange rate relating to our trading and non trading assets and liabilities 
we modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of our market sensitive assets and liabilities as follows the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change increase or decrease in interest rates  the us dollar equivalent estimated fair values of our foreign currency exposures due to a change increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates  and the estimated fair value of its equity positions due to a change increase or decrease in equity market prices 

table of contents the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance 
we cannot ensure that our actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below 
limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis  including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgage loans  for the derivatives that qualify as hedges  the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market values  the analysis excludes liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts and real estate holdings  and the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the period 
accordingly  we use such models as tools and not as substitutes for the experience and judgment of our management 
based on our analysis of the impact of a change increase or decrease in market rates and prices  we have determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities from interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and equity market exposures 
the table below illustrates the potential loss in estimated fair value for each market risk exposure of our market sensitive assets and liabilities at december  december  in millions non trading interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk equity market risk trading interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk
