purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  including the use of call options and other derivative instruments  rule b trading plans  and accelerated repurchase programs 
the authorization has no specified termination date 
during fiscal  we paid  million to repurchase million shares of our common stock  including million shares with a fair value of million purchased as part of an asr agreement 
under the terms of the asr agreement  we also paid an additional million to the unrelated financial institution for shares which will be settled in the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million

table of contents the following table details the fee paid committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of may  in billions amount credit facility expiring april april total committed credit facilities uncommitted credit facilities total committed and uncommitted credit facilities to ensure availability of funds  we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding short term borrowings 
commercial paper is a continuing source of short term financing 
we have commercial paper programs available to us in the united states and europe 
our commercial paper borrowings are supported by billion of fee paid committed credit lines  consisting of a billion facility expiring in april and a billion facility expiring in april we also have million in uncommitted credit lines that support our foreign operations 
as of may   there were no amounts outstanding on the fee paid committed credit lines and million was drawn on the uncommitted lines 
the credit facilities contain several covenants  including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least times 
certain of our long term debt agreements  our credit facilities  and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants 
as of may   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
we have  million of long term debt maturing in the next months that is classified as current 
we believe that cash flows from operations  together with available short and long term debt financing  will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next months 
as of may   our total debt  including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges  was percent in fixed rate and percent in floating rate instruments  compared to percent in fixed rate and percent in floating rate instruments on may  the change in the fixed rate and floating rate percentages was driven by the issuance of fixed rate bonds in january growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures see the non gaap measures section below for our discussion of this measure  which is not defined by gaap 
return on average total capital decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions 
we also believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength 
our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal was compared to in fiscal the measure increased from fiscal as earnings before income taxes and after tax earnings from joint ventures increased by million and fixed charges decreased by million  driven primarily by lower interest 
our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased percentage points to percent in fiscal  driven by a higher rate of increase in cash flows from operations than in total debt 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we acquired a percent controlling interest in yoplait sas and a percent interest in yoplait marques sas sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of the entities 
we consolidated both entities into our consolidated financial statements 
at the date of the acquisition  we recorded the million fair value of sodiaal s percent interest in yoplait marques sas as a noncontrolling interest  and the million fair value of its percent interest in yoplait sas as a redeemable interest on our consolidated balance sheets 
these euro denominated interests are reported in us dollars on our consolidated balance sheets 
sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to a maximum of years 
as of may   the redemption value of the redeemable interest was million which approximates its fair value 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal  in conjunction with the consent of the class a investor  we restructured gmc through the distribution of its manufacturing assets  stock  inventory  cash and certain intellectual property to a wholly owned subsidiary 
gmc retained the remaining intellectual property 
immediately following the restructuring  the class a interests of gmc were sold by the then current holder to another unrelated third party investor 
the third party holder of the gmc class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate  currently equal to the sum of three month libor plus basis points  to the holder s capital account balance established in the most recent mark to market valuation currently million 
the preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the class a interest holder or through a remarketing auction 
the holder of the class a interests may initiate a liquidation of gmc under certain circumstances  including  without limitation  the bankruptcy of gmc or its subsidiaries  gmc s failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the class a interests  gmc s failure to comply with portfolio requirements  breaches of certain covenants  lowering of our senior debt rating below either baa by moody s or bbb by standard poor s  and a failed attempt to remarket the class a interests 
in the event of a liquidation of gmc  each member of gmc will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance 
we may avoid liquidation by exercising our option to purchase the class a interests 
we may exercise our option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value  plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make whole amount 
if we purchase these interests  any change in the unrelated third party investor s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of may   we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries  and guarantees and comfort letters of million for the debt and other obligations of non consolidated affiliates  mainly cpw 
in addition  off balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non cancelable operating leases  which totaled million as of may  as of may   we had invested in four variable interest entities vies 
none of our vies are material to our results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity as of and for the year ended may  we determined whether or not we were the primary beneficiary pb of each vie using a qualitative assessment that considered the vie s purpose and design  the involvement of each of the interest holders  and the risks and benefits of the vie 
we are the pb of three of the vies 
we provided minimal financial or other support to our vies during fiscal  and there are no arrangements related to vies that would require us to provide significant financial support in the future 
our defined benefit plans in the united states are subject to the requirements of the pension protection act ppa 
the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax qualified plans 
the ppa may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans 
we made million of voluntary contributions to our principal us plans in each of fiscal and fiscal we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal actual fiscal contributions could exceed our current projections  and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts or by changes in regulatory requirements 
additionally  our projections concerning timing of the ppa funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance  interest rates  and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 

table of contents the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations  including payments due by period payments due by fiscal year in millions total and thereafter long term debt a accrued interest operating leases b capital leases purchase obligations c total contractual obligations other long term obligations d total long term obligations a amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long term debt and do not include million for capital leases or million for net unamortized bond premiums and discounts and fair value adjustments 
b operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases 
c the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands 
for purposes of this table  arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  a pricing structure  and approximate timing of the transaction 
most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice usually days 
any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above 
d the fair value of our foreign exchange  equity  commodity  and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was million as of may   based on fair market values as of that date 
future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future 
other long term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits  including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment plans  and miscellaneous liabilities 
we expect to pay million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and million of deferred compensation in fiscal we are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal as of may   our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was million 
significant accounting estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations 
these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures  valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets  redeemable interest  stock based compensation  income taxes  and defined benefit pension  other postretirement and postemployment benefits 
promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers 
these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf  such as advertising or in store displays  discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices  payments to gain distribution of new products  coupons  contests  and other incentives  and media and advertising expenditures 
the media and advertising expenditures are generally recognized as expense when the advertisement airs 
the cost of payments to customers and other consumer related activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded  which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure 
the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels 
these estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales  the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities  and other factors 
differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 
our accrued trade  coupon  and consumer marketing liabilities were million as of may   and million as of 
table of contents may  because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant  if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group 
asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups 
measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair value 
fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals  as appropriate 
intangible assets goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units 
we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  to the fair value of the unit 
carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill 
if the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying amount of net assets including goodwill  impairment has occurred 
our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model 
growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long range planning process 
we also make estimates of discount rates  perpetuity growth assumptions  market comparables  and other factors 
we performed our fiscal assessment as of november   and determined there was no impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units as their related fair values were substantially in excess of their carrying values 
we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets  mainly brands  to determine if they are finite or indefinite lived 
reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight line basis  over their useful lives  generally ranging from to years 
our indefinite lived intangible assets  mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the pillsbury  totino s  progresso  green giant  yoplait  old el paso  yoki  and h agen dazs brands  are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we performed our fiscal assessment of our brand intangibles as of november  our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our annual long range plan  assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands  and a discount rate 
as of our assessment date  there was no impairment of any of our indefinite lived intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values 
as of may   we had billion of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows  materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted average cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 
in addition  we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including  but not limited to  ongoing operating losses  projected decreases in earnings  increases in the weighted average cost of capital or significant business disruptions 
the significant assumptions used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability  royalty rates  capital spending  depreciation and taxes  foreign currency exchange rates and a discount rate 
by their nature  these projections and assumptions are uncertain 
if we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment  then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary 

table of contents redeemable interest on july   we acquired a percent controlling interest in yoplait sas  a consolidated entity 
sodiaal holds the remaining percent interest in yoplait sas sodiaal has the ability to put a limited portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year up to a maximum of years 
this put option requires us to classify sodiaal s interest as a redeemable interest outside of equity on our consolidated balance sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by sodiaal 
when the put is no longer exercisable  the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets 
we adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest s redemption value  which approximates its fair value 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we adjusted the redeemable interest s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model 
the significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long range plan  capital spending  depreciation and taxes  foreign currency rates  and a discount rate 
stock based compensation the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements 
annually  we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility  employee exercise behavior  dividend yield  and the forfeiture rate 
we estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option  excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility 
we also have considered  but did not use  implied volatility in our estimate  because trading activity in options on our stock  especially those with tenors of greater than months  is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility 
if all other assumptions are held constant  a one percentage point increase in our fiscal volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal option awards by percent 
our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes 
the weighted average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table below 
an increase in the expected term by year  leaving all other assumptions constant  would increase the grant date fair value by percent 
the risk free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zero coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the black scholes option pricing model were as follows fiscal year estimated fair values of stock options granted assumptions risk free interest rate expected term years years years expected volatility dividend yield to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions  we are not required to true up grant date fair value based expense to final intrinsic values 
however  these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options  as explained in the following two paragraphs 
furthermore  historical data has a significant bearing on our forward looking assumptions 
significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions  which could then significantly impact the year over year comparability of stock based compensation expense 

table of contents any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow 
the actual impact on future years financing cash flows will depend  in part  on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 
realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid in capital within the consolidated balance sheets 
realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits  if any  and then charged directly to income tax expense  potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate 
we calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls  such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision 
however  as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control  it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
income taxes we apply a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
accordingly  we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement 
future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change 
we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states as well as various state  local  and foreign jurisdictions 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these liabilities  as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
our major taxing jurisdictions include the united states federal and state and canada 
various tax examinations by united states state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year  which vary by jurisdiction  but are generally from to years 
the irs initiated its audit of our fiscal and fiscal tax years during fiscal currently  several state examinations are in progress 
during fiscal  the irs concluded its field examination of our and tax years 
the irs has proposed adjustments related to the timing for deducting accrued bonus expenses 
we believe our position is supported by substantial technical authority and have filed an appeal with the irs appeals division 
the audit closure and related proposed adjustments did not have a material impact on our current year results of operations or financial position 
if we are unsuccessful in defending our position with respect to accrued bonuses  we will incur a one time cash tax payment of approximately million 
as of may   we have effectively settled all issues with the irs for fiscal years and prior 
also during fiscal  the california court of appeal issued an adverse decision concerning our state income tax apportionment calculations 
we had previously recorded a million increase in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions in fiscal following an unfavorable decision by the superior court of the state of california related to this matter 
we expect to pay a majority of the tax due related to this issue in fiscal the canadian revenue agency cra reviewed our canadian income tax returns for fiscal years to and raised assessments for these years to which we have objected 
during fiscal  the issue related to our fiscal year was resolved with no adjustment 
the issue for fiscal years and is currently under review by 
table of contents the us and canadian competent authority divisions 
the cra initiated its audit of our fiscal years through during fiscal year the cra audit for fiscal was closed with no significant adjustments 
the audit for fiscal years through is ongoing 
we do not anticipate that any united states or canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
as of may   our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was million 
we expect to pay approximately million related to uncertain tax positions and accrued interest in the next months 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
defined benefit pension  other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans defined benefit pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering most employees in the united states  canada  france  and the united kingdom 
benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation 
benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service 
our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws 
we made million of voluntary contributions to our principal us plans in each of fiscal and fiscal we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control 
in fiscal  we announced changes to our us defined benefit pension plans 
all new salaried employees hired on or after june  are eligible for a new retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan 
current salaried employees remain in the existing defined benefit pension plan with adjustments to benefits 
other postretirement benefit plans we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our retirees in the united states  canada  and brazil 
the united states salaried health care benefit plan is contributory  with retiree contributions based on years of service 
we make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis 
we did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the act  was signed into law in march we continue to evaluate the effect of the act  including its potential impact on the future cost of our benefit plans 
postemployment benefit plans under certain circumstances  we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the united states  canada  and mexico  and members of our board of directors  including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death 
we recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service 
postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service are charged to expense when incurred 
our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded 
we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working life 
accordingly  we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations 
assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long term rates of return on plan assets  the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans  and the health care cost trend rates 
expected rate of return on plan assets our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation  our historical long term investment performance  our estimate of future long term returns by asset class using input from our actuaries  investment services  and investment managers  and long term inflation assumptions 
we review this assumption annually for each plan  however  our annual investment performance for one particular year does not  by itself  significantly influence our evaluation 

table of contents the investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us 
our goal is to optimize the long term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk 
the defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes 
within asset classes  the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations 
for the defined benefit pension plans  the long term investment policy allocation is percent to equities in the united states  percent to international equities  percent to private equities  percent to fixed income  and percent to real assets real estate  energy  and timber 
for other postretirement benefit plans  the long term investment policy allocations are percent to equities in the united states  percent to international equities  percent to private equities  percent to fixed income  and percent to real assets real estate  energy  and timber 
the actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long term policy allocations based on relative market valuations 
our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were percent  percent  percent  percent  and percent for the     and year periods ended may  on a weighted average basis  the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was percent for fiscal  percent for fiscal  and percent for fiscal during fiscal  we lowered our weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states to percent due to generally lower expectations for long term rates of return across our asset classes due to the recent global economic slowdown and our expectation of an extended time frame for recovery 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on assets by basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by million for fiscal a market related valuation basis is used to reduce year to year expense volatility 
the market related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 
discount rates our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan obligations 
we also use the same discount rates to determine defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year 
we work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and  using the aa above median corporate bond yield  to develop a forward interest rate curve  including a margin to that index based on our credit risk 
this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 
our weighted average discount rates were as follows defined benefit pension plans other postretirement benefit plans postemployment benefit plans obligations as of may   and fiscal expense obligations as of may   and fiscal expense fiscal expense lowering the discount rates by basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal by approximately million 
all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

table of contents health care cost trend rates we review our health care cost trend rates annually 
our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries 
this information includes recent plan experience  plan design  overall industry experience and projections  and assumptions used by other similar organizations 
our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review  recent experiences  and short term expectations 
our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is percent for all retirees at the end of fiscal rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of percent is reached in for all retirees 
the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium 
assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 
a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects in millions one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal effect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of may  any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over years  resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded 
financial statement impact in fiscal  we recorded net defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan expense of million compared to million of expense in fiscal and million of expense in fiscal as of may   we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of billion on our defined benefit pension plans and million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans  mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates  partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets 
these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension expense and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 
we use the irs static mortality table projected forward to our plans measurement dates to calculate the year end defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense 
actual future net defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance  changes in future discount rates  changes in health care cost trend rates  and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans 
the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the act  was signed into law in march the act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from to with many provisions in the act requiring the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies 
estimates of the future impacts of several of the act s provisions are incorporated into our postretirement benefit liability 
given the complexity of the act  the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented  and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance  further financial impacts to our postretirement benefit liability and related future expense may occur 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting disclosure requirements about the nature and exposure of offsetting arrangements related to financial and derivative instruments 
the requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after january   which for us is the first quarter of fiscal the requirements will not impact our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
the requirements do not change the existing accounting and reporting for net income or other comprehensive income oci

net sales growth rates for our international segment excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange management and the board of directors believe that this measure of our international segment and region net sales provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance in markets outside the united states by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on year to year comparability given volatility in foreign exchange markets 
to present this information  current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than united states dollars are translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year  rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year 
therefore  the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year

we undertake no obligation to publicly revise any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of those statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions  authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities 
the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions 
we establish credit limits for each counterparty 
our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt  and existing and future issuances of floating rate debt 
primary exposures include us treasury rates  libor  euribor  and commercial paper rates in the united states and europe 
we use interest rate swaps  forward starting interest rate swaps  and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes  to reduce the volatility of our financing costs  and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating rate debt  based on current and projected market conditions 
generally under these swaps  we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount 
as of may   we had interest rate swaps with million of aggregate notional principal amount outstanding  all of which converts fixed rate notes to floating rate notes 
in advance of a planned debt refinancing  we had million net notional amount of treasury locks as of may  foreign exchange risk foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases  intercompany loans  product shipments  and foreign denominated commercial paper 
we are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar 
our principal exposures are to the australian dollar  brazilian real  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  euro  japanese yen  mexican peso  and swiss franc 
we mainly use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures 
we also generally swap our foreign denominated commercial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to us dollars or the functional currency of the entity with foreign exchange exposure  the gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses recorded in earnings on the associated borrowings 
we generally do not hedge more than months forward 
we also have many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros 
we previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuing euro denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts 
as of may   we had deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of million in aoci associated with hedging activity 

table of contents commodity price risk many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks 
we utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs  including grains oats  wheat  and corn  oils principally soybean  non fat dry milk  natural gas  and diesel fuel 
our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain 
we manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders  long term contracts with suppliers  exchange traded futures and options  and over the counter options and swaps 
we offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible 
as of may   the net notional value of commodity derivatives was million  of which million related to agricultural inputs and million related to energy inputs 
these contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next months 
equity instruments equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued 
we use equity swaps to manage this risk 
as of may   the net notional amount of our equity swaps was million 
value at risk the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices under normal market conditions 
a monte carlo value at risk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures 
the models assumed normal market conditions and used a percent confidence level 
the var calculation used historical interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future 
the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics data set 
the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur 
further  since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure  we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure 
the positions included in the calculations were debt  investments  interest rate swaps  foreign exchange forwards  commodity swaps  futures and options  and equity instruments 
the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity related positions that are offset by these market risk sensitive instruments 
the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a one day loss in fair value for our interest rate  foreign currency  commodity  and equity market risk sensitive instruments outstanding as of may   and may   and the average fair value impact during the year ended may  fair value impact in millions may  average during fiscal may  interest rate instruments foreign currency instruments commodity instruments equity instruments
