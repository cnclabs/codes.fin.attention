duke energy conducts its operations in the following business segments  all of which are considered reportable segments under the applicable accounting rules us franchised electric and gas usfe g  commercial power and international energy 
the remainder of duke energy s operations are presented as other 
duke energy s chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance 
for additional information on each of these business segments  including financial and geographic information about each reportable business segment  see note to the consolidated financial statements  business segments 
the following sections describe the business and operations of each of duke energy s reportable business segments  as well as other 
for more information on the operating outlook of duke energy and its reportable segments  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  introduction executive overview and economic factors for duke energy s business 
us franchised electric and gas us franchised electric and gas usfe g generates  transmits  distributes and sells electricity in most portions of north carolina  northern south carolina  central  north central and southern indiana  west central florida  and northern kentucky 
usfe g also transmits  distributes and sells electricity in southwestern ohio 
additionally  usfe g transports and sells natural gas in southwestern ohio and northern kentucky 
it conducts operations primarily through duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas  progress energy florida  duke energy indiana  and the regulated transmission and distribution operations of duke energy ohio duke energy indiana and duke energy ohio are collectively referred to as duke energy midwest 
these electric and gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  the north carolina utilities commission ncuc  the public service commission of south carolina pscsc  the florida public service commission fpsc  the public utilities commission of ohio puco  the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc  and the kentucky public service commission kpsc 
the substantial majority of usfe g s operations are regulated and  accordingly  these operations qualify for regulatory accounting treatment 
part i usfe g supplies electric service to million residential  general service and industrial customers 
its service area covers approximately  square miles with an estimated population of million 
usfe g provides regulated transmission and distribution services for natural gas to  customers in southwestern ohio and northern kentucky 
electricity is also sold wholesale to incorporated municipalities  electric cooperative utilities and other load serving entities 
duke energy carolinas and progress energy carolinas service areas share a diversified economy that is driven by service  manufacturing and government related output and jobs 
sales to general service customers  which include both service and government sectors  represent approximately one third of total retail sales and the main segments include health care  education  financial services  information technology and military buildings 
sales to industrial customers represent a little less than one third of total retail sales and key sectors are textiles  chemicals  rubber and plastics  paper  food beverage and auto manufacturing 
progress energy florida s service area has a strong base of residential customers and lower percentages of general service and industrial customers relative to the other duke energy utilities states 
sales to general service customers  which include both service and government sectors  represent approximately of total retail sales  the largest service segments include tourism  heath care and agriculture 
sales to industrial customers represent only around of total retail sales and main sectors include phosphate rock mining and processing  electronics design and manufacturing  and citrus and other food processing 
duke energy indiana s service area is characterized by a strong presence of manufacturing activity 
sales to industrial customers represent around of total retail volumes  the larger segments within the industrial class include primary metals  transportation equipment  building materials  food beverage and chemicals 
sales to general service customers represent approximately of total retail and the largest contributors to general service sales include retail  financial  health care and education services 
duke energy ohio s service area has a diversified economy that is driven by primarily by the services sector 
the contribution of manufacturing to the regional economy is lower relative to indiana and the carolinas service territories 
sales to general service customers  which include both service and government sectors  represent approximately of total retail sales and the main segments include healthcare  education  real estate and rental leasing  financial insurance services and wholesale trade services 
sales to industrial customers represent approximately one fourth of total retail sales and key industries are aerospace  primary metals  chemicals and food 
the number of residential  general service and industrial customers within the usfe g service territory  as well as sales to these customers  is expected to increase over time 
however  growth in the near term is being hampered by the current economic conditions 
while total industrial sales increased in when compared to  the growth rate was modest when compared to historical periods 
seasonality and the impact of weather usfe g s costs and revenues are influenced by seasonal patterns 
peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months  resulting in higher revenue and cash flows during those periods 
by contrast  fewer sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall  allowing for scheduled plant maintenance during those periods 
peak gas sales occur during the winter months 
residential and general service customers are most impacted by weather 
industrial customers are less weather sensitive 
estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions  with normal weather conditions defined as the long term average of actual historical weather conditions 
the estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers  temperature variances from a normal condition and customers historic usage levels and patterns 
the methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not and cannot consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity and relative temperature changes 
the precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long term weather trends to shorter term periods 
degree day data are used to estimate the energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures based on each day s average temperature 
heating degree days measure the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature  and cooling degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature 
each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling degree day 
competition retail 
usfe g s regulated utility businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories 
usfe g owns and operates all of the businesses and facilities necessary to generate  transmit and distribute electricity 
services are priced by state commission approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital 
this regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices 
usfe g s competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the on site generation of industrial customers 
usfe g is not aware of any enacted or proposed legislation in north carolina  south carolina  florida  kentucky or indiana that would give its retail customers the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry 
however  usfe g competes with suppliers of other forms of energy in connection with their retail customers 
although there is no pending legislation at this time  if the retail jurisdictions served by usfe g become subject to deregulation  the recovery of stranded costs could become a significant consideration 
stranded costs primarily include the generation assets of usfe g s regulated utilities whose value in a competitive marketplace would be less than their current book value  as well as above market purchased power commitments to qualified facilities qfs 
qfs are typically small power production facilities that generate power within a utility company s service territory for which the utility companies are legally obligated to purchase the energy of these facilities at an avoided cost rate 
thus far  all states that have passed restructuring legislation have provided for the opportunity to recover a substantial portion of stranded costs 
usfe g s largest stranded cost exposure is primarily related to progress energy florida s purchased power commitments with qfs  under which it has future minimum expected capacity payments through of billion 
progress energy florida was obligated to enter into these contracts under provisions of the public utilities regulatory policies act of progress energy florida continues to seek ways to address the impact of escalating payments under these contracts 
however  the fpsc allows full recovery of the retail portion of the cost of power purchased from qfs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies for additional information related these purchased power commitments 
wholesale 
usfe g competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales and for sales to municipalities and cooperatives 
usfe g also competes with other utilities and marketers in the wholesale electric business 
the principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price including fuel costs  availability of capacity and power and reliability of service 
wholesale electric prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs 
part i increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect usfe g s load forecasts  plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues 
wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of usfe g to attract new wholesale customers and to retain current wholesale customers 
energy capacity and resources usfe g owns over  megawatts of generation capacity 
for additional information on usfe g s generation facilities  see us franchised electric and gas in item properties 
energy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market 
factors that could cause usfe g to purchase power for its customers include generating plant outages  extreme weather conditions  generation reliability during the summer  growth  and price 
usfe g has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning  emergency assistance  sale and purchase of capacity and energy  and reliability of power supply 
usfe g s generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve native load customers 
all options  including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities  are continually evaluated on a real time basis to select and dispatch the lowest cost resources available to meet system load requirements 
the vast majority of duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas  and duke energy indiana s customer energy needs have historically been met by large  low energy production cost coal fired and nuclear generating units that operated almost continuously or at baseload levels 
however  recent commodity pricing trends have resulted in more combined cycle gas fired generation 
the vast majority of progress energy florida s customer energy needs have historically been met by large  low energy production cost nuclear  fossil steam and combined cycle gas fired generation 
however  due to the extended outage of the crystal river nuclear station unit crystal river unit nuclear plant a portion of customer needs have been served with purchased power for the past years 
ct s and cc s are less expensive to build and maintain than either nuclear or coal  and can be rapidly started or stopped as needed to meet changing customer loads or operated as base load units depending on commodity prices 
hydroelectric units produce low cost energy  but their operations are limited by the availability of water flow 
usfe g s pumped storage hydroelectric facilities in the carolinas offer the added flexibility of using low cost off peak energy to pump water that will be stored for later generation use during times of higher cost on peak periods 
these facilities allow usfe g to maximize the value spreads between different high and low cost generation periods 
recently completed generation projects 
during and  usfe g completed construction of and placed into service a total of  megawatts mw of new generation capacity including cliffside unit and the buck  dan river  lee and smith combined cycle natural gas facilities 
the total capital cost of this new generation capacity was billion 
generation projects currently under construction 
the following information relates to generation projects currently under construction by usfe g 
edwardsport integrated gasification combined cycle igcc plant 
duke energy indiana has completed the construction and is conducting testing of a mw integrated gasification combined cycle igcc power plant at its existing edwardsport generating station in knox county  indiana 
on december   the iurc approved the settlement agreement finalized in april between duke energy indiana  the office of utility consumer counselor oucc  the duke energy indiana industrial group and nucor steel indiana  on the cost increase for the construction of the edwardsport igcc plant 
the settlement agreement  as approved  caps costs to be reflected in customer rates at billion  including estimated allowance for funds used during construction afudc through june  duke energy indiana was allowed to recover afudc after june  until customer rates are revised  with such recovery decreasing to on afudc accrued after november  duke energy indiana s current cost estimate for the edwardsport igcc plant is approximately billion  excluding financing costs 
through december   duke energy indiana has recorded total pre tax impairment and other charges of million related to the edwardsport igcc plant 
if cost estimates for the plant increase  additional charges to expense  which could be material  could occur 
the edwardsport igcc plant is expected to be in service by mid see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters for further information 
lv sutton combined cycle facility 
progress energy carolinas is in the process of constructing an approximately mw natural gas fired generating facility at its existing lv sutton steam station sutton in new hanover county  north carolina 
the sutton project has an expected in service date of december based on updated cost estimates  total costs including afudc for the sutton project is estimated to be approximately million 
potential new construction 
the following information relates to major generation projects currently being evaluated for construction by usfe g 
shearon harris nuclear station expansion 
in  progress energy carolinas selected a site at its existing shearon harris nuclear station harris to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion 
on february   progress energy carolinas filed its combined construction and operating license col application with the nuclear regulatory commission nrc for two westinghouse electric advanced passive ap reactors at harris  which the nrc docketed on april  no petitions to intervene have been admitted in the harris col application 
levy nuclear station 
on july   progress energy florida filed its col application with the nrc for two westinghouse ap reactors at its proposed levy nuclear station levy  which the nrc docketed on october  various parties filed a joint petition to intervene in the levy col application 
on october  and november   the atomic safety and licensing board held an evidentiary hearing on portions of the intervention petitions 
a decision is expected in march in  the fpsc granted progress energy florida s petition for an affirmative determination of need and related orders requesting cost recovery under florida s nuclear cost recovery rule for levy  together with the associated facilities  including transmission lines and substation facilities 
on april   as part of its annual nuclear cost recovery filing  progress energy florida updated the levy project schedule and cost 
due to lower than projected customer demand  the lingering economic slowdown  uncertainty regarding potential carbon regulation and current low natural gas prices  progress energy florida has shifted the in service date for the first levy unit to  with the second unit following months later 
the revised schedule is consistent with the recovery approach included in the fpsc settlement agreement 
although the scope and overnight cost for levy  including land acquisition  related transmission work and other required investments  remain essentially unchanged  the shift in schedule will increase escalation and carrying costs and raise the total estimated project cost to between billion and billion 
part i along with the fpsc s annual prudence reviews  progress energy florida will continue to evaluate the project on an ongoing basis based on certain criteria  including  but not limited to  cost  potential carbon regulation  fossil fuel prices  the benefits of fuel diversification  public  regulatory and political support  adequate financial cost recovery mechanisms  appropriate levels of joint owner participation  customer rate impacts  project feasibility  demand side management dsm and energy efficiency ee programs  and availability and terms of capital financing 
taking into account these criteria  levy is considered to be progress energy florida s preferred baseload generation option 
under the terms of the fspc settlement agreement  progress energy florida began residential cost recovery of its proposed levy nuclear station effective in the first billing cycle of january at the fixed rates contained in the settlement and continuing for a five year period  with true up of any actual costs not recovered during the five year period occurring in the final year 
progress energy florida will not file for recovery of any new levy costs that were not addressed in the fspc settlement agreement before march  and will not begin recovering those costs from customers before the first billing cycle of january   unless otherwise agreed to by the parties to the agreement 
this amount is intended to recover the estimated retail project costs to date plus costs necessary to obtain the col and any engineering  procurement and construction cancellation costs  if progress energy florida ultimately chooses to cancel that contract 
in addition  the consumer parties will not oppose progress energy florida continuing to pursue a col for levy 
the fspc settlement agreement also provides that progress energy florida will treat the allocated wholesale cost of levy approximately million as a retail regulatory asset and include this asset as a component of rate base and amortization expense for regulatory reporting 
progress energy florida will have the discretion to accelerate and or suspend such amortization in full or in part provided that it amortizes all of the regulatory asset by december  william states lee iii nuclear station 
in december  duke energy carolinas filed an application with the nrc  which has been docketed for review  for a combined col for two westinghouse ap reactors for the proposed william states lee iii nuclear station lee nuclear station at a site in cherokee county  south carolina 
each reactor is capable of producing  mw 
submitting the col application does not commit duke energy carolinas to build nuclear units 
through several separate orders  the ncuc and pscsc have concurred with the prudency of duke energy incurring project development and pre construction costs 
potential plant retirements 
the subsidiary registrants periodically file integrated resource plans irp with their state regulatory commissions 
the irps provide a view of forecasted energy needs over a long term years  and options being considered to meet those needs 
the irp s filed by the subsidiary registrants in and included planning assumptions to potentially retire by  certain coal fired generating facilities in north carolina  south carolina  indiana and ohio that do not have the requisite emission control equipment  primarily to meet environmental protection agency epa regulations that are not yet effective 
additionally  management is considering the impact pending environmental regulations might have on certain coal fired generating facilities in florida 
these facilities total approximately  mw at eight sites 
duke energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal fired generating facilities earlier than the current estimated useful lives  and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any assets are retired 
for additional information related to potential plant retirements see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters 
fuel supply usfe g relies principally on coal  natural gas and nuclear fuel for its generation of electric energy 
the following table lists usfe g s sources of power and fuel costs for the three years ended december  generation by source a cost of delivered fuel per net kilowatt hour generated cents a coal b nuclear c oil and gas d all fuels cost based on weighted average b hydroelectric e total generation f a statistics begin july  for progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida 
b statistics related to coal generation and all fuels reflect usfe g s ownership interest in jointly owned generation facilities 
c statistics related to nuclear generation and all fuels reflect usfe g s ownership interest in jointly owned generation facilities 
crystal river unit has been in an outage since september d statistics related to oil and gas generation and all fuels reflect usfe g s ownership interest in jointly owned generation facilities 
cost statistics include amounts for light off fuel at usfe g s coal fired stations and combined cycle gas only 
e generating figures are net of output required to replenish pumped storage facilities during off peak periods 
f in addition  usfe g produced approximately  megawatt hours mwh in solar generation for  and  mwh in and  no fuel costs are attributed to this generation 
coal 
usfe g meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long term purchase contracts and short term spot market purchase agreements 
large amounts of coal are purchased under long term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface 
usfe g uses spot market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long term contracts 
expiration dates for its long term contracts  which have various price adjustment provisions and market re openers  range from to for the carolinas  to for florida  and to for indiana 
usfe g expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers for the quantities and quality of coal required as existing contracts expire  though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change 
the coal purchased for the carolinas is primarily produced from mines in central appalachia  northern appalachia and the illinois basin 
the coal purchased for florida is primarily produced from mines in central appalachia and the illinois basin 
the coal purchased for indiana is primarily produced in indiana and illinois 
usfe g has an adequate supply of coal under contract to fuel its projected operations and a significant portion of supply to fuel its projected operations 
coal inventory levels have increased during the past year due to the impact of mild winter weather and the economy on retail load and low natural gas prices which are resulting in higher combined cycle gas fired generation 
if these factors continue for an extended period of time  usfe g could have excess levels of coal inventory 
part i the current average sulfur content of coal purchased by usfe g is between and for the carolinas  between and for florida  and between and for indiana 
usfe g s scrubbers  in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide so emission allowances  enable usfe g to satisfy current so emission limitations for its existing facilities 
nuclear 
the industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates  the services to convert uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  the services to enrich the uranium hexafluoride  and the services to fabricate the enriched uranium hexafluoride into usable fuel assemblies 
usfe g has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors in the carolinas and florida 
uranium concentrates  conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long term supply contracts 
the contracts are diversified by supplier  country of origin and pricing 
usfe g staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter 
near term requirements not met by long term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases 
due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services  usfe g generally sources these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant by plant basis using multi year contracts 
usfe g has entered into fuel contracts that  based on its current need projections  cover of its uranium concentrates  conversion services  and enrichment services requirements through at least and cover fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least the cost of termination of nuclear fuel procurement contracts that progress energy florida has related to crystal river unit are not expected to be material 
for subsequent years  a portion of its fuel requirements are covered by long term contracts 
for future requirements not already covered under long term contracts  usfe g believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire  or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services 
gas 
oil and natural gas supply for usfe g s generation fleet is purchased under term and spot contracts from various suppliers 
duke energy carolinas and progress energy carolina s use derivative instruments to limit their exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas 
progress energy florida uses derivative instruments to limit its exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas  fuel oil and surcharges embedded in coal transportation agreements 
usfe g has dual fuel generating facilities that can operate with both fuel oil and natural gas 
the cost of usfe g s oil and natural gas is either at a fixed price or determined by market prices as reported in certain industry publications 
usfe g believes that it has access to an adequate supply of oil and gas for the reasonably foreseeable future 
usfe g s natural gas transportation for its gas generation is purchased under term firm transportation contracts with interstate and intrastate pipelines 
usfe g may also purchase additional shorter term transportation for its load requirements during peak periods 
many of the natural gas plants can be served by several supply zones and multiple pipelines 
purchased power 
usfe g purchased approximately million mwh  million mwh and million mwh of its system energy requirements during   and  respectively  under purchase obligations and leases and had  mw of firm purchased capacity under contract during these amounts include mwh for progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida for all periods presented 
these agreements include approximately mw of firm capacity under contract by progress energy florida with certain qfs 
usfe g may need to acquire additional purchased power capacity in the future to accommodate a portion of its system load needs 
usfe g believes that it can obtain adequate purchased power to meet these needs 
however  during periods of high demand  the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly affected 
gas for retail distribution 
usfe g is responsible for the purchase and the subsequent delivery of natural gas to native load customers in its ohio and kentucky service territories 
usfe g s natural gas procurement strategy is to buy firm natural gas supplies natural gas intended to be available at all times and firm interstate pipeline transportation capacity during the winter season november through march and during the non heating season april through october through a combination of firm supply and transportation capacity along with spot supply and interruptible transportation capacity 
this strategy allows usfe g to assure reliable natural gas supply for its high priority non curtailable firm customers during peak winter conditions and provides usfe g the flexibility to reduce its contract commitments if firm customers choose alternate gas suppliers under usfe g customer choice gas transportation programs 
in  firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided approximately of the natural gas supply 
these firm supply agreements feature two levels of gas supply  specifically i base load  which is a continuous supply to meet normal demand requirements  and ii swing load  which is gas available on a daily basis to accommodate changes in demand due primarily to changing weather conditions 
usfe g also owns two underground caverns with a total storage capacity of million gallons of liquid propane 
in addition  usfe g has access to million gallons of liquid propane storage and product loan through a commercial services agreement with a third party 
this liquid propane is used in the three propane air peak shaving plants located in ohio and kentucky 
propane air peak shaving plants vaporize the propane and mix it with natural gas to supplement the natural gas supply during peak demand periods 
duke energy ohio maintains natural gas procurement price volatility mitigation programs 
these programs pre arrange percentages of duke energy ohio s seasonal gas requirements 
duke energy ohio uses primarily fixed price forward contracts and contracts with a ceiling and floor on the price 
as of december   duke energy ohio had locked in pricing for of its remaining estimated winter system load requirements 
inventory generation of electricity is capital intensive 
usfe g must maintain an adequate stock of fuel  materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers 
as of december   the inventory balance for usfe g was  million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  for additional information 
nuclear insurance and decommissioning usfe g owns wholly or partially nuclear reactors located at seven stations 
nuclear insurance includes nuclear liability coverage  property  decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage  and replacement power expense coverage 
the other joint owners of the jointly owned nuclear reactors reimburse usfe g for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per the joint owner agreements 
the price anderson act requires nuclear plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability  which currently is billion 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies nuclear insurance  for more information 
usfe g has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely 
the ncuc  fpsc and the pscsc require usfe g regulated utilities to update their cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years 
duke energy carolinas most recent site specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies were completed in and showed total estimated nuclear decommissioning costs  including the cost to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination  of billion in part i dollars 
this estimate includes duke energy carolinas ownership interest in the jointly owned nuclear reactors 
the other joint owners of the jointly owned nuclear reactors are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their ownership interests in the station 
the balance of duke energy carolinas external nuclear decommissioning trust funds ndtf was  million as of december  and  million as of december  progress energy carolinas most recent site specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies were completed in and showed total estimated nuclear decommissioning costs  including the cost to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination of billion in dollars 
this estimate includes progress energy carolinas ownership interest in the jointly owned nuclear reactors 
the other joint owners of the jointly owned nuclear reactors are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their ownership interests in the station 
the balance of progress energy carolinas external ndtf was  million as of december  and  million as of december  progress energy florida s most recent site specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies were completed in in the progress energy florida rate case  the fpsc deferred review of the nuclear decommissioning study until while progress energy florida was not required to prepare a new site specific nuclear decommissioning cost study  it was required to update its study by incorporating the most currently available escalation rates 
this update was filed with the fpsc in december the fpsc approved this study on april  and showed total estimated nuclear decommissioning costs based on prompt dismantlement at the end of crystal river unit s useful life  including the cost to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination of million in dollars 
this estimate includes progress energy florida s ownership interest in the jointly owned nuclear reactor 
the other joint owners of the jointly owned nuclear reactor are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their ownership interests in the station 
with the decision in early to retire crystal river unit  as discussed below  it is anticipated that a delayed dismantlement approach to decommissioning  referred to as safstor  will be submitted to the nrc for approval 
this decommissioning approach is currently utilized at a number of retired domestic nuclear power plants and is one of three generally accepted approaches to decommissioning required by the nrc 
once an updated site specific decommissioning study is completed it will be filed with the fpsc 
as part of the evaluation of repairing crystal river unit  initial estimates of the cost to decommission the plant under the safstor option were developed  including components not subject to radioactive contamination  of million in dollars 
the balance of the external ndtf was million as of december  and million as of december  the ncuc  fpsc and the pscsc have allowed usfe g s regulated utilities to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail rates over the expected remaining service periods of their nuclear stations 
usfe g believes that the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates  when coupled with the existing fund balance and expected fund earnings  will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations  for more information 
the nuclear waste policy act of as amended provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high level radioactive waste materials 
the nuclear waste policy act of promotes increased usage of interim storage of spent nuclear fuel at existing nuclear plants 
usfe g will continue to maximize the use of spent fuel storage capability within its own facilities for as long as feasible 
under federal law  the us department of energy doe is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste 
progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida have contracts with the doe for the future storage and disposal of our spent nuclear fuel 
delays have occurred in the doe s proposed permanent repository to be located at yucca mountain  nevada 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  for information about complaints filed by progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida in the united states court of federal claims against the doe for its failure to fulfill its contractual obligation to receive spent fuel from nuclear plants 
failure to open yucca mountain or another facility would leave the doe open to further claims by utilities 
until the doe begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida will continue to safely manage their spent nuclear fuel 
with certain modifications and additional approvals by the nrc  including the installation and or expansion of on site dry cask storage facilities at robinson nuclear station robinson  brunswick nuclear station brunswick and crystal river unit  the progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida s spent nuclear fuel storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space for spent fuel generated by their respective systems through the expiration of the operating licenses  including any license renewals  for their nuclear generating units 
harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license 
regulation state the ncuc  the pscsc  the fpsc  the puco  the iurc and the kpsc collectively  the state utility commissions approve rates for retail electric service within their respective states 
in addition  the puco and the kpsc approve rates for retail gas distribution service within their respective states 
the state utility commissions  except for the puco  also have authority over the construction and operation of usfe g s generating facilities 
certificates of public convenience and necessity cpcn issued by the state utility commissions  as applicable  authorize usfe g to construct and operate its electric facilities  and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers 
prior approval from the relevant state utility commission is required for usfe g s regulated operating companies to issue securities 
the underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital  including equity 
each of the state utility commissions allows recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses  to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs  including any past over or under recovered costs  are prudent 
the clauses are in addition to approved base rates 
usfe g s regulated utilities generally do not earn a return on the recovery of eligible operating expenses under such clauses  however  in certain jurisdictions  they may earn a return on under recovered costs 
additionally  the commissions may authorize a return for specified investments for energy efficiency and conservation  capacity costs  environmental compliance and utility plant 
fuel  fuel related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by usfe g s regulated utilities 
usfe g uses coal  oil  hydroelectric  natural gas and nuclear power to generate electricity  thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel 
due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery  changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of usfe g  unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent 
however  delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery from ratepayers can adversely impact the timing of cash flow of usfe g 
progress energy florida is obligated to notify the fpsc and permitted to file for a midcourse change to the fuel factor between annual fuel hearings in the event its estimated over or under recovery of fuel costs meets or exceeds a threshold of ten percent of estimated total retail fuel revenues and  accordingly  has the ability to mitigate the cash flow impacts due to the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs 
the following is a summary of pending retail base rate case proceedings for each of usfe g s regulated utilities 
part i duke energy carolinas north carolina rate case 
on february   duke energy carolinas filed an application with the ncuc for an increase in base rates of approximately million  or an average increase in revenues 
the request for increase is based upon an return on equity and a capital structure of equity and long term debt 
the rate increase is designed primarily to recover the cost of plant modernization  environmental compliance and the capital additions 
duke energy carolinas expects revised rates  if approved  to go into effect late third quarter of progress energy carolinas north carolina rate case 
on october   progress energy carolinas filed an application with the ncuc for an increase in base rates of approximately million  or an average increase in revenues 
the request for increase is based upon an return on equity and a capital structure of equity and long term debt 
the rate increase is designed primarily to recover the cost of plant modernization and other capital investments in generation  transmission and distribution systems  as well as increased expenditures for nuclear plants and personnel  vegetation management and other operating costs

other nuclear matters 
the nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste  compliance with changing regulatory requirements  capital outlays for modifications and new plant construction  the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning plants at the end of their licensed lives  and requirements relating to nuclear insurance 
nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages  repairs  uprates and certain other modifications 
usfe g is subject to the jurisdiction of the nrc for the design  construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities 
in  the nrc renewed the operating license for duke energy carolinas three oconee nuclear units through for units and and through for unit in  the nrc renewed the operating licenses for all units at duke energy carolinas mcguire nuclear station mcguire and catawba nuclear station catawba 
the two mcguire units are licensed through and  respectively  while the two catawba units are licensed through the nrc has renewed the operating licenses for all of progress energy carolinas nuclear plants 
the renewed operating licenses for brunswick unit and unit  harris and robinson expire in   and  respectively 
the nrc issues orders with regard to security at nuclear plants in response to new or emerging threats 
the most recent orders include additional restrictions on nuclear plant access  increased security measures at nuclear facilities and closer coordination with our partners in intelligence  military  law enforcement and emergency response at the federal  state and local levels 
usfe g is in compliance with the requirements outlined in the orders through the use of additional security measures until permanent construction projects are completed in as the nrc  other governmental entities and the industry continue to consider security issues  it is possible that more extensive security plans could be required 
crystal river unit in september  crystal river unit began an outage for normal refueling and maintenance as well as an uprate project to increase its generating capability and to replace two steam generators 
during preparations to replace the steam generators  workers discovered a delamination or separation within the concrete at the periphery of the containment building  which resulted in an extension of the outage 
after analysis  it was determined that the concrete delamination at crystal river unit was caused by redistribution of stresses in the containment wall that occurred when an opening was created to accommodate the replacement of the unit s steam generators 
in march  the work to return the plant to service was suspended after monitoring equipment identified a new delamination that occurred in a different section of the outer wall after the repair work was completed and during the late stages of retensioning the containment building 
crystal river unit has remained out of service while progress energy florida conducted an engineering analysis and review of the new delamination and evaluated possible repair options 
subsequent to march  monitoring equipment has detected additional changes and further damage in the partially tensioned containment building and additional cracking or delaminations could occur 
progress energy florida developed a repair plan  which would entail systematically removing and replacing concrete in substantial portions of the containment structure walls  which had a preliminary cost estimate of million to billion 
in march  duke energy commissioned an independent review team led by zapata incorporated zapata to review and assess the progress energy florida crystal river unit repair plan  including the repair scope  risks  costs and schedule 
in its final report in late september  zapata found that the proposed repair scope appears to be technically feasible  but there were significant risks that need to be addressed regarding the approach  construction methodology  scheduling and licensing 
zapata performed four separate analyses of the estimated project cost and schedule to repair crystal river unit  including  i an independent review of the proposed repair scope without existing assumptions or data  of which zapata estimated costs of billion with a project duration of months  ii a review of progress energy florida s previous bid information  which included cost estimate data from progress energy florida  of which zapata estimated costs of billion with a project duration of months  iii an expanded scope of work scenario  that included the progress energy florida scope plus the replacement of the containment building dome and the removal and replacement of concrete in the lower building elevations  of which zapata estimated costs of approximately billion with a project duration of months  and  iv a worst case scenario  assuming progress energy florida performed the more limited scope of work  and at the conclusion of that work  additional damage occurred in the dome and in the lower elevations  which forced replacement of each  of which zapata estimated costs of billion with a project duration of months 
the principal difference between zapata s estimate and progress energy florida s previous estimate appears to be due to the respective levels of contingencies included by each party  including higher project risk and longer project duration 
progress energy florida has filed a copy of the zapata report with the fpsc and with the nrc 
the fpsc held a status conference on october  to discuss duke energy s analysis of the zapata report 
part i on february   following the completion of a comprehensive analysis  duke energy announced its intention to retire crystal river unit duke energy concluded that it did not have a high degree of confidence that repair could be successfully completed and licensed within estimated costs and schedule  and that it was in the best interests of progress energy florida s customers and joint owners and duke energy s investors to retire the unit 
progress energy florida developed initial estimates of the cost to decommission the plant during its analysis of whether to repair or retire crystal river unit with the final decision to retire  progress energy florida is working to develop a comprehensive decommissioning plan  which will evaluate various decommissioning options and costs associated with each option 
the plan will determine resource needs as well as the scope  schedule and other elements of decommissioning 
progress energy florida intends to use a safe storage safstor option for decommissioning 
generally  safstor involves placing the facility into a safe storage configuration  requiring limited staffing to monitor plant conditions  until the eventual dismantling and decontamination activities occur  usually in to years 
this decommissioning approach is currently utilized at a number of retired domestic nuclear power plants and is one of three generally accepted approaches to decommissioning required by the nrc 
once an updated site specific decommissioning study is completed it will be filed with the fpsc 
as part of the evaluation of repairing crystal river unit  initial estimates of the cost to decommission the plant under the safstor option were developed which resulted in an estimate in dollars of million 
see note for additional information 
additional specifics about the decommissioning plan are being developed 
progress energy florida maintains insurance coverage against incremental costs of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages at crystal river unit through neil 
neil provides insurance coverage for repair costs for covered events  as well as the cost of replacement power of up to million per event when the unit is out of service as a result of these events 
actual replacement power costs have exceeded the insurance coverage 
progress energy florida also maintains insurance coverage through neil s accidental property damage program  which provides insurance coverage up to billion with a million deductible per claim 
throughout the duration of the crystal river unit outage  progress energy florida worked with neil for recovery of applicable repair costs and associated replacement power costs 
neil has made payments on the first delamination  however  neil has withheld payment of approximately million of replacement power cost claims and repair cost claims related to the first delamination event 
neil had not provided a written coverage decision for either delamination and no payments were made on the second delamination and no replacement power reimbursements were made by neil since may these considerations led progress energy florida to conclude  in the second quarter of  that it was not probable that neil would voluntarily pay the full coverage amounts that progress energy florida believes them to owe under the applicable insurance policies 
consistent with the terms and procedures under the insurance coverage with neil  progress energy florida agreed to non binding mediation prior to commencing any formal dispute resolution 
on february   progress energy florida announced it and neil had accepted the mediator s proposal whereby neil will pay progress energy florida an additional million 
along with the million which neil previously paid  progress energy florida will receive a total of million in insurance proceeds 
as a result of the fpsc settlement agreement  progress energy florida will be permitted to recover prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs through its fuel clause without regard for the absence of crystal river unit for the period from the beginning of the crystal river unit outage through december  in accordance with the terms of the fpsc settlement agreement  with consumer representatives and approved by the fpsc  progress energy florida retained the sole discretion to retire crystal river unit progress energy florida expects that the fpsc will review the prudence of the retirement decision in phase of the crystal river unit delamination regulatory docket 
progress energy florida has also asked the fpsc to review the mediated resolution of insurance claims with neil as part of phase of this regulatory docket 
phase and phase hearings have been tentatively scheduled to begin on june  progress energy florida did not begin the repair of crystal river unit prior to december  consistent with the fpsc settlement agreement regarding the timing of commencement of repairs  progress energy florida recorded a regulatory liability of million in the third quarter of related to replacement power obligations 
this amount is included within fuel used in electric generation and purchased power in progress energy florida s and progress energy s statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended december  progress energy florida will refund this replacement power liability on a pro rata basis based on the in service date of up to million in and million in this amount is reflected as part of the purchase price allocation of the merger with progress energy in duke energy s consolidated financial statements 
progress energy florida also retained sole discretion to retire the unit without challenge from the parties to the agreement 
as a result  progress energy florida will be allowed to recover all remaining crystal river unit investments and to earn a return on the crystal river unit investments set at its current authorized overall cost of capital  adjusted to reflect a return on equity set at percent of the current fpsc authorized return on equity  no earlier than the first billing cycle of january in conjunction with the decision to retire crystal river unit  progress energy florida reclassified all crystal river unit investments  including property  plant and equipment  nuclear fuel  inventory  and deferred assets to a regulatory asset account 
at december   progress energy florida had  million of net investment in crystal river unit recorded in regulatory assets on its consolidated balance sheets 
progress energy florida recorded million of impairment and other charges related to the wholesale portion of crystal river unit investments  which are not covered by the fspc settlement agreement  and other provisions 
the significant majority of this amount is recorded in impairment charges on progress energy florida s and progress energy s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended december  this amount is reflected as part of the purchase price allocation of the merger with progress energy in duke energy s consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the fpsc settlement agreement  neil proceeds received allocable to retail customers will be applied first to replacement power costs incurred after december  through december   with the remainder used to write down the remaining crystal river unit investments 
progress energy florida believes the decision to retire crystal river unit  the actions taken and costs incurred in response to the crystal river unit delamination have been prudent and  accordingly  considers replacement power and capital costs not recoverable through insurance to be recoverable through its fuel cost recovery clause or base rates 
additional replacement power costs and exit cost to wind down the operations at the plant and decommission crystal river unit could be material 
retirement of the plant could impact funding obligations associated with progress energy florida s nuclear decommissioning trust fund 
progress energy florida is a party to a master participation agreement and other related agreements with the joint owners of crystal river unit which convey certain rights and obligations on progress energy florida and the joint owners 
in december  progress energy florida reached an agreement with one group of joint owners related to all crystal river unit matters 
progress energy florida cannot predict the outcome of matters described above

market environment and competition part i commercial power competes for wholesale contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity  coal  natural gas and emission allowances 
the market price of commodities and services  along with the quality and reliability of services provided  drive competition in the energy marketing business 
commercial power s main competitors include other nonregulated generators in the midwestern us  wholesale power providers  coal and natural gas suppliers  and renewable energy 
fuel supply commercial power relies on coal and natural gas for its generation of electric energy 
coal 
commercial power meets its coal demand through a portfolio of purchase supply contracts and spot agreements 
large amounts of coal are purchased under supply contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface 
commercial power uses spot market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by supply contracts 
expiration dates for its supply contracts  which have various price adjustment provisions and market re openers  range through commercial power expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers for the quantities and quality of coal required as existing contracts expire  though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change 
the majority of commercial power s coal is sourced from mines in the northern appalachian and illinois basins 
commercial power has an adequate supply of coal to fuel its projected operations 
the majority of commercial power s coal fired generation is equipped with flue gas desulfurization equipment 
as a result  commercial power is able to satisfy the current emission limitations for so for existing facilities

part i item a 
risk factors unless otherwise indicated  the risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks associated with all of the duke energy registrants 
risks identified at the subsidiary registrant level are generally applicable to duke energy 
the duke energy registrants franchised electric revenues  earnings and results are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation  transmission  distribution and related activities  which may limit their ability to recover costs 
the duke energy registrants franchised electric businesses are regulated on a cost of service rate of return basis subject to the statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of north carolina  south carolina  florida  ohio  indiana and kentucky 
if the duke energy registrants franchised electric earnings exceed the returns established by the state regulatory commissions  retail electric rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions  which may decrease the duke energy registrants future earnings 
additionally  if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service on a timely basis  the duke energy registrants future earnings could be negatively impacted 
if legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the duke energy registrants exclusive rights to serve their franchised customers were eroded  their future earnings could be negatively impacted 
the duke energy registrants plans for future expansion and modernization of their generation fleet subject them to risk of failure to adequately execute and manage their significant construction plans  as well as the risk of not recovering all costs or of recovering costs in an untimely manner  which could materially impact their results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the completion of the duke energy registrants anticipated capital investment projects in existing and new generation facilities is subject to many construction and development risks  including  but not limited to  risks related to financing  obtaining and complying with terms of permits  meeting construction budgets and schedules  and satisfying operating and environmental performance standards 
moreover  the duke energy registrants ability to recover all these costs and recovering costs in a timely manner could materially impact the duke energy registrants consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect the duke energy registrants financial position  results of operations or cash flows and their utility businesses 
increased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring efforts  including from the energy policy act of  could have a significant adverse financial impact on the duke energy registrants and consequently on their results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
increased competition could also result in increased pressure to lower costs  including the cost of electricity 
retail competition and the unbundling of regulated energy and gas service could have a significant adverse financial impact on the duke energy registrants due to an impairment of assets  a loss of retail customers  lower profit margins or increased costs of capital 
the duke energy registrants cannot predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets 
the duke energy registrants cannot predict when they will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation  nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the ability of the duke energy registrants to recover significant costs resulting from severe weather events is subject to regulatory oversight  and the timing and amount of any such recovery is uncertain and may impact their financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the duke energy registrants are subject to incurring significant costs resulting from damage sustained during severe weather events 
if the duke energy registrants cannot recover costs associated with future severe weather events in a timely manner  or in an amount sufficient to cover our actual costs  their financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely impacted 
energy conservation could negatively impact the duke energy registrants financial results 
certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates 
additionally  technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end use electric devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption 
to the extent conservation results in reduced energy demand or significantly slows the growth in demand  the duke energy registrants unregulated business activities could be adversely impacted 
in the duke energy registrants regulated operations  conservation could have a negative impact depending on the regulatory treatment of the associated impacts 
the duke energy registrants currently have energy efficiency riders in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency programs in north carolina  south carolina  florida  ohio and kentucky 
should the duke energy registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation  regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact 
the duke energy registrants businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation that will affect their operations and costs 
the duke energy registrants are subject to regulation by ferc  the nrc and various other federal agencies 
regulation affects almost every aspect of the duke energy registrants businesses  including  among other things  their ability to take fundamental business management actions  determine the terms and rates of transmission and distribution services  make acquisitions  issue equity or debt securities  engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and affiliates  and the ability of the operating subsidiaries to pay dividends to the duke energy registrants 
changes to these regulations are ongoing  and the duke energy registrants cannot predict the future course of changes in this regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that this changing regulatory environment will have on their businesses 
however  changes in regulation including re regulating previously deregulated markets can cause delays in or affect business planning and transactions and can substantially increase the duke energy registrants costs 
the duke energy registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that require significant capital expenditures that can increase cost of operations  and which may impact or limit business plans  or cause exposure to environmental liabilities 
the duke energy registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations  including air emissions  water quality  wastewater discharges  solid waste and hazardous waste 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  operating  and other costs 
these laws and regulations generally require the duke energy registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses  permits  inspections and other approvals 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures  including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties  and failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines  penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets 
the steps the duke energy registrants could be required to take to ensure that their facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive 
as a result  the duke energy registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facilities  which may cause the duke energy registrants to incur losses 
further  the duke energy registrants regulatory rate structure and their contracts with customers may not necessarily allow for the recovery of capital costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations 
also  the duke energy registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all part i required environmental regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development projects 
delays in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals  failure to obtain and comply with them or changes in environmental laws or regulations to more stringent compliance levels could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new facilities being prevented  delayed or subject to additional costs 
although it is not expected that the costs of complying with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the duke energy registrants financial position  results of operations or cash flows  no assurance can be made that the costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future will not have such an effect 
the epa has proposed new federal regulations governing the management of coal combustion by products  including fly ash 
these regulations may require the duke energy registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance costs 
other potential new environmental regulations  limiting the use of coal acquired from mountaintop removal and imposing additional requirements on water discharges associated with mountaintop removal  could increase costs of fuel and require the duke energy registrants to make additional related capital expenditures 
in addition  the duke energy registrants are generally responsible for on site liabilities  and in some cases off site liabilities  associated with the environmental condition of their power generation facilities and natural gas assets acquired or developed  regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown 
in connection with some acquisitions and sales of assets  the duke energy registrants may obtain  or be required to provide  indemnification against some environmental liabilities 
if the duke energy registrants incur a material liability  or the other party to a transaction fails to meet its indemnification obligations  the duke energy registrants could suffer material losses 
the duke energy registrants sales may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate  reliable and affordable access to transmission assets 
the duke energy registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market 
ferc s power transmission regulations  as well as those of duke energy s international markets  require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open access  non discriminatory basis 
if transmission is disrupted  or if transmission capacity is inadequate  the duke energy registrants ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered 
the different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures  which could affect the duke energy registrants growth and performance in these regions 
in addition  the independent system operators who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past  and may impose in the future  price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets 
these types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the duke energy registrants wholesale power marketing business 
the duke energy registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance that they and their rated subsidiaries will maintain investment grade credit ratings 
if the duke energy registrants or their rated subsidiaries are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings  they would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash  which may materially adversely affect their liquidity 
each of the duke energy registrants and their rated subsidiaries senior unsecured long term debt is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies 
the duke energy registrants cannot be sure that their senior unsecured long term debt or that of their rated subsidiaries will be rated investment grade in the future 
if the rating agencies were to rate the duke energy registrants or their rated subsidiaries below investment grade  the entities borrowing costs would increase  perhaps significantly 
in addition  their potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease 
further  if the duke energy registrants short term debt rating were to fall  access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited 
any downgrade or other event negatively affecting the credit ratings of the duke energy registrants subsidiaries could make their costs of borrowing higher or access to funding sources more limited  which in turn could increase their need to provide liquidity in the form of capital contributions or loans to such subsidiaries  thus reducing the liquidity and borrowing availability of the consolidated group 
a reduction in liquidity and borrowing availability could ultimately impact the ability to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of its international operations  which could result in significant income taxes that would have a material adverse effect on duke energy s results of operations 
a downgrade below investment grade could also require the duke energy registrants to post additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under various credit agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate derivative agreements  which would require cash payments 
all of these events would likely reduce the duke energy registrants liquidity and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on their financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the duke energy registrants are exposed to credit risk of the customers and counterparties with whom they do business 
adverse economic conditions affecting  or financial difficulties of  customers and counterparties with whom the duke energy registrants do business could impair the ability of these customers and counterparties to pay for services or fulfill their contractual obligations  including loss recovery payments under insurance contracts  or cause them to delay such payments or obligations 
the duke energy registrants depend on these customers and counterparties to remit payments on a timely basis 
any delay or default in payment could adversely affect the duke energy registrants cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
the duke energy registrants operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather 
electric power generation is generally a seasonal business 
in most parts of the us  and other markets in which duke energy operates  demand for power peaks during the warmer summer months  with market prices typically peaking at that time 
in other areas  demand for power peaks during the winter 
further  extreme weather conditions such as heat waves or winter storms could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced 
as a result  in the future  the overall operating results of the duke energy registrants businesses may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period to period comparison less relevant 
sustained severe drought conditions could impact generation by the duke energy registrants hydroelectric plants  as well as their fossil and nuclear plant operations  as these facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment 
furthermore  destruction caused by severe weather events  such as hurricanes  tornadoes  severe thunderstorms  snow and ice storms  can result in lost operating revenues due to outages  property damage  including downed transmission and distribution lines  and additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage 
the duke energy registrants are involved in numerous legal proceedings  the outcomes of which are uncertain 
adverse resolution of these matters could negatively affect the duke energy registrants financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the duke energy registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings  including claims for damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen prior to from the exposure to or use of asbestos at electric generation plants of duke energy carolinas 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the duke energy registrants cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance 
it is reasonably possible that the final resolution of part i some of the matters could require additional expenditures  in excess of established reserves  over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could have a material effect on the duke energy registrants cash flows and results of operations 
similarly  it is reasonably possible that the terms of resolution could require the duke energy registrants to change business practices and procedures  which could also have a material effect on their financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the duke energy registrants results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market  economic and other conditions that are beyond their control 
sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which the duke energy registrants operate and negatively influence energy operations 
declines in demand for energy as a result of economic downturns in the duke energy registrants franchised electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows  especially as industrial customers reduce production and  therefore  consumption of electricity and gas 
although the duke energy registrants franchised electric and gas business is subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs  such as fuel under periodic adjustment clauses  overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows  thus diminishing results of operations 
additionally  prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact the duke energy registrants results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges being recorded to write down the carrying value of certain assets  including goodwill  to their respective fair values 
the duke energy registrants also sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power markets on a contractual basis 
with respect to such transactions  the duke energy registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments through mandated rates  and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend  in large part  upon prevailing market prices 
these market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and could reduce the duke energy registrants revenues and margins and thereby diminish their results of operations 
factors that could impact sales volumes  generation of electricity and market prices at which the duke energy registrants able to sell electricity are as follows weather conditions  including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy usage for heating or cooling purposes  respectively  and periods of low rainfall that decrease the duke energy registrants ability to operate its facilities in an economical manner  supply of and demand for energy commodities  transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies which impact the duke energy registrants non regulated energy operations  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources  which are preferred by some customers over electricity produced from coal  nuclear or gas plants  and of energy efficient equipment which reduces energy demand  natural gas  crude oil and refined products production levels and prices  ability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory  such as coal  gas and uranium  electric generation capacity surpluses which cause the duke energy registrants non regulated energy plants to generate and sell less electricity at lower prices and may cause some plants to become non economical to operate  and capacity and transmission service into  or out of  the duke energy registrants markets 
coal inventory levels have increased due to mild weather  low natural gas and power prices resulting in higher combined cycle gas fired generation  and the economy s overall effect on load 
continuation of these factors for an extended period of time could result in additional costs of managing the coal inventory or other costs 
if these costs are not recoverable the duke energy registrants results of operations could be negatively impacted 
fluctuations in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the duke energy registrants operations as well as their financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the duke energy registrants are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  coal  fuel oil  nuclear fuel  electricity and other energy related commodities  including emission allowances  as a result of their ownership of energy related assets 
fuel costs are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses  subject to the approval of state utility commissions 
additionally  the duke energy registrants have hedging strategies in place to mitigate fluctuations in commodity supply prices  but to the extent that these do not cover the entire exposure to commodity price fluctuations  or their hedging procedures do not work as planned  there can be no assurances that the duke energy registrants financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations 
additionally  the duke energy registrants are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to perform their obligations 
should counterparties fail to perform  the duke energy registrants might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses in addition to the amounts  if any  already paid to the counterparties 
certain of the duke energy registrants hedge agreements may result in the receipt of  or posting of  derivative collateral with counterparties  depending on the daily derivative position 
fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the return of collateral received and or the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact our liquidity 
downgrades in the duke energy registrants credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements 
the duke energy registrants continually monitor derivative positions in relation to market price activity 
poor investment performance of the duke energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrants liquidity and results of operations 
the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors  such as the rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans  future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions made to the plans 
the subsidiary registrants participate in employee benefit plans sponsored by duke energy or progress energy 
the subsidiary registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to these plans 
without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and depending upon the other factors impacting costs as listed above  duke energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash 
such cash funding obligations  and the subsidiary registrants proportionate share of such cash funding obligations  could have a material impact on the duke energy registrants financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
potential terrorist activities or military or other actions  including cyber system attacks  could adversely affect the duke energy registrants businesses 
the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the us and its allies may lead to increased political  economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil which may have material adverse affects in ways the duke energy part i registrants cannot predict at this time 
in addition  future acts of terrorism and any possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the us and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the us or their international affiliates 
cyber systems  infrastructure and generation facilities such as the duke energy registrants nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups 
the potential for terrorism has subjected the duke energy registrants operations to increased risks and could have a material adverse effect on their businesses 
in particular  the duke energy registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for their cyber systems and plants  including nuclear power plants under the nrc s design basis threat requirements  such as additional physical plant security  additional security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident 
the insurance industry has also been disrupted by these potential events 
as a result  the availability of insurance covering risks the duke energy registrants and their competitors typically insure against may decrease 
in addition  the insurance the duke energy registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles  higher premiums  lower coverage limits and more restrictive policy terms 
information security risks have generally increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of cyber attacks 
through our smart grid and other initiatives  the duke energy registrants have increasingly connected equipment and systems related to the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity to the internet 
because of the critical nature of the infrastructure and the increased accessibility enabled through connection to the internet  the duke energy registrants may face a heightened risk of cyber attack 
in the event of such an attack  the duke energy registrants could have business operations disrupted  property damaged and customer information stolen  experience substantial loss of revenues  response costs and other financial loss  and be subject to increased regulation  litigation and damage to our reputation 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the duke energy registrants or which they currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the duke energy registrants financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrants results of operations 
certain events  such as an aging workforce  mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs  or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs 
the challenges include lack of resources  loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development 
in this case  costs  including costs for contractors to replace employees  productivity costs and safety costs  may rise 
failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees  including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees  or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business 
if the duke energy registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce  their financial position or results of operations could be negatively affected 
the duke energy registrants rely on access to short term borrowings and longer term capital markets to finance their capital requirements and support their liquidity needs 
access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions  many of which are beyond the duke energy registrants control 
the duke energy registrants businesses are financed to a large degree through debt and the maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from their assets 
accordingly  as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities  duke energy and the subsidiary registrants rely on access to short term money markets as well as longer term capital markets and the subsidiary registrants also rely on access to short term intercompany borrowings 
if the duke energy registrants are not able to access capital at competitive rates or at all  the ability to finance their operations and implement their strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected 
an inability to access capital may limit the duke energy registrants ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that they may otherwise rely on for future growth 
market disruptions may increase the duke energy registrants cost of borrowing or adversely affect their ability to access one or more financial markets 
such disruptions could include economic downturns  the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company  capital market conditions generally  market prices for electricity and gas  terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on their facilities or unrelated energy companies  or the overall health of the energy industry 
the availability of credit under duke energy s revolving credit facilities depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under such facilities to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise 
systematic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement 
duke energy maintains revolving credit facilities to provide back up for a commercial paper program for variable rate demand tax exempt bonds that may be put to the duke energy registrant issuer at the option of the holder and certain letters of credit at various entities 
these facilities typically include borrowing sublimits for the subsidiary registrants and financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity 
failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude duke energy from issuing commercial paper or the duke energy registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
additionally  failure to comply with these financial covenants could result in duke energy being required to immediately pay down any outstanding amounts under other revolving credit agreements 
duke energy s investments and projects located outside of the united states expose it to risks related to laws of other countries  taxes  economic conditions  political conditions and policies of foreign governments 
these risks may delay or reduce duke energy s realization of value from its international projects 
duke energy currently owns and may acquire and or dispose of material energy related investments and projects outside the us the economic  regulatory  market and political conditions in some of the countries where duke energy has interests or in which it may explore development  acquisition or investment opportunities could present risks related to  among others  duke energy s ability to obtain financing on suitable terms  its customers ability to honor their obligations with respect to projects and investments  delays in construction  limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights  and interruption of business  as well as risks of war  expropriation  nationalization  renegotiation  trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law  regulations  market rules or tax policy 
duke energy s investments and projects located outside of the united states expose it to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates 
these risks  and duke energy s activities to mitigate such risks  may adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations 
duke energy s operations and investments outside the us expose it to risks related to fluctuations in currency rates 
as each local currency s value changes relative to the us dollar duke energy s principal reporting currency the value in us dollars of duke energy s assets and liabilities in such locality and the cash flows generated in such locality  expressed in us dollars  also change 
duke energy s primary foreign currency rate exposure is to the brazilian real 
duke energy selectively mitigates some risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations by  among other things  indexing contracts to the us dollar and or local inflation rates  hedging through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency and hedging through foreign currency derivatives 
these efforts  however  may not be effective and  in some cases  may expose duke energy to other risks that could negatively affect its cash flows and results of operations 
part i duke energy s merger with progress energy may not achieve its intended results 
the merger is expected to result in various benefits  including  among other things  cost savings and operating efficiencies relating to the joint dispatch of generation and combining of fuel purchasing power 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties  including market conditions  risks related to duke energy s businesses  and whether the business of progress energy is integrated in an efficient and effective manner 
failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs  decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated by the combined company and diversion of management s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the combined company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
duke energy s and progress energy s ability to fully utilize tax credits may be limited 
in accordance with the provisions of internal revenue code section k  duke energy and progress energy have generated tax credits based on the content and quantity of coal based solid synthetic fuels produced and sold to unrelated parties 
this tax credit program expired at the end of the timing of the utilization of the tax credits is dependent upon duke energy s and progress energy s taxable income 
the timing of the utilization can also be impacted by certain substantial changes in ownership  including the merger of duke energy and progress energy 
additionally  in the normal course of business  duke energy s and progress energy s tax returns are audited by the irs 
if duke energy s and progress energy s tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit  there could be significant additional tax liabilities and associated interest for previously recognized tax credits  which could have a material adverse impact on duke energy s and progress energy s earnings and cash flows 
although duke energy and progress energy are unaware of any currently proposed legislation or new irs regulations or interpretations impacting previously recorded synthetic fuels tax credits  the value of credits generated could be unfavorably impacted by such legislation or irs regulations and interpretations 
duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities 
ownership interest in and operation of nuclear stations by duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida subject them to various risks 
these risks include  among other things the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage  handling and disposal of radioactive materials  limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations  and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives 
ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires compliance with licensing and safety related requirements imposed by the nrc 
in the event of non compliance  the nrc may increase regulatory oversight  impose fines  and or shut down a unit  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation 
revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the nrc  which could be prompted by  among other things  events within or outside of duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida s control  such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third party  could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures  as well as assessments to cover third party losses 
in addition  if a serious nuclear incident were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida s results of operations and financial condition 
ownership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants 
as discussed below  poor investment performance of these decommissioning trusts holdings and other factors impacting decommissioning costs could unfavorably impact duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida s liquidity and results of operations as they could be required to significantly increase their cash contributions to the decommissioning trusts 
market performance and other changes may decrease the value of duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida s nuclear decommissioning trust fund ndtf investments  which then could require significant additional funding 
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy future obligations to decommission nuclear plants 
duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts 
these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns  which may fall below projected rates of return 
although a number of factors impact funding requirements  a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning nuclear plants 
if duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida are unable to successfully manage the ndtf assets  their financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected 
the costs of retiring progress energy florida s crystal river unit could prove to be more extensive than is currently identified 
all costs associated with retirement of the crystal river unit asset  including replacement power  may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process 
early retirement could result in continued purchases of replacement power and or additional capital and operating costs associated with construction of replacement capacity resources to continue to service progress energy florida s customer needs 
however  there is no definitive plan for new generating capacity at this time 
in addition  exit costs to wind down operations and ultimately to retire and decommission the plant could exceed estimates and  if not recoverable through the regulatory process  could adversely affect duke energy s  progress energy s and progress energy florida s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
while the foregoing reflects progress energy florida s current intentions and estimates with respect to the retirement of crystal river unit  the cost of replacement power  and the degree of recoverability of these costs  are all subject to significant uncertainties 
additional developments with respect to crystal river unit  costs that are greater than anticipated and recoverability that is less than anticipated could adversely affect duke energy s  progress energy s and progress energy florida s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
duke energy ohio s and duke energy indiana s membership in a rto presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the price at which duke energy ohio can sell its generation capacity and energy is dependent on a number of factors  which include the overall supply and demand of generation and load  other state legislation or regulation  transmission congestion  and its business rules 
as a result  the prices in day ahead and real time energy markets and rto capacity markets are subject to price volatility 
administrative costs imposed by rtos  including the cost of administering energy markets  are also subject to volatility 
pjm interconnection  llc pjm conducts reliability pricing model rpm base residual auctions for capacity on an annual planning year basis 
the results of the pjm rpm base residual auction are impacted by the supply and demand of generation and load and also may be impacted by congestion and pjm rules relating to bidding for demand response and energy efficiency resources 
auction prices could fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time 
duke energy ohio cannot predict the outcome of future auctions  but if the auction prices are sustained at low levels  its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted 
part i the rules governing the various regional power markets may also change  which could affect duke energy ohio s and duke energy indiana s costs and or revenues 
to the degree duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana incur significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an rto  their results of operations may be impacted 
duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may be allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in rto transmission rate design 
duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decisions made by an rto rather than their own internal planning process 
while rto transmission rates were initially designed to be revenue neutral  various proposals and proceedings currently taking place by the ferc may cause transmission rates to change from time to time 
in addition  rtos has been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability  reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana 
duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may also incur fees and costs to participate in rtos 
as a members of an rto  duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana are subject to certain additional risks  including those associated with the allocation among rto members  of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in the rto markets and those associated with complaint cases filed against an rto that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by rto members  including duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana

the settlement agreement  as approved  caps costs to be reflected in customer rates at billion  including estimated financing costs through june  objectives duke energy will focus on obtaining constructive regulatory outcomes related to its pending and planned rate cases  achieving intended savings and efficiencies from its merger with progress energy  successfully managing the crystal river unit retirement and related regulatory proceedings  completing the remaining major capital projects in its fleet modernization program and optimizing nuclear fleet performance 
obtaining constructive regulatory outcomes 
the significant majority of duke energy s future earnings are anticipated to be contributed from usfe g  which consists of duke energy s regulated businesses 
duke energy has several ongoing rate cases and other regulatory proceedings in north carolina  ohio and indiana 
later in  duke energy carolinas and progress energy carolinas will file additional rate cases in south carolina 
duke energy expects resolution of these cases in or early these planned rates cases are needed to recover investments in duke energy s ongoing infrastructure modernization projects and operating costs 
planning for and obtaining favorable outcomes from these regulatory proceedings are key factors in achieving duke energy s long term growth assumptions 
achieving intended merger cost savings and efficiencies 
duke energy is taking a disciplined and systematic approach to merger integration work 
duke energy is on track to achieve intended savings and efficiencies 
in addition  through the efficient joint dispatch of the duke energy carolinas and progress energy carolinas generation fleets  duke energy is ahead of schedule in achieving fuels savings for customers in the carolinas  achieving million in fuel costs during the first six months following the merger 
these savings are passed to customers 
management of crystal river unit retirement 
on february   following the completion of a comprehensive analysis  duke energy announced its intention to retire crystal river unit duke energy concluded that it did not have a high degree of confidence that repair could be successfully completed and licensed within estimated costs and schedule  and that was in the best interests of progress energy florida s customers and joint owners and duke energy s investors to retire the unit 
progress energy florida developed initial estimates of the cost to decommission the plant during its analysis of whether to repair or retire crystal river unit with the final decision to retire  progress energy florida is working to develop a comprehensive decommissioning plan  which will evaluate various decommissioning options and costs associated with each option 
the plan will determine resource needs as well as the scope  schedule and other elements of decommissioning 
progress energy florida intends to use a safe part ii storage safstor option for decommissioning 
generally  safstor involves placing the facility into a safe storage configuration  requiring limited staffing to monitor plant conditions  until the eventual dismantling and decontamination activities occur  usually in to years 
this decommissioning approach is currently utilized at a number of retired domestic nuclear power plants and is one of three generally accepted approaches to decommissioning required by the nrc 
additional specifics about the decommissioning plan are being developed 
also on february   progress energy florida announced it and neil had accepted the mediator s proposal whereby neil will pay progress energy florida an additional million 
along with the million which neil previously paid  progress energy florida will receive a total of million in insurance proceeds 
progress energy florida expects that the fpsc will review the prudence of the retirement decision in phase of the crystal river unit delamination regulatory docket 
progress energy florida has also asked the fpsc to review the mediated resolution of insurance claims with neil as part of phase of this regulatory docket 
phase and phase hearings have been tentatively scheduled to begin on june  completing remaining major capital projects 
duke energy anticipates total capital expenditures of billion to billion in approximately billion of these expenditures are related to expansion and growth projects  including but not limited to  the edwardsport igcc plant and the sutton combined cycle facility 
following the completion of the sutton and edwardsport facilities in  the major components of duke energy s fleet modernization program will be complete 
the fleet modernization program will permit duke energy to retire up to  mw of older  less efficient coal fired units by  with approximately  mw retired by the end of optimizing nuclear fleet performance 
in  duke energy s nuclear fleet achieved a capacity factor over percent  excluding crystal river unit duke energy will continue to leverage best practices across the nuclear fleet to maintain and improve the performance of the fleet 
to meet this goal  targeted investments to increase overall fleet performance and to meet the nrc s fukushima related requirements totaling million are planned over the next three years 
economic factors for duke energy s business the historical and future trends of duke energy s operating results have been and will be affected in varying degrees by a number of factors  including those discussed below 
duke energy s revenues depend on customer usage  which varies with weather conditions and behavior patterns  general business conditions and the cost of energy services 
various regulatory agencies approve the prices for electric service within their respective jurisdictions and affect duke energy s ability to recover its costs from customers 
declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns reduce overall electricity sales and have the potential to lessen duke energy s cash flows  especially if retail customers reduce consumption of electricity 
a weakening economy could also impact duke energy s customers ability to pay  causing increased delinquencies  slowing collections and leading to higher than normal levels of accounts receivables  bad debts and financing requirements 
a portion of usfe g s business risk is mitigated by its regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of fuel costs under fuel adjustment clauses 
if negative market conditions should persist over time and estimated cash flows over the lives of duke energy s individual assets  including goodwill  do not exceed the carrying value of those individual assets  asset impairments may occur in the future under existing accounting rules and diminish results of operations 
a change in management s intent about the use of individual assets held for use versus held for sale could also result in impairments or losses 
duke energy evaluates the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of august and performs interim impairment tests if a triggering event occurs that indicates it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
for further information on key assumptions that impact duke energy s goodwill impairment assessments  see critical accounting policy for goodwill impairment assessments and note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill  intangible assets and impairments 
duke energy s goals for and beyond could also be substantially at risk due to the regulation of its businesses 
duke energy s businesses in the us are subject to regulation on the federal and state level 
regulations  applicable to the electric power industry  have a significant impact on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate 
usfe g has four outstanding rate cases and plans to initiate two additional rate cases in new legislation and changes to regulations are ongoing  including anticipated carbon legislation  and duke energy cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory or political environment or the ultimate effect that any such future changes will have on its business 
duke energy s earnings are impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices 
exposure to commodity prices generates higher earnings volatility in the unregulated businesses 
to mitigate these risks  duke energy enters into derivative instruments to effectively hedge some  but not all  known exposures 
additionally  duke energy s investments and projects located outside of the us expose duke energy to risks related to laws of other countries  taxes  economic conditions  fluctuations in currency rates  political conditions and policies of foreign governments 
changes in these factors are difficult to predict and may impact duke energy s future results 
duke energy also relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not met by cash flow from operations 
an inability to access capital at competitive rates or at all could adversely affect duke energy s ability to implement its strategy 
market disruptions or a downgrade of duke energy s credit rating may increase its cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to access one or more sources of liquidity 
for further information related to management s assessment of duke energy s risk factors  see item a  risk factors 
results of operations in this section  duke energy provides analysis and discussion of earnings and factors affecting earnings on both a gaap and non gaap basis 
management evaluates financial performance in part based on the non gaap financial measure  adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share eps  which is measured as income from continuing operations after deducting income attributable to noncontrolling interests  adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items and the mark to market impacts of economic hedges in the commercial power segment 
special items represent certain charges and credits  which management believes will not be recurring on a regular basis  although it is reasonably possible such charges and credits could recur 
mark to market adjustments reflect the mark to market impact of derivative contracts  which is recognized in gaap earnings immediately as such derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting or regulatory accounting treatment  used in duke energy s hedging of a portion of economic value of its generation assets in the commercial power segment 
the economic value of the generation assets is subject to fluctuations in fair value due to market price volatility of the input and output commodities eg  coal  power and  as such  the economic hedging involves both purchases and sales of those input and output commodities related to the generation assets 
because the operations of the generation assets are accounted for under the accrual method  management believes that excluding the impact of mark to market changes of the economic hedge contracts from operating earnings until settlement better matches the financial impacts of the hedge contract with the portion of economic value of the underlying hedged asset 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted eps provides useful information to investors  as it provides them an additional relevant comparison of duke energy s performance across periods 
management uses this non gaap financial measure for planning and forecasting and for reporting results to the board of directors  employees  shareholders  analysts and part ii investors concerning duke energy s financial performance 
the most directly comparable gaap measure for adjusted earnings and adjusted diluted eps is net income and diluted eps attributable to duke energy common shareholders  which includes the dollar and per share impact of special items  the mark to market impacts of economic hedges in the commercial power segment and discontinued operations

partially offset by unfavorable weather in compared to  higher depreciation and amortization expense  lower nonregulated midwest coal generation results  and incremental shares issued to complete the progress energy merger impacts per share diluted amounts only 
the variance in adjusted earnings for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to increased earnings associated with major construction projects at usfe g  effect of duke energy foundation funding  increased results in brazil due to higher average contract prices  increased earnings from national methanol company nmc  lower corporate governance costs  increased results in peru due to additional capacity revenues and an arbitration award  and increased results in central america due to higher average prices and volumes 
partially offset by less favorable weather in compared to at usfe g  increased operation and maintenance costs at usfe g  and lower volumes as a result of customer switching in ohio  net of retention by duke energy retail sales  llc duke energy retail at commercial power 
segment results in  management began evaluating segment performance based on segment income 
segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
segment income  as discussed below  includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with management s use of the new reporting measure  certain governance costs that were previously unallocated have now been allocated to each of the segments 
in addition  direct interest expense and income taxes are included in segment income 
prior year financial information has been recast to conform to the current year presentation 
none of these changes impacts the reportable operating segments or the duke energy registrants previously reported consolidated revenues  net income or eps 
management also uses adjusted segment income as a measure of historical and anticipated future segment and other performance 
adjusted segment income is a non gaap financial measure  as it is based upon segment income adjusted for special items and the mark to market impact of economic hedges in the commercial power segment 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted segment income provides useful information to investors  as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of a segment s performance across periods 
the most directly comparable gaap measure for adjusted segment income is reported segment income  which represents segment income from continuing operations  including any special items and the mark to market impact of economic hedges in the commercial power segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  business segments  for a discussion of duke energy s segment structure 
duke energy s segment income and adjusted segment income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other entities may not calculate segment income or adjusted segment income in the same manner 
the following tables reconcile adjusted segment income to segment income  and detailed discussions follow

part ii year ended december  as compared to december  operating revenues 
the variance was driven primarily by a  million increase in operating revenues due to the inclusion of progress energy operating revenues beginning in july  a million net increase in retail pricing and rate riders primarily due to revised retail rates resulting from the north carolina and south carolina rate cases implemented in the first quarter of  and revenues recognized for energy efficiency programs  and a million increase in fuel revenues including emission allowances driven primarily by higher revenues in ohio for purchases of power as a result of the new ohio esp  higher fuel rates for electric retail customers in all jurisdictions  and higher revenues for purchases of power in indiana and the carolinas  partially offset by decreased demand from electric retail customers in mainly due to unfavorable weather conditions  and lower demand and fuel rates in ohio and kentucky from natural gas retail customers 
fuel revenues represent sales to retail and wholesale customers 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in electric and gas sales net of fuel to retail customers due to unfavorable weather conditions in compared to for the carolinas  weather statistics for cooling degree days in were less favorable compared to  while cooling degree days in the ohio and indiana were favorable in compared to the same period in for the carolinas  ohio and indiana  weather statistics for heating degree days in were unfavorable compared to operating expenses 
the increase was driven primarily by a  million increase in operating expenses due to the inclusion of progress energy operating expenses beginning in july  a million increase due to an additional impairment and other charges related to the edwardsport igcc plant that is currently under construction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters  for additional information  a million increase in fuel expense including purchased power and natural gas purchases for resale primarily related to higher purchases of power in ohio as a result of the new ohio esp  higher volumes of natural gas used in electric generation  higher coal prices  higher purchased power costs in indiana and the carolinas  partially offset by lower volume of coal used in electric generation resulting from unfavorable weather conditions and lower coal fired generation due to low natural gas prices  lower prices for natural gas used in electric generation  and lower gas volumes and prices to full service retail gas customers  and a million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to increases in depreciation as a result of additional plant in service and amortization of regulatory assets 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in operating and maintenance expense primarily due to the establishment of regulatory assets in the first quarter of  pursuant to regulatory orders  for future recovery of certain employee severance costs related to the voluntary severance plan and other costs  and lower storm costs  partially offset by increased costs associated with the energy efficiency programs

matters impacting future other results duke energy previously held an effective interest in crescent  which was a real estate joint venture formed by duke energy in that filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in june on june   crescent restructured and emerged from bankruptcy and duke energy forfeited its entire ownership interest to crescent debt holders 
this forfeiture caused duke energy to recognize a loss  for tax purposes  on its interest in the second quarter of although crescent has reorganized and emerged from bankruptcy with creditors owning all crescent interest  there remains uncertainty as to the tax treatment associated with the restructuring 
based on this uncertainty  it is possible that duke energy could incur a future tax liability related to the tax losses associated with its partnership interest in crescent and the resolution of issues associated with crescent s emergence from bankruptcy

part ii critical accounting policies and estimates the application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to develop as duke energy s operations change and accounting guidance evolves 
duke energy has identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other various assumptions that it believes are reasonable at the time of application 
the estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information about duke energy s environment becomes available 
if estimates and judgments are different than the actual amounts recorded  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information 
duke energy discusses its critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with senior members of management and the audit committee  as appropriate 
duke energy s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
regulatory accounting duke energy s regulated operations the substantial majority of us franchised electric and gas s operations meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment 
as a result  duke energy records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under gaap in the us for nonregulated entities 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that have yet to be incurred 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes  historical regulatory treatment for similar costs in duke energy s jurisdictions  litigation of rate orders  recent rate orders to other regulated entities  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
based on this continual assessment  management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
this assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels  and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the asset write offs would be required to be recognized in operating income 
additionally  the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  plant and equipment  recognition of nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory assets or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets 
total regulatory assets for duke energy were  million and  million as of december  and  respectively 
total regulatory liabilities were  million and  million as of december  and  respectively 
the increases in regulatory assets and liabilities are driven primarily by the progress energy merger 
for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  regulatory matters 
in order to apply regulatory accounting treatment and record regulatory assets and liabilities  certain criteria must be met 
in determining whether the criteria are met for its operations  management makes significant judgments  including determining whether revenue rates for services provided to customers are subject to approval by an independent  third party regulator  whether the regulated rates are designed to recover specific costs of providing the regulated service  and a determination of whether  in view of the demand for the regulated services and the level of competition  it is reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover the operations costs can be charged to and collected from customers 
this final criterion requires consideration of anticipated changes in levels of demand or competition  direct and indirect  during the recovery period for any capitalized costs 
the regulatory accounting rules require recognition of a loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of a plant under construction or a recently completed plant will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made 
such assessments can require significant judgment by management regarding matters such as the ultimate cost of a plant under construction  regulatory recovery implications  etc 
as discussed in note  regulatory matters  during  and duke energy indiana recorded charges of million  million and million  respectively  related to the igcc plant currently under construction in edwardsport  indiana 
management will continue to assess matters as the construction of the plant and the related regulatory proceedings continue  and further charges could be required in or beyond 
also as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  acquisitions and sales of other assets  duke energy carolinas and progress energy carolinas recorded disallowance charges in in order to gain ferc approval of the merger between duke energy and progress energy 
as discussed further in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  regulatory matters  duke energy ohio discontinued the application of regulatory accounting treatment to portions of its generation operations in november in conjunction with the approval of its new electric security plan by the public utilities commission of ohio 
the effect of this change was immaterial to the financial statements 
goodwill impairment assessments duke energy s goodwill balances are included in the following table 
december  in millions us franchised electric and gas commercial power international energy total duke energy goodwill the duke energy allocates goodwill to a reporting unit  which duke energy defines as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
during  duke energy recorded  million of goodwill associated with the merger with progress energy 
this goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date  and was preliminarily allocated entirely to the usfe g segment 
the goodwill recognized is subject to change as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date 
see note  acquisitions and sales of other assets  for additional information on the merger with progress energy 
the remainder of usfe g s goodwill relates to the acquisition of cinergy in april commercial power s goodwill resulted from the acquisition of catamount energy corporation  a leading wind power company located in rutland  vermont  and has been allocated to the renewables reporting unit 
international energy s goodwill resulted from various acquisitions  including million from the acquisition of iberoamericana de energia ibener sa in chile 
see note  acquisitions and sales of other assets  for additional information 
part ii duke energy recorded impairments of million related to commercial power s nonregulated midwest generation reporting unit in subsequent to the impairment charge there is no recorded amount of goodwill at commercial power s nonregulated midwest generation reporting unit 
these impairment charges are recorded in goodwill and other impairment charges on duke energy s consolidated statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill  intangible assets and impairments for further information regarding the factors impacting the valuation of commercial power s nonregulated generation reporting unit 
duke energy determined that no other goodwill impairments existed in   and as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill  intangible assets and impairments  duke energy is required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
duke energy evaluates the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of august and performs interim impairment tests if a triggering event occurs that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
the analysis of the potential impairment of goodwill may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not ie  greater than percent chance that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its book value 
this is sometimes referred to as step zero and is an optional step in the annual goodwill impairment analysis 
if the results of qualitative assessments indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  the two step impairment test is required 
step one of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of reporting units with their carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount is less than fair value in step one  further testing of goodwill is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  step two must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of the goodwill impairment loss 
step two of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying value of the goodwill 
under step two  determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires the valuation of a reporting unit s identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination on the testing date 
the difference between the fair value of the entire reporting unit as determined in step one and the net fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment charge  if any  would be the difference between the carrying amount of goodwill and the implied fair value of goodwill upon the completion of step two 
as a result of the acquisition of progress energy  duke energy performed step one of the goodwill impairment test as of august   and concluded the fair value of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values  and thus  did not record any impairment charges 
in  duke energy performed the qualitative assessments under step zero and concluded that it was more likely than not the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
thus  the two step goodwill impairment test was not necessary in when performing step zero of the goodwill impairment test  duke energy s qualitative assessments include reviews of current forecasts compared to prior forecasts  consideration of recent fair value calculations  if any  review of the stock price performance of duke energy and its peers  credit ratings of duke energy s significant subsidiaries  updates to weighted average cost of capital wacc calculations or review of the key inputs to the wacc and consideration of overall economic factors  recent regulatory commission actions and related regulatory climates  and recent financial performance 
for purposes of the step one analyses  determination of the reporting units fair values is based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of duke energy s reporting units based on discounted future cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of duke energy s reporting units based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries 
generally  more emphasis is applied to the income approach as it represents management s best estimate of future value 
key assumptions used in the income approach analyses include  but are not limited to  estimated future cash flows and the use of an appropriate discount rate 
the market approach uses implied market multiples derived from comparable peer utilities and market transactions to estimate the fair value 
estimated future cash flows under the income approach are based to a large extent on duke energy s internal business plan  and adjusted as appropriate for duke energy s views of market participant assumptions 
duke energy s internal business plan reflects management s assumptions related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third party sources  projected commodity pricing data and potential changes in environmental regulations 
the business plan assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future  such as the outcome of future rate filings  future approved rates of returns on equity  anticipated earnings returns related to significant future capital investments  continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts 
management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operation  maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events 
in estimating cash flows  duke energy incorporates expected growth rates  regulatory and economic stability  the ability to renew contracts and other factors  into its revenue and expense forecasts 
should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions  revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of duke energy s reporting units to be significantly different in future periods 
one of the most significant assumptions that duke energy utilizes in determining the fair value of its reporting units under the income approach is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flows 
management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the wacc for each individual reporting unit 
the wacc takes into account both the pre tax cost of debt and cost of equity a major component of the cost of equity is the current risk free rate on twenty year us treasury bonds 
in the step one impairment tests  duke energy considered implied wacc s for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate wacc rates to use in its analysis 
as each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations  including factors such as regulation  the wacc for each reporting unit may differ 
accordingly  the waccs were adjusted  as appropriate  to account for company specific risk premiums 
for example  transmission and distribution reporting units generally would have a lower company specific risk premium as they do not have the higher level of risk associated with owning and operating generation assets nor do they have significant construction risk or risk associated with potential future carbon legislation or pending epa regulations 
the discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of august   for each of duke energy s domestic reporting units were commensurate with the risks associated with each reporting unit and ranged from to 
for duke energy s international operations  a country specific risk adder based on the average of risk premium for each separate jurisdiction in which international energy operates was added to the base discount rate to reflect the differing risk profiles of the jurisdictions and countries 
this resulted in a discount rate for the august  goodwill impairment test for the international operations of 
the underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time  subsequent changes  particularly changes in the discount rates or growth rates inherent in management s estimates of future cash flows  could result in future impairment charges 
management continues to remain alert for any indicators that the fair value of a reporting unit could be below book value and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate 
the majority of duke energy s business is in environments that are either fully or partially rate regulated 
in such environments  revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs  sales volumes and costs of capital 
accordingly  duke energy s regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects  positive or negative  of significant swings in market or economic conditions 
however  changes in discount rates may have a significant impact on the fair value of equity 
as of august   all of the usfe g part ii reporting units estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity by more than  except progress energy florida which has preliminarily been allocated goodwill of  million 
management will continue to monitor changes in the business  as well as overall market conditions and economic factors that could require additional impairment tests 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill  intangible assets and impairments  the fair value of usfe g s progress energy florida reporting unit and commercial power s renewables reporting unit are impacted by a multitude of factors  including legislative actions related to tax credit extensions  long term growth rate assumptions  the market price of power and discount rates 
as of december   the progress energy florida reporting unit and the renewables reporting unit s estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity by less than 
management continues to monitor these assumptions for any indicators that the fair value of the reporting unit could be below the carrying value  and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate long lived asset impairment assessments property  plant and equipment is stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value  if impaired 
duke energy evaluates property  plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets  as compared with the carrying value of the assets 
performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist  identifying and grouping affected assets  and developing the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset 
additionally  determining the fair value of the asset requires probability weighting the future cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made  estimates of future cash flows are  by nature  highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results 
if an impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the asset and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value 
for assets identified as held for sale  the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required 
until the assets are disposed of  their estimated fair value is re evaluated when circumstances or events change 
when it becomes probable that regulated generation  transmission or distribution assets have been abandoned  the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service 
the value that may be retained as an asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates  including any return 
as such  an impairment charge could be offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable 
as discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill  intangible assets and impairments  in the third quarter of  duke energy carolinas and progress energy carolinas recorded certain impairment charges in conjunction with the merger between duke energy and progress energy 
in the third quarter of  commercial power recorded million of pre tax impairment charges related to clean air act emission allowances which were no longer expected to be used as a result of the issuance of the final cross state air pollution rule 
in the second quarter of  commercial power recorded million of pre tax impairment charges related to certain generating assets and emission allowances in the midwest to write down the value of these assets to their estimated fair value  which was impacted by the epa s rules on emissions of nox and nox 
these impairment charges are recorded in goodwill and other impairment charges on duke energy s consolidated statement of operations 
revenue recognition revenues on sales of electricity and gas are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered 
operating revenues include unbilled electric and gas revenues earned when service has been delivered but not billed by the end of the accounting period 
unbilled retail revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue per kilowatt hour kwh or per mcf for all customer classes to the number of estimated kwh or mcf delivered but not billed 
unbilled wholesale energy revenues are calculated by applying the contractual rate per megawatt hour mwh to the number of estimated mwh delivered but not yet billed 
unbilled wholesale demand revenues are calculated by applying the contractual rate per mw to the mw volume delivered but not yet billed 
the amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including seasonality  weather  customer usage patterns  customer mix and the average price in effect for customer classes 
at december  and  duke energy had million and million  respectively  of unbilled revenues within restricted receivables of variable interest entities and receivables on the consolidated balance sheets 
accounting for loss contingencies duke energy is involved in certain legal and environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business 
in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements  management makes judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and records a loss contingency when it is determined that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
management regularly reviews current information available to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts and scenarios that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties  such as federal  state and local courts and other regulators 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual outcome once the contingency is resolved  which could have a material impact on future results of operations  financial position and cash flows of duke energy 
duke energy carolinas has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement relating to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from the exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted by duke energy carolinas on its electric generation plants prior to amounts recognized as asbestos related reserves in the respective consolidated balance sheets totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  and are classified in other within deferred credits and other liabilities and other within current liabilities 
these reserves are based upon the minimum amount in duke energy s best estimate of the range of loss for current and future asbestos claims through management believes that it is possible there will be additional claims filed against duke energy after in light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer term forecast  management does not believe that they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after related to such potential claims 
asbestos related loss estimates incorporate anticipated inflation  if applicable  and are recorded on an undiscounted basis 
these reserves are based upon current estimates and are subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
a significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed  the nature of the alleged injury  and the average cost of resolving each such claim could change our estimated liability  as could any substantial adverse or favorable verdict at trial 
a federal legislative solution  further state tort reform or structured settlement transactions could also change the estimated liability 
given the uncertainties associated with projecting matters into the future and numerous other factors outside our control  management believes that it is possible duke energy may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves 
part ii duke energy carolinas has a third party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to asbestos related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of million 
duke energy s cumulative payments began to exceed the self insurance retention on its insurance policy in future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by duke energy s third party insurance carrier 
the insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is million in excess of the self insured retention 
insurance recoveries of million and million related to this policy are classified in the consolidated balance sheets in other within investments and other assets and receivables as of december  and  respectively 
duke energy is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims 
management believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating 
for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining duke energy s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against duke energy s net deferred tax assets  if any 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the probability of realizing deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income and the use of tax planning that could impact the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
if future utilization of deferred tax assets is uncertain  a valuation allowance may be recorded against certain deferred tax assets 
in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets  management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the impacts of various items  including changes to income tax laws  duke energy s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods  as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities 
although management believes current estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant judgment is also required in computing duke energy s quarterly effective tax rate etr 
the etr calculations are revised each quarter based on the best annual tax assumptions available at that time  including  but not limited to  income levels  deductions and credits 
in accordance with interim tax reporting rules  a tax expense or benefit is recorded every quarter to adjust for the difference in tax expense computed based on the actual year to date etr versus the forecasted annual etr  excluding discrete items impacting income tax expense that have occurred year to date 
duke energy recognizes tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns  including the decision to exclude certain income or transactions from a return  when a more likely than not threshold is met for a tax position and management believes that the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
duke energy records the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position  assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
significant management judgment is required to determine recognition thresholds and the related amount of tax benefits to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
management reevaluates tax positions when new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 
the portion of the tax benefit which is uncertain is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
undistributed foreign earnings associated with international energy s operations are considered indefinitely reinvested 
as a result  no us tax is recorded on such earnings 
this assertion is based on management s determination that the cash held in international energy s foreign jurisdictions is not needed to fund the operations of its us operations and that international energy either has invested or has intentions to reinvest such earnings 
while management currently intends to indefinitely reinvest all of international energy s unremitted earnings  should circumstances change  duke energy may need to record additional income tax expense in the period in which such determination changes 
the cumulative undistributed earnings as of december   on which duke energy has not provided deferred us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes is approximately billion 
the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings is estimated at between million and million 
for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes 
pension and other post retirement benefits the calculation of pension expense  other post retirement benefit expense and pension and other post retirement liabilities require the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and reported liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
duke energy believes that the most critical assumptions for pension and other post retirement benefits are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
additionally  medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions are critical to duke energy s estimates of other post retirement benefits 
funding requirements for defined benefit plans are determined by government regulations 
duke energy made voluntary contributions to its defined benefit retirement plans of million in  million in  and million in and mandatory contributions of million in in  duke energy anticipates making million of contributions to its defined benefit plans 
duke energy and its subsidiaries  including progress energy and cinergy  maintain  and the subsidiary registrants participate in  non contributory defined benefit retirement plans 
the plans cover most us employees using a cash balance formula 
under a cash balance formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits that are based upon a percentage which may vary with age and years of service of current eligible earnings and current interest credits 
certain progress energy and cinergy us employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula 
under the cinergy final average earnings formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to a percentage of their highest year average earnings  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation maximum of years  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings times years of participation in excess of years 
under the progress energy final average earnings formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to a percentage of their highest year average earnings  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation maximum of years  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings times years of participation in excess of years 
duke energy also maintains  and the subsidiary registrants participate in  non qualified  non contributory defined benefit retirement plans which cover certain executives 
part ii duke energy and most of its subsidiaries provide  and the subsidiary registrants participate in  some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non contributory basis 
certain employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement  as defined in the plans 
duke energy recognized pre tax qualified pension cost of million in in  duke energy s pre tax qualified pension cost is expected to be million higher than in resulting primarily from a decrease in the discount rate on obligations and expected long term rate of return on assets  and months of expense recognition in for the progress energy plans 
duke energy recognized pre tax nonqualified pension cost of million and pre tax other post retirement benefits cost of million  in in  pre tax non qualified pension cost is expected to be approximately the same amount as in in  pre tax other post retirement benefits costs are expected to be approximately million higher than in resulting primarily from months of expense recognition in for the progress energy plans 
for both pension and other post retirement plans  duke energy assumes that its plan s assets will generate a long term rate of return of as of december  the assets for duke energy s pension and other post retirement plans are maintained in two master trusts  the duke energy master retirement trust and the progress energy master trust 
the investment objective of the master trusts is to achieve reasonable returns on trust assets  subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk  for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants 
the asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile 
us equities are held for their high expected return 
non us equities  debt securities  hedge funds  real estate and other global securities are held for diversification 
investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments 
duke energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
duke energy also invests other post retirement assets in the duke energy corporation employee benefits trust veba i 
the investment objective of veba i is to achieve sufficient returns  subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk  for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants 
veba i is passively managed 
the expected long term rate of return of for the plan s assets was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns for the master trusts based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers 
the weighted average returns expected by asset classes for the duke energy retirement master trust were for us equities  for non us equities  for global equities  for debt securities  for global private equity  for hedge funds  for real estate and for other global securities 
the weighted average returns expected by asset classes for the progress energy master trust were for us equities  for us equities  for global equities  for debt securities  for global private equity  for hedge funds  for real estate and for other global securities duke energy discounted its future us pension and other post retirement obligations using a rate of as of december  the discount rates used to measure benefit plan benefit obligations for financial reporting purposes should reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
as of december   duke energy determined its discount rate for us pension and other post retirement obligations using a bond selection settlement portfolio approach 
this approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for the projected benefit payments of the plan 
the selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non callable corporate bonds rated aa quality or higher 
after the bond portfolio is selected  a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in duke energy s pension and post retirement plans will impact duke energy s future pension expense and liabilities 
management cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
the following table presents the approximate effect on duke energy s pre tax pension expense  pension obligation and other post retirement benefit obligation if a change in rates were to occur 
qualified and non qualified pension plans other post retirement plans in millions effect on pre tax pension expense expected long term rate of return discount rate effect on benefit obligation at december  discount rate duke energy s us post retirement plan uses a medical care trend rate which reflects the near and long term expectation of increases in medical health care costs

as of december   the medical care trend rates were  which grades to by the following table presents the approximate effect on duke energy s pre tax other post retirement expense and other post retirement benefit obligation if a point change in the health care trend rate were to occur 
other post retirement plans in millions effect on other post retirement expense effect on other post retirement benefit obligation at december  part ii liquidity and capital resources overview at december   duke energy had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of billion  of which billion is held in foreign jurisdictions and is forecasted to be used to fund the operations of and investments in international energy 
to fund its domestic liquidity and capital requirements  duke energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations  borrowings  and its existing cash and cash equivalents 
the relatively stable operating cash flows of usfe g compose a substantial portion of duke energy s cash flows from operations and it is anticipated that it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
a material adverse change in operations  or in available financing  could impact duke energy s ability to fund its current liquidity and capital resource requirements 
weather conditions  commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses  including unplanned plant outages and storms  could affect the timing and level of internally generated funds 
ultimate cash flows from operations are subject to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  regulatory constraints  economic trends and market volatility see item a 
risk factors for details 
duke energy s projected capital and investment expenditures for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below 
in millions us franchised electric and gas commercial power  international energy and other total committed expenditures discretionary expenditures total projected capital and investment expenditures duke energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors 
based on this goal  the majority of duke energy s total projected capital expenditures are allocated to the usfe g segment 
the table below includes the components of projected capital expenditures for usfe g for the next three fiscal years 
infrastructure growth and nuclear projects maintenance nuclear fuel environmental total projected us franchised electric and gas capital and investment expenditures with respect to the capital expenditure plan  duke energy has flexibility within its billion budget to defer or eliminate certain spending should economic or financing conditions deteriorate 
of the billion budget  billion relates to projects for which management has committed capital  including  but not limited to  the final construction of the edwardsport igcc plant and the sutton combined cycle gas fired facility  and management intends to spend those capital dollars in irrespective of broader economic factors 
billion of projected capital expenditures are expected to be used primarily for overall system maintenance and upgrades  customer connections  compliance with new environmental requirements and corporate capital expenditures 
although these expenditures are ultimately necessary to ensure overall system maintenance and reliability  the timing of the expenditures may be influenced by broad economic conditions and customer growth  thus management has more flexibility in terms of when these dollars are actually spent 
the remaining planned capital expenditures of billion are of a discretionary nature and relate to growth opportunities in which duke energy may invest  provided there are opportunities that meet return expectations 
as a result of duke energy s significant commitment to modernize its generating fleet through the construction of new units  the ability to cost effectively manage the construction phase of current and future projects is critical to ensuring full and timely recovery of costs of construction 
should duke energy encounter significant cost overruns above amounts approved by the various state commissions  and those amounts are disallowed for recovery in rates  or if construction costs of renewable generation exceed amounts provided through power sales agreements and tax credits  future cash flows and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
duke energy s capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below 
projected actual actual equity debt duke energy s fixed charges coverage ratio  calculated using sec guidelines  was times for  times for  and times for in  duke energy currently anticipates issuing additional debt of billion  primarily for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and debt maturities 
due to the flexibility in the timing of projected capital expenditures  the timing and amount of debt issuances throughout could be influenced by changes in capital spending 
duke energy has access to a billion master credit facility  which is not restricted upon general market conditions 
at december   duke energy has available borrowing capacity of billion under this facility 
management currently believes that amounts available under its revolving master credit facility are accessible should there be a need to generate additional short term financing in management expects that cash flows from operations and issuances of debt will be sufficient to cover the funding requirements related to capital and investments expenditures  dividend payments and debt maturities 
see credit facilities section below for additional information regarding duke energy s credit facility 
duke energy monitors compliance with all debt covenants and restrictions and does not currently believe it will be in violation or breach of its significant debt covenants during however  circumstances could arise that may alter that view 
if and when management had a belief that such part ii potential breach could exist  appropriate action would be taken to mitigate any such issue 
duke energy also maintains an active dialogue with the credit rating agencies 
duke energy periodically evaluates the impact of repatriation of cash generated and held in foreign countries 
duke energy s current intent is to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings 
however  circumstances could arise that may alter that view  including a future change in tax law governing us taxation of foreign earnings 
if duke energy were to decide to repatriate foreign generated and held cash  recognition of material us federal income tax liabilities could be required

years ended december  in millions us franchised electric and gas commercial power international energy other total capital  investment and acquisition expenditures the increase in cash used in investing activities in as compared to is primarily due to the following a  million increase in capital  investment and acquisition expenditures primarily due to the inclusion of progress energy capital expenditures beginning july   higher expenditures on renewable energy projects and the chilean hydro acquisition  net of lower spending on duke energy ongoing infrastructure modernization program as these projects near completion and a million increase in restricted cash primarily due to a secured debt issuance related to chilean hydro acquisition 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in as compared to is primarily due to the following a million decrease in proceeds from sales of equity investments and other assets  and sales of and collections on notes receivable as result of cash received in from the sale of a interest in dukenet and the sale of duke energy s interest in q comm  partially offset by the sale of windstream stock received in conjunction with the q comm sale in december and a million increase in purchases of available for sale securities  net of proceeds  due to the investment of excess cash held in foreign jurisdictions 
these increases in cash used were partially offset by the following a million decrease in capital  investment and acquisition expenditures primarily due to construction of the edwardsport igcc plant and cliffside unit nearing completion

credit facilities master credit facility summary 
in november  duke energy entered into a billion  year master credit facility  expiring in november  with billion available at closing and the remaining billion available following successful completion of the merger with progress energy 
in october  the duke energy registrants reached an agreement with banks representing billion of commitments under the master credit facility to extend the expiration date by one year to november through november  the available credit under this facility remains billion 
the duke energy registrants each have borrowing capacity under the master credit facility up to specified sublimits for each borrower 
however  duke energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower  subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower 
see the table below for the borrowing sublimits for each of the borrowers as of december  the amount available under the master credit facility is reduced by the use of the master credit facility to backstop the issuances of commercial paper  certain letters of credit and variable rate demand tax exempt bonds that may be put to the company at the option of the holder 
borrowing sublimits for the subsidiary registrants are also reduced for amounts outstanding under the money pool arrangement 
the credit facility contains a covenant requiring the debt to total capitalization ratio to not exceed for each borrower

b duke energy issued million of commercial paper and loaned the proceeds through the money pool to duke energy carolinas and duke energy indiana 
the balances are classified as long term borrowings within long term debt in duke energy carolina s and duke energy indiana s consolidated balance sheets 
in january  duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky collectively entered into a million year bilateral letter of credit agreement  under which duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky may request the issuance of letters of credit up to million and million  respectively  on their behalf to support various series of variable rate demand bonds 
in addition  duke energy indiana entered into a million year bilateral letter of credit facility 
these credit facilities may not be used for any purpose other than to support the variable rate demand bonds issued by duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky 
in february  letters of credit were issued corresponding to the amount of the facilities to support various series of tax exempt bonds at duke energy indiana and duke energy kentucky 
in february  the letters of credit were amended to extend the expiration date to january duke energy s debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants 
failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and or termination of the agreements 
as of december   duke energy was in compliance with all covenants related to its significant debt agreements 
in addition  some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment  or to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries 
none of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses 
credit ratings 
duke energy and certain subsidiaries each hold credit ratings by fitch ratings fitch  moody s investors service moody s and standard poor s s p 
duke energy s corporate credit rating and issuer credit rating from fitch  moody s and s p  respectively  as of february  is bbb  baa and bbb  respectively 
as of february   the duke energy registrants have a stable outlook rating from fitch and moody s  with the exception of progress energy florida  which has a negative outlook at fitch 
in addition  the duke energy registrants have a negative outlook rating from s p

if  as a result of market conditions or other factors  duke energy is unable to maintain its current balance sheet strength  or if its earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates  duke energy s credit ratings could be negatively impacted 
credit related clauses 
duke energy may be required to repay certain debt should the credit ratings at duke energy carolinas fall to a certain level at s p or moody s 
as of december   duke energy had million of senior unsecured notes which mature serially through that may be required to be repaid if duke energy carolinas senior unsecured debt ratings fall below bbb at s p or baa at moody s 
first mortgage bond restrictions 
the subsidiary registrants first mortgage bonds are secured under their respective mortgage indentures 
each mortgage constitutes a first lien on substantially all of the fixed properties of the respective company  subject to certain permitted encumbrances and exceptions 
the lien of each mortgage also covers subsequently acquired property 
each mortgage allows the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds based on property additions  retirements of first mortgage bonds and the deposit of cash if certain conditions are satisfied 
most of the subsidiary registrants are required to pass a net earnings test in order to issue new first mortgage bonds  other than on the basis of retired bonds under certain circumstances 
the test requires that the issuer s adjusted net earnings  which is calculated based on results for consecutive months within the prior to months  be at least twice the annual interest requirement for bonds currently outstanding and to be outstanding 
duke energy indiana s and progress energy florida s ratios of net earnings to the annual interest requirement for bonds have at times in been below times  due to various charges to operating expenses 
as discussed in note  regulatory matters  these charges and any future charges may impact future net earnings tests and affect the ability of duke energy indiana and progress energy florida to issue first mortgage bonds 
in the event duke energy indiana s or progress energy florida s long term debt requirements exceed its first mortgage bond capacity  duke energy indiana or progress energy florida can access alternative sources of capital  including  but not limited to issuing unsecured debt  borrowing under the money pool  entering into bilateral direct loan arrangements  and  if necessary  utilizing available capacity under the master credit facility 
all other dec registrants have earnings substantially in excess of the net earnings test requirement for issuing first mortgage bonds 
other financing matters 
the following table shows significant amounts presented as current maturities of long term debt on the duke energy registrants respective consolidated balance sheets as of december  the amounts were presented as long term debt as of december   except for the secured debt

the internotes will be issued in the retail markets as direct  unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of duke energy corporation 
the net proceeds from the sale of internotes will be used to fund capital expenditures in duke energy s unregulated businesses and for general corporate purposes 
the balance as of december  is million  with maturities ranging from to years 
the notes reflect long term debt obligations of duke energy and are reflected as long term debt on duke energy s consolidated balance sheets 
on march   progress energy  as a well known seasoned issuer  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida filed a combined shelf registration statement with the sec  which became effective upon filing with the sec 
the registration statement is effective for three years and does not limit the amount or number of various securities that can be issued 
on july   progress energy deregistered its equity securities from the registration statement in connection with the merger with progress energy  but retained its ability to issue senior debt securities and junior subordinated debentures under the registration statement 
however  we do not expect progress energy to issue any new securities of these types in the part ii future 
under progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida s registration statements  they may issue various long term debt securities and preferred stock 
on april   duke energy filed a registration statement form s with the sec to sell up to billion maximum of million of notes outstanding at any particular time of variable denomination floating rate demand notes  called premiernotes 
the notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the duke energy premiernotes committee  or its designee  on a weekly basis 
the interest rate payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment 
the notes have no stated maturity date  but may be redeemed in whole or in part by duke energy at any time 
the notes are non transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part at the investor s option 
proceeds from the sale of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes 
the balance as of december  and december   is million and million  respectively 
the notes reflect a short term debt obligation of duke energy and are reflected as notes payable and commercial paper on duke energy s consolidated balance sheets 
in september  duke energy filed a form s with the sec 
under this form s  which is uncapped  duke energy  duke energy carolinas  duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may issue debt and other securities in the future at amounts  prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings 
the registration statement also allows for the issuance of common stock by duke energy 
duke energy has paid quarterly cash dividends for consecutive years and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future 
there is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the board of directors 
dividend and other funding restrictions of duke energy subsidiaries 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements regulatory matters  duke energy s wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to duke energy via dividend  advance or loan as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with duke energy s mergers with cinergy and progress energy 
progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and articles of incorporation which  in certain circumstances  limited their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock 
additionally  certain other duke energy subsidiaries have other restrictions  such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to duke energy 
at december   the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of duke energy that may not be distributed to duke energy in the form of a loan or dividend is billion 
however  duke energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts 
although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to duke energy  management does not believe these restrictions will have any significant impact on duke energy s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements duke energy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties 
these arrangements include performance guarantees  stand by letters of credit  debt guarantees  surety bonds and indemnifications 
most of the guarantee arrangements entered into by duke energy enhance the credit standing of certain subsidiaries  non consolidated entities or less than wholly owned entities  enabling them to conduct business 
as such  these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk  which are not included on the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility of duke energy  either on its own or on behalf of spectra energy capital  llc spectra capital through indemnification agreements entered into as part of the spin off of spectra energy corp spectra energy  having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries  investees and other third parties  or the occurrence of certain future events 
duke energy performs ongoing assessments of their respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased non performance risk by third parties for which duke energy has issued guarantees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  guarantees and indemnifications  for further details of the guarantee arrangements 
issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of duke energy s operations 
thus  if duke energy discontinued issuing these guarantees  there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
other than the guarantee arrangements discussed above and normal operating lease arrangements  duke energy does not have any material off balance sheet financing entities or structures 
for additional information on these commitments  see note to the consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies

part ii quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management policies 
the duke energy registrants are exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices  credit quality  interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
duke energy s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels 
the finance and risk management committee of the board of directors receives periodic updates from the chief risk officer and other members of management on market risk positions  corporate exposures  credit exposures and overall risk management activities 
the chief risk officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing credit risk and commodity price risk  including monitoring exposure limits 
the following disclosures about market risk contain forward looking statements that involve estimates  projections  goals  forecasts  assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
please review item a  risk factors  and safe harbor for forward looking statements for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
the risks discussed below do not include the price risks associated with nonfinancial instrument transactions and positions associated with the duke energy registrants operations  such as purchase and sales commitments and inventory 
commodity price risk the duke energy registrants are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets 
the duke energy registrants exposure to these fluctuations is limited by the cost based regulation of its us franchised electric and gas operations as these regulated operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost recovery clauses  including fuel clauses 
while there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered through rates  changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations 
at december   substantially all derivative commodity instrument positions were subject to regulatory accounting treatment 
price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities 
the duke energy registrants exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors  including contract size  length  market liquidity  location and unique or specific contract terms 
the duke energy registrants employ established policies and procedures to manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations  which may include using various commodity derivatives  such as swaps  futures  forwards and options 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  risk management  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
part ii validation of a contract s fair value is performed by an internal group separate from the duke energy registrants deal origination areas 
while the duke energy registrants use common industry practices to develop their valuation techniques  changes in their pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition 
hedging strategies 
the duke energy registrants closely monitor the risks associated with commodity price changes on their future operations and  where appropriate  use various commodity instruments such as electricity  coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations  in addition to optimizing the value of the non regulated generation portfolio 
duke energy s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against exposure to the prices of power and fuel 
the majority of instruments used to manage the duke energy registrants commodity price exposure are either not designated as a hedge or do not qualify for hedge accounting 
these instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts 
mark to market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
undesignated contracts entered into by unregulated businesses are marked to market each period  with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings 
certain derivatives used to manage the duke energy registrants commodity price exposure are accounted for as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
to the extent that instruments accounted for as hedges are effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact to the consolidated statements of operations until after delivery or settlement occurs 
accordingly  assumptions and valuation techniques for these contracts have no impact on reported earnings prior to settlement to the extent they are effective 
several factors influence the effectiveness of a hedge contract  including the use of contracts with different commodities or unmatched terms and counterparty credit risk 
hedge effectiveness is monitored regularly and measured at least quarterly 
in addition to the hedge contracts described above and recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  the duke energy registrants enter into other contracts that qualify for the npns exception 
when a contract meets the criteria to qualify as an npns  the duke energy registrants apply such exception 
income recognition and realization related to npns contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of power 
for contracts qualifying for the npns exception  no recognition of the contract s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring 
generation portfolio risks 
the duke energy registrants are primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of wholesale power  natural gas  and coal prices in the us franchised electric and gas and commercial power segments 
the duke energy registrants optimize the value of their wholesale and non regulated generation portfolios 
the portfolios include generation assets power and capacity  fuel  and emission allowances 
modeled forecasts of future generation output  fuel requirements  and emission allowance requirements are based on forward power  fuel and emission allowance markets 
the component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on models and forecasts of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategies of the business units 
for duke energy carolinas and duke energy indiana  as well as the kentucky regulated generation owned by duke energy ohio  the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations  although the impact on the consolidated statements of operations is partially offset by mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of net profits from these activities with retail customers 
duke energy ohio is subject to wholesale commodity price risks for its non regulated generation portfolio 
the non regulated generation portfolio dispatches all of their electricity into unregulated markets and receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues from pjm 
duke energy ohio has fully hedged its forecasted coal fired generation for capacity revenues are contracted in pjm through may international energy generally hedges its expected generation using long term bilateral power sales contracts when favorable market conditions exist and it is subject to wholesale commodity price risks for electricity not sold under such contracts 
international energy dispatches electricity not sold under long term bilateral contracts into unregulated markets and receives wholesale energy margins and capacity revenues from national system operators 
derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks for delivery periods beyond are also exposed to changes in fair value due to market price fluctuations of wholesale power  fuel oil and coal 
see sensitivity analysis for generation portfolio and derivative price risks below  for more information regarding the effect of changes in commodity prices on the duke energy registrants net income 
other commodity risks 
at december   pre tax income in was not expected to be materially impacted for exposures to other commodities price changes 
sensitivity analysis for generation portfolio and derivative price risks 
the table below summarizes the estimated effect of commodity price changes on the duke energy registrants pre tax net income  based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of december  and december  for duke energy and duke energy ohio 
forecasted exposure to commodity price risk for duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas  progress energy florida and duke energy indiana is not anticipated to have a material adverse effect on their consolidated results of operations in  based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of december  the sensitivity analysis performed as of december  related to forecasted exposure to commodity price risk during also indicated that commodity price risk would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations of duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas  progress energy florida and duke energy indiana during and the impacts of changing commodity prices in their consolidated results of operations for was insignificant 
the following commodity price sensitivity calculations consider existing hedge positions and estimated production levels  as indicated in the table below  but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices

b amounts represent sensitivities related to derivative contracts executed to manage generation portfolio risks for periods beyond amounts exclude the potential impact of commodity price changes on forecasted economic generation and fuel needed to achieve such forecasted generation 
part ii credit risk credit risk represents the loss that the duke energy registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations 
to reduce credit exposure  the duke energy registrants seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit them to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
the duke energy registrants attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable obtaining collateral or terminating or resetting the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events 
the duke energy registrants may  at times  use credit derivatives or other structures and techniques to provide for third party credit enhancement of their counterparties obligations 
the duke energy registrants also obtain cash or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements  where appropriate  based on a financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  risk management  derivative instruments and hedging activities  for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments 
the duke energy registrants industry has historically operated under negotiated credit lines for physical delivery contracts 
the duke energy registrants frequently use master collateral agreements to mitigate certain credit exposures 
the collateral agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold 
the threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement  determined in accordance with the duke energy registrants internal corporate credit practices and standards 
collateral agreements generally also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions 
the duke energy registrants principal customers for its electric and gas businesses are commodity clearinghouses  regional transmission organizations  industrial  commercial and residential end users  marketers  distribution companies  municipalities  electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the us and latin america 
the duke energy registrants have concentrations of receivables from such entities throughout these regions 
these concentrations of customers may affect the duke energy registrants overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector 
where exposed to credit risk  the duke energy registrants analyze the counterparties financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis 
duke energy carolinas has a third party insurance policy to cover certain losses related to its asbestos related injuries and damages above an aggregate self insured retention of million 
duke energy carolinas cumulative payments began to exceed the self insurance retention on its insurance policy during the second quarter of future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third party insurance carrier 
the insurance policy limit for potential future insurance recoveries for indemnification and medical cost claim payments is million in excess of the self insured retention 
insurance recoveries of million and million related to this policy are classified in the consolidated balance sheets in other within investments and other assets and receivables as of december  and  respectively 
duke energy carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims 
management believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating 
the duke energy registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance guarantees  letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties 
where the duke energy registrants have issued these guarantees  it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform 
where the duke energy registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale  they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  guarantees and indemnifications  for further information on guarantees issued by the duke energy registrants 
the duke energy registrants are also subject to credit risk of their vendors and suppliers in the form of performance risk on contracts including  but not limited to  outsourcing arrangements  major construction projects and commodity purchases 
the duke energy registrants credit exposure to such vendors and suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of non performance 
credit risk associated with the duke energy registrants service to residential  commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable 
the duke energy registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring customers to provide a cash deposit or letter of credit until a satisfactory payment history is established  subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction  at which time the deposit is typically refunded 
charge offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the duke energy registrants and are typically recovered through the retail rates 
management continually monitors customer charge offs and payment patterns to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves 
duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through crc  a duke energy consolidated variable interest entity 
losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of crc and next by the subordinated retained interests held by duke energy ohio  duke energy kentucky and duke energy indiana 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  variable interest entities 
based on the duke energy registrants policies for managing credit risk  their exposures and their credit and other reserves  the duke energy registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non performance by any counterparty 
european exposures 
at december   duke energy held million of money market funds and short term investments in investment grade debt securities issued by financial and nonfinancial institutions that are domiciled in europe or have exposures to european sovereign debt 
this amount is recorded at fair value and included in cash and cash equivalents and short term investment in the consolidated balance sheets 
a disorderly default by or withdrawal of a member nation from the euro zone and financial stress in other european countries could require duke energy to recognize an impairment of some or all of these securities 
part ii interest rate risk the duke energy registrants are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper 
the duke energy registrants manage interest rate exposure by limiting variable rate exposures to a percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the duke energy registrants also enter into financial derivative instruments  which may include instruments such as  but not limited to  interest rate swaps  swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure 
see notes    and to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  debt and credit facilities  risk management  derivative instruments and hedging activities  and fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
the table below summarizes the potential effect of interest rate changes on the duke energy registrants pre tax net income  based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of december  and december  summary of sensitivity analysis for interest rate risks assuming market interest rates average higher or lower in than assuming market interest rates average higher or lower in than in millions as of december  as of december  potential increase or decrease in interest expense a duke energy duke energy carolinas progress energy progress energy carolinas progress energy florida duke energy ohio duke energy indiana a amounts presented net of offsetting impacts in interest income 
these amounts were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable rate securities outstanding  adjusted for interest rate hedges  short term and long term investments  cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of december  and the change in interest rate sensitivity for the duke energy registrants is primarily due to changes in short term debt balances and cash balances 
if interest rates changed significantly  management would likely take actions to manage its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the duke energy registrants financial structure 
marketable securities price risk as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements  investments in debt and equity securities  duke energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations of the business 
the vast majority of the investments in equity securities are within the ndtf and assets of the various pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
pension plan assets 
duke energy and progress energy maintain investments to help fund the costs of providing non contributory defined benefit retirement and other post retirement benefit plans 
these investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates 
the equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment  sector or geographic region 
duke energy and progress energy have established asset allocation targets for their pension plan holdings  which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held 
these target allocations are presented in the table below 
asset target allocation equity securities debt securities other a significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require duke energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods  which could adversely affect cash flows of the duke energy registrants in those periods 
additionally  a decline in the fair value of plan assets  absent additional cash contributions to the plan  could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods  which could adversely affect the duke energy registrants results of operations in those periods 
contributions to qualified pension plans during are presented in the table below

as required by the nrc  ncuc  pscsc and the fpsc  duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities  debt securities  fixed income securities  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
per the nrc  ncuc  pscsc and fpsc requirements  these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning 
the investments in equity securities are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets 
the duke energy registrants actively monitor their portfolios by benchmarking the performance of their investments against certain indices and by maintaining  and periodically reviewing  target allocation percentages for various asset classes 
accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida s rates  therefore  fluctuations in equity prices do not affect their consolidated statements of operations as changes in the fair value of these investments are deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to an order by the ncuc  pscsc and fpsc 
earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through duke energy carolinas  progress energy carolinas and progress energy florida s rates

foreign currency risk duke energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity related transactions within domestic operations that are denominated in foreign currencies 
to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the us dollar inflation rates and or local inflation rates  or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency 
duke energy may also use foreign currency derivatives  where possible  to manage its risk related to foreign currency fluctuations 
to monitor its currency exchange rate risks  duke energy uses sensitivity analysis  which measures the impact of devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure 
in  duke energy s primary foreign currency rate exposure was to the brazilian real 
the table below summarizes the potential effect of foreign currency devaluations on duke energy s consolidated statement of operations and consolidated balance sheets  based on a sensitivity analysis performed as of december  and december  summary of sensitivity analysis for foreign currency risks assuming devaluation in the currency exchange rates in all exposure currencies in millions as of december  as of december  income statement impact a balance sheet impact b a amounts represent the potential annual net pre tax loss on the translation of local currency earnings to the consolidated statement of operations in and  respectively

in  the most recent year reported  carbon dioxide co  a byproduct of all sources of combustion  accounted for approximately percent of total us ghg emissions 
the duke energy registrants ghg emissions consist primarily of co and most come from its fleet of coal fired power plants in the us in  the duke energy registrants us power plants emitted approximately million tons of co the co emissions from duke energy s international electric operations were approximately million tons 
the duke energy registrants future co emissions will be influenced by variables including new regulations  economic conditions that affect electricity demand  and the duke energy registrants decisions regarding generation technologies deployed to meet customer electricity needs 
the duke energy registrants believe it is unlikely that legislation mandating reductions in ghg emissions or establishing a carbon tax will be passed by the th congress which began on january  beyond the prospects for enactment of any federal legislation mandating reductions in ghg emissions or establishing a carbon tax is highly uncertain 
given the high degree of uncertainty surrounding potential future federal ghg legislation  management cannot predict if or when such legislation might be enacted  what the requirements of any potential legislation might be  or the potential impact it might have on the duke energy registrants 
among the outcomes of the th conference of the parties of the united nations framework convention on climate change which concluded in december was an affirmation by the participating countries to complete negotiations on a new global agreement by that would take effect in the international climate change negotiating process is highly uncertain and management cannot predict what the outcome might be or the potential impact it might have on the duke energy registrants 
the duke energy registrants do not anticipate any of the states in which it currently operates fossil fueled electric generating units taking action absent a federal requirement to mandate reductions in ghg emissions from these facilities 
the duke energy registrants are taking actions today that will result in reduced ghg emissions over time 
these actions will lower the duke energy registrants exposure to any future mandatory ghg emission reduction requirements or carbon tax  whether a result of federal legislation or epa regulation 
under any future scenario involving mandatory ghg limitations  the duke energy registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms 
the duke energy registrants recognize that certain groups associate severe weather events with climate change  and forecast the possibility that these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity 
however  the uncertain nature of potential changes of extreme weather events such as increased frequency  duration  and severity  the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place  and the inability to predict these with any degree of accuracy  make estimating any potential future financial risk to the duke energy registrants operations that may result from the physical risks of potential changes in the frequency and or severity of extreme weather events  whatever the cause or causes might be  impossible 
currently  the duke energy registrants plan and prepare for extreme weather events that it experiences from time to time  such as ice storms  tornados  hurricanes  severe thunderstorms  high winds and droughts 
the duke energy registrants past experiences preparing for and responding to the impacts of these types of weather related events would reasonably be expected to help management plan and prepare for future severe weather events to reduce  but not eliminate  the operational  economic and financial impacts of such events 
for example  the duke energy registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on its electric distribution systems 
the duke energy registrants electric generating facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage 
the duke energy registrants maintain an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effects of any potential short term disruption in its fuel supply so it can continue to provide its customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity 
the duke energy registrants have a program in place to effectively manage the impact of future droughts on its operations 
other epa regulations recently published and under development the epa has issued and is in various stages of developing several non greenhouse gas non ghg environmental regulations that will affect the duke energy registrants 
these include the final mercury and air toxics standards mats for hazardous air pollutants  which is effective beginning in  as well as proposed regulations for cooling water intake structures under the clean water act b and proposed regulations for coal combustion residuals 
as a group  these non ghg environmental regulations will require the duke energy registrants to install additional environmental controls and accelerate retirement of some coal fired units 
while the ultimate regulatory requirements for the duke energy registrants from the group of epa regulatory actions will not be known until all the rules have been finalized  for planning purposes  the duke energy registrants currently estimate the cost of new control equipment that may need to be installed to comply with this group of rules could total billion to billion  excluding afudc  over the next years 
this range includes estimated costs for new control equipment necessary to comply with the mats of million to million 
the duke energy registrants also expect to incur increased fuel  purchased power  operation and maintenance  and other expenses in conjunction with the non ghg epa regulations 
in addition to the plant retirements associated with new generation the duke energy registrants are constructing  the duke energy registrants are planning to retire additional coal fired generating capacity that is not economic to bring into compliance with the epa s regulations 
beyond  total planned and potential retirements could exceed  mw of coal fired generating capacity 
the duke energy registrants would also expect to incur costs for replacement generation as a result of the potential coal fired power plant retirements 
until the final regulatory requirements of the group of epa regulations are known and can be fully evaluated  the potential compliance costs associated with these epa regulatory actions are subject to considerable uncertainty 
therefore  the actual compliance costs incurred and mw to be retired may be materially different from these estimates based on the timing and requirements of the final epa regulations

nuclear matters following the events at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in japan  duke energy conducted thorough inspections at each of its four nuclear sites during progress energy also conducted inspections in at each of its three sites 
the initial inspections have not identified any significant vulnerabilities  however  duke energy is reviewing designs to evaluate safety margins to external events 
emergency response capabilities  written procedures and engineering specifications were reviewed to verify each site s ability to respond in the unlikely event of station blackout 
duke energy is working within the nuclear industry to improve the safety standards and margin using the three layers of safety approach used in the us protection  mitigation and emergency response 
emergency equipment is currently being added at each station to perform key safety functions in the event that backup power sources are lost permanently 
these improvements are in addition to the numerous layers of safety measures and systems previously in place 
in march  the nrc formed a task force to conduct a comprehensive review of processes and regulations to determine whether the agency should make additional improvements to the nuclear regulatory system 
on july   the task force proposed a set of improvements designed to ensure protection  enhance accident mitigation  strengthen emergency preparedness and improve efficiency of nrc programs 
the recommendations part ii were further prioritized into three tiers based on the safety enhancement level 
on march   the nrc issued three regulatory orders requiring safety enhancements related to mitigation strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at a plant  ensuring reliable hardened containment vents and enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation 
in may  the nrc endorsed guidance on re evaluating emergency communications systems and staffing levels and performing seismic and flooding walkdowns 
on july   the nrc outlined plans for implementing tier and tier recommendations 
on august   the nrc issued implementation guidance to enable power plants to achieve compliance with the orders issued in march plants are then required to submit implementation plans to the nrc by february   and complete implementation of the safety enhancements within two refueling outages or by december   whichever comes first 
each plant is also required to reassess their seismic and flooding hazards using present day methods and information  conduct inspections to ensure protection against hazards in the current design basis  and re evaluate emergency communications systems and staffing levels 
duke energy is committed to compliance with all safety enhancements ordered by the nrc in connection with the march   regulatory orders noted above  the cost of which could be material 
until such time as the nrc mandated reassessment of flooding and seismic hazards is complete the exact scope and cost of compliance modifications to our sites will not be known 
with the nrc s continuing review of the remaining recommendations  duke energy cannot predict to what extent the nrc will impose additional licensing and safety related requirements  or the costs of complying with such requirements 
the tight time frame required to complete the necessary safety enhancements by no later than could lead to even higher costs 
upon receipt of additional guidance from the nrc and a collaborative industry review  duke energy will be able to determine an implementation plan and associated costs
