item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
dollars in thousands  except per share data general the company provides lightweighting and noise  vibration and harshness nvh solutions to automotive  commercial vehicle and other industrial markets through its imaginative thinking and advanced capabilities 
shiloh delivers these solutions through the design  engineering and manufacturing of first operation precision blanks  engineered welded blanks  complex stampings  modular assemblies  highly engineered aluminum die casting and machined components and its patented shilohcore acoustic laminate metal solution 
in addition  shiloh is a designer and engineer of precision tools and dies  welding and assembly equipment for use in its blanking  welded blank  stamping and die casting operations and for sale to original equipment manufacturers oems and  as a tier ii supplier  to tier i automotive part manufacturers who in turn supply oems 
the products that the company produces supply many models of vehicles manufactured by nearly all oems that produce vehicles in north america 
as a result  the company s revenues are heavily dependent upon the north american production of automobiles and light trucks of both the traditional domestic manufacturers  such as general motors  chrysler and ford  the asian oems defined as toyota  honda  renault nissan  hyundai and subaru and bmw  daimler  tesla and volkswagen 
according to industry statistics published by ihs automotive  production volumes for the years ended october  and october  were as follows year ended october  increase increase number of vehicles in thousands traditional domestic manufacturers asian oem other oem total another significant factor affecting the company s revenues is the company s ability to successfully bid on and win the production and supply of parts for models that will be newly introduced to the market by the oems 
these new model introductions typically go through a start of production phase with build levels that are higher than normal because the consumer supply network is filled to ensure adequate supply to the market  resulting in an increase in the company s revenues for related parts at the beginning of the cycle 
the company operates in an extremely competitive industry  driven by global vehicle production volumes 
business is typically awarded to the supplier offering the most favorable combination of cost  quality  technology and service 
customers continue to demand periodic cost reductions that require the company to assess  redefine and improve operations  products  and manufacturing capabilities to maintain and improve profitability 
management continues to develop and execute initiatives to meet challenges of the industry and to achieve its strategy for sustainable global profitable growth 
plant utilization levels are very important to profitability because of the capital intensive nature of the company s operations 
at october   the company s facilities were operating at approximately capacity  compared to capacity at october  the company defines full capacity as working hours per day and five days per week ie  shift operation 
utilization of capacity is dependent upon the releases against customer purchase orders that are used to establish production schedules and manpower and equipment requirements for each month and quarterly period of the fiscal year 
the significant majority of the steel purchased by the company s stamping and engineered welded blank operations is purchased through the customers resale steel programs 
under these programs  the customer negotiates the price for steel with the steel suppliers 
the company pays for the steel based on these negotiated prices and passes on those costs to the customer 
although the company takes ownership of the steel  the customers are responsible for all steel price fluctuations under these programs 
the company also purchases steel directly from domestic primary steel producers and steel service centers 
domestic steel pricing has generally been flat over the most recent quarters based on open capacity with the steel producers with nominal increases in demand 
the company blanks and processes steel for some of its customers on a toll processing basis 
under these arrangements  the company charges a tolling fee for the operations that it performs without acquiring ownership of the steel and being burdened with the attendant costs of ownership and risk of loss 
toll processing operations result in lower revenues but higher gross margins than operations where the company takes ownership of the steel 
revenues from operations involving directly owned steel include a component of raw material cost whereas toll processing revenues do not 
for the company aluminum die casting business  the cost of aluminum is handled in one of two ways 
the primary method used by the company is to secure quarterly aluminum purchase commitments based on customer releases and then pass the quarterly price changes to those customers utilizing published metal indexes 
the second method used by the company is to adjust prices monthly  based on a referenced metal index plus additional material cost spreads agreed to by the company and its customers 
engineered scrap metal is a planned by product of the company s processing operations and part of our quoted cost to each customer 
net proceeds from the disposition of scrap metal contribute to gross margin by offsetting the increases in the cost of metal and the attendant costs of quality and availability 
changes in the price of metal impact the company s results of operations because raw material costs are by far the largest component of cost of sales in processing directly owned metal 
the company actively manages its exposure to changes in the price of metal  and  in most instances  passes along the rising price of metal to its customers 
recent trends and general economic conditions affecting the automotive industry our business and operating results are directly affected by the relative strength of the north american automotive industry  which tends to be driven by macro economic factors that impact consumer income and confidence levels  housing sales  gasoline prices  automobile discount and incentive offers  and perceptions about global economic stability 
the automotive industry remains susceptible to these factors that effect consumer spending habits and could adversely impact consumer demand for vehicles 
the production of cars and light trucks for fiscal year in north america according to industry forecasts published by ihs automotive in november is currently predicted to increase to approximately  units  which reflects an improvement of over fiscal year s vehicle production of approximately  units 
the improved vehicle production reflects an improvement in economic conditions and consumer demand in north america 
the company continues its approach of monitoring closely the customer release volumes as the overall economic environment in north america reflects improvement and there is evidence that the us economy and its recovery is strengthening 
however  concerns over the us government fiscal policy issues could impact levels of unemployment and consumer confidence that could adversely impact consumer demand for vehicles 
critical accounting policies preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the following items as critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of the company s preceding financial statements 
these estimates were selected because of inherent imprecision that may result from applying judgment to the estimation process 
the expenses and accrued liabilities or allowances related to these policies are initially based on the company s best estimates at the time they are recorded 
adjustments are charged or credited to income and the related balance sheet account when actual experience differs from the expected experience underlying the estimates 
the company makes frequent comparisons of actual experience and expected experience in order to mitigate the likelihood that material adjustments will be required 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue both for sales from toll processing and sales of products made with company owned metal when there is evidence of a sales agreement  the delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of revenue is reasonably assured 
the company records revenues upon shipment of product to customers and transfer of title under standard commercial terms 
price adjustments  including those arising from resolution of quality issues  price and quantity discrepancies  surcharges for fuel and or steel and other commercial issues are recognized in the period when management believes that such amounts become probable  based on management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on several factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
additionally  a general allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical experience of write offs and the current financial condition of customers 
the financial condition of the company s customers is dependent on  among other things  the general economic environment  which may substantially change  thereby affecting the recoverability of amounts due to the company from its customers 
the company carefully assesses its risk with each of its customers and considers compliance with terms and conditions  aging of the customer accounts  intelligence learned through contact with customer representatives and its net account receivable account payable position with customers  if applicable  in establishing the allowance 
inventory reserves 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are used to determine cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns  and in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
the company values inventories on a regular basis to identify inventories on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  the company provides a reserve for the full value of the inventory  net of estimated realizable value 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates future demand 
additional inventory reserves may be required if actual market conditions differ from management s expectations 
the company continues to monitor purchases of inventory to insure that receipts coincide with shipments  thereby reducing the economic risk of holding excessive levels of inventory that could result in long holding periods or in unsalable inventory leading to losses in conversion 
income taxes 
the company utilizes the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes 
income tax expense includes us and international income taxes minus tax credits and other incentives that will reduce tax expense in the year they are claimed 
deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial accounting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company assesses both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence typically assessed includes the operating results for the most recent three year period and  to a lesser extent because of inherent uncertainty  the expectations of future profitability  available tax planning strategies  the time period over which the temporary differences will reverse and taxable income in prior carryback years if carryback is permitted under the tax law 
the calculation of the company s tax liabilities also involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on the company s estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be required 
the company reports interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income taxes 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company has historically performed an annual impairment analysis of long lived assets 
however  when significant events  which meet the definition of a triggering event in the context of assessing asset impairments  occur within the industry or within the company s primary customer base  an interim impairment analysis is performed 
the analysis consists of reviewing the next five years outlook for sales  profitability  and cash flow for each of the company s manufacturing plants and for the overall company 
the five year outlook considers known sales opportunities for which purchase orders exist  potential sale opportunities that are under development  third party forecasts of north american car builds published by ihs automotive  and the potential sales that could result from new manufacturing process additions and lastly  strategic geographic localities that are important to servicing the automotive industry 
all of this data is collected as part of our annual planning process and is updated with more current company specific and industry data when an interim period impairment analysis is deemed necessary 
in concluding the impairment analysis  the company incorporates a sensitivity analysis by probability weighting the achievement of the forecasted cash flows by plant and achievements of cash flows that are greater and less than the forecasted amounts 
the property  plant and equipment included in the analysis for each plant represents factory facilities devoted to the company s manufacturing processes and the related equipment within each plant needed to perform and support those processes 
the property  plant and equipment of each plant form each plant s asset group and typically certain key assets in the group form the primary processes at that plant that generate revenue and cash flow for that facility 
certain key assets have a life of ten to twelve years and the remainder of the assets in the asset group are shorter lived assets that support the key processes 
when the analysis indicates that estimated future undiscounted cash flows of a plant are less than the net carrying value of the long lived assets of such plant  to the extent that the assets cannot be redeployed to another plant to generate positive cash flow  the company will record an impairment charge  reducing the net carrying value of the fixed assets exclusive of land and buildings  the fair value of which would be assessed through appraisals to zero 
alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset group are typically not considered due to the limited use nature of the equipment and the full utilization of their useful life 
therefore  the equipment is of limited value in a used equipment market 
the depreciable lives of the company s fixed assets are generally consistent between years unless the assets are devoted to the manufacture of a customized automotive part and the equipment has limited reapplication opportunities 
if the production of that part concludes earlier than expected  the asset life is shortened to fully amortize its remaining value over the shortened production period 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events 
such events may include  but are not limited to  significant industry or economic trends and strategic decisions made in response to changes in the economic and competitive conditions impacting the company s business 
based on the current facts  the company recorded an impairment charge related to long lived assets of in the fourth quarter of fiscal and  in the third quarter of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges recorded in fiscal and fiscal the company continues to assess impairment to long lived assets based on expected orders from the company s customers and current business conditions 
the key assumptions related to the company s forecasted operating results could be adversely impacted by  among other things  decreases in estimated north american car builds during the forecast period  the inability of the company or its major customers to maintain their respective forecasted market share positions  the inability of the company to achieve the forecasted levels of operating margins on parts produced  and a deterioration in property values associated with manufacturing facilities 
intangible assets 
intangible assets with definitive lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definitive lives on a straight line basis over periods ranging from months to fifteen years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the current intangible assets and their estimated amortization expense 
amortization of trade names  trademarks  developed technologies  customer relationships and non compete agreements is included within selling  general  and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
goodwill 
goodwill  which represents the excess cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired  was approximately  as of october   or of our total assets 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
such assessment can be done on a qualitative or quantitative basis 
to qualitatively assess the liklihood of goodwill being impaired  we consider the following factors at the reporting unit level the excess of fair value over carrying value as of the last impairment test  the length of time since the last fair value measurement  the carrying value  market and industry metrics  actual performance compared to forecasted performance  and our current outlook on the business 
if the qualitative assessment indicated it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired  we will perform quantitative impairment testing at the reporting unit level 
to quantitatively test goodwill for impairment  we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and compare the fair value to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  then a possible impairment of goodwill may exist and further evaluation is required 
fair values are based on the cash flow projected in the reporting units strategic plans and long range planning forecasts  discounted at a risk adjusted rate of return 
revenue growth rates included in the plans are generally based on industry specific data and known awarded business 
the projected profit margins assumptions included in the plans are based in the current cost structure and anticipated productivity improvements 
if different assumptions were used in the plans  the related cash flows used in measuring fair value could be different and impairment of goodwill might be required to be recorded 
group insurance and workers compensation accruals 
the company is primarily self insured for group insurance and workers compensation claims and reviews these accruals on a monthly basis to adjust the balances as determined necessary 
the company is fully insured for workers compensation at one of its locations 
for the self insured plans  the company reviews historical claims data and lag analysis as the primary indicators of the accruals 
additionally  the company reviews specific large insurance claims to determine whether there is a need for additional accrual on a case by case basis 
changes in the claim lag periods and the specific occurrences could materially impact the required accrual balance period to period 
the company carries excess insurance coverage for group insurance and workers compensation claims exceeding a range of and per plan year  respectively  dependent upon the location where the claim is incurred 
at october  and  the amount accrued for group insurance and workers compensation claims was  and  respectively 
the self insurance reserves established are a result of safety statistics  changes in employment levels  number of open and active workers compensation cases  and group insurance plan design features 
the company does not self insure for any other types of losses 
share based payments 
the company records compensation expense for the fair value of nonvested stock option awards and restricted stock awards over the remaining vesting period 
the company has elected to use the simplified method to calculate the expected term of the stock options outstanding at five to six years and has utilized historical weighted average volatility 
the company determines the volatility and risk free rate assumptions used in computing the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  in consultation with an outside third party 
the expected term for the restricted stock award is between one to four years 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based award and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used are management s best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  the recorded stock based compensation expense could have been materially different from that depicted in the financial statements 
in addition  the company has estimated a forfeiture rate 
if actual forfeitures materially differ from the estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
the restricted stock was valued based upon the closing date of the grant of the stock 
in addition  the company has estimated a forfeiture rate since the restricted stock was granted to the president and chief executive officer 
pension and other post retirement costs and liabilities 
the company has recorded significant pension and other post retirement benefit liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
the determination of the company s pension liabilities requires key assumptions regarding discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefit payments and the expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate is also significant to the development of other post retirement liabilities 
the company determines these assumptions in consultation with  and after input from  its actuaries 
the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which the pension and other post retirement liabilities could be settled at the end of the year 
the company uses the principal pension discount yield curve principal curve as the basis for determining the discount rate for reporting pension and retiree medical liabilities 
the principal curve has several advantages to other methods  including transparency of construction  lower statistical errors  and continuous forward rates for all years 
at october   the resulting discount rate from the use of the principal curve was  an increase of from a year earlier that resulted in a decrease of the benefit obligation of approximately  a change of basis points in the discount rate at october  would increase or decrease expense on an annual basis by approximately the assumed long term rate of return on pension assets is applied to the market value of plan assets to derive a reduction to pension expense that approximates the expected average rate of asset investment return over ten or more years 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return will increase pension expense whereas an increase in the expected long term rate will reduce pension expense 
decreases in the level of plan assets will serve to increase the amount of pension expense whereas increases in the level of actual plan assets will serve to decrease the amount of pension expense 
any shortfall in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will increase pension expense in future years due to the amortization of the shortfall  whereas any excess in the actual return on plan assets from the expected return will reduce pension expense in future periods due to the amortization of the excess 
a change of basis points in the assumed rate of return on pension assets would increase or decrease pension assets by approximately the company s investment policy for assets of the plans is to maintain an allocation generally of to in equity securities  to in debt securities  and to in real estate 
equity security investments are structured to achieve an equal balance between growth and value stocks 
the company determines the annual rate of return on pension assets by first analyzing the composition of its asset portfolio 
historical rates of return are applied to the portfolio 
the company s investment advisors and actuaries review this computed rate of return 
industry comparables and other outside guidance are also considered in the annual selection of the expected rates of return on pension assets 
for the twelve months ended october   the actual return on pension plans assets for all of the company s plans approximated  which is above the expected rate of return on plan assets of used to derive pension expense 
the long term expected rate of return takes into account years with exceptional gains and years with exceptional losses 
actual results that differ from these estimates may result in more or less future company funding into the pension plans than is planned by management 
based on current market investment performance  the company anticipates that contributions to the company s defined benefit plans will decrease in fiscal  and that pension expense will decrease in fiscal results of operations year ended october  compared to year ended october  revenues 
sales for fiscal were  an increase of  over fiscal of  or 
of the increased sales  approximately  came from an increase in the production volumes of the north american car and light truck manufacturers along with the sales from new program awards launched during the fiscal year

new accounting standards in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december  the new accounting rules require all us public companies to report the effect of items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items of net income  net of tax  either on the face of the financial statements where net income is presented or in a tabular format in the notes to the financial statements 
effective february   the company adopted asu no 
the new accounting rules expand the disclosure of other comprehensive income and had no impact on the company results of operations and financial condition
