critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue billed in advance for monitoring and management services is deferred until the revenue has been earned  which is when the related services have been performed 
other service revenue  including amounts passed through based on surcharges from our telecom carriers  related to the network services and collaboration services are recognized as service is provided 
as the non refundable  upfront installation and activation fees charged to the subscribers do not meet the criteria as a separate unit of accounting  they are deferred and recognized over the to month period estimated life of the customer relationship 
revenue related to professional services is recognized at the time the services are performed  and presented as required by asc topic revenue recognition 
revenues derived from other sources are recognized when services are provided or events occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that are believed to be uncollectible 
we also record additional allowances based on our aged receivables  which are determined based on historical experience and an assessment of the general financial conditions affecting our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowance may be required 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
we do not obtain collateral from our customers to secure accounts receivable 
long lived assets 
we evaluate impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations  primarily fixed assets  when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable as required by asc topic property  plant and equipment 
for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are compared to the carrying amounts of those assets 
if and when the carrying values of the assets exceed their fair values  then the related assets will be written down to fair value 
no impairment losses were recorded during and except for the amounts discussed below under capitalized software costs 
capitalized software costs 
the company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software 
all software development costs have been appropriately accounted for as required by asc topic intangible goodwill and other internal use software 
capitalized software costs are included in property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over three to four years 
software costs that do not meet capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred 
during we recorded an impairment loss of  for certain costs previously capitalized 
no related impairment losses were recorded during goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with asc topic intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the test for impairment will be conducted annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value of the goodwill may be below its carrying amount 
the company determined that no events occurred or circumstances changed during the three months ended december  that would indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be below its carrying amount 
however  if market conditions deteriorate  or if the company is unable to execute on its strategies  it may be necessary to record impairment charges in the future 
intangible assets 
intangible assets include acquired customer relationships  affiliate network and trademarks 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from five years to twelve years in accordance with asc topic intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this standard is effective for annual interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
this standard provides for an optional qualitative assessment for the testing of indefinite lived intangible asset impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that such asset is impaired 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with its carrying value 
otherwise  the quantitative impairment test is not required 
the company adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements
