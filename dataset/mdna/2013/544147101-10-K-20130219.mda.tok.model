part i item business overview lorillard is the third largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the united states 
founded in  lorillard is the oldest continuously operating tobacco company in the united states 
newport  our flagship premium cigarette brand  is the top selling menthol and second largest selling cigarette brand overall in the united states based on gross units sold in the newport brand  which includes both menthol and non menthol product offerings  accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended december  in addition to the newport brand  our product line has four additional brand families marketed under the kent  true  maverick  and old gold brand names 
these five brands include different product offerings which vary in price  taste  flavor  length and packaging 
in  we shipped billion cigarettes  all of which were sold in the united states and certain us possessions and territories 
lorillard  through its loec  inc subsidiary  is also a leading electronic cigarette company in the us  marketed under the blu ecigs brand following its acquisition of blu ecigs and other assets used in the manufacture  distribution  development  research  marketing  advertising and sale of electronic cigarettes on april  newport  kent  true  maverick  old gold and blu ecigs are the registered trademarks of lorillard and its subsidiaries 
we sold our major cigarette trademarks outside of the united states in we maintain our headquarters and manufacture all of our cigarette products in greensboro  north carolina 
we produce cigarettes for both the premium and discount segments of the domestic cigarette market 
we do not compete in a subcategory of the discount segment that we identify as the deep discount segment 
premium brands are well known  established brands marketed at higher retail prices 
discount brands are generally less 
table of contents well recognized brands marketed at lower retail prices 
we define the deep discount subcategory to include brands sold at the lowest retail prices 
deep discount cigarettes are typically manufactured by smaller companies  relative to us and other major us manufacturers  many of which have no  or significantly lower  payment obligations under the master settlement agreement among major tobacco manufacturers and states and various other governments and jurisdictions the msa and the settlements of similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota  collectively the state settlement agreements 
advertising and sales promotion the predominant form of promotion in the industry and for us consists of retail price reduction programs  such as discounting or lowering the price of a pack or carton of cigarettes in the retail store 
these programs are developed  implemented and executed by our sales force through merchandising or promotional agreements with retail chain accounts and independent retailers 
we focus our retail programs in markets and stores reflecting unique potential for increased menthol cigarette sales 
our direct buying wholesale customers provide us with information as to the quantities of cigarettes shipped to their retail accounts on a weekly basis 
this data covers approximately of domestic wholesale units shipped by us and our major competitors  and enables us to analyze  plan and execute retail promotion programs in markets and stores that optimize the most efficient and effective return on our promotional investments 
we employ other promotion methods to communicate with our adult consumers as well as with adult smokers of our competitors products 
these promotional programs include the use of direct marketing communications  retail coupons  relationship marketing and promotional materials intended to be displayed at retail 
relationship marketing entails the use of various communication techniques to directly reach adult consumers in order to establish a relationship with them for the purpose of advertising and promoting a product or products 
we use our proprietary database of adult smokers of our brands and our competitors brands to deliver targeted communications about a given brand through age restricted direct mail and internet programs 
we regularly review the results of our promotional spending activities and adjust our promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain our competitive position 
accordingly  sales promotion costs in any particular fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of costs that may be realized in subsequent periods 
advertising plays a relatively lesser role in our overall marketing strategy for cigarettes 
we advertise newport in a limited number of magazines that meet certain requirements regarding the age and composition of their readership 
newport is our only cigarette brand that receives magazine advertising support 
advertising of cigarettes through television and radio has been prohibited since under the state settlement agreements  the participating cigarette manufacturers agreed to severe restrictions on their advertising and promotion activities including  among other things prohibiting the targeting of youth in the advertising  promotion or marketing of cigarettes  banning the use of cartoon characters in all cigarette advertising and promotion  limiting each cigarette manufacturer to one brand name event sponsorship during any twelve month period  which may not include major team sports or events in which the intended audience includes a significant percentage of youth  banning all outdoor advertising of cigarettes with the exception of small signs at retail establishments that sell tobacco products  banning cigarette manufacturers from offering or selling apparel and other merchandise that bears a cigarette brand name  subject to specified exceptions  prohibiting the distribution of free samples of cigarettes except within adult only facilities  
table of contents prohibiting payments for cigarette placement in various media  and banning gift offers based on the purchase of cigarettes without sufficient proof that the intended gift recipient is an adult 
in june  the federal family smoking prevention and tobacco control act the fsptca was enacted granting authority over the regulation of certain tobacco products to the fda  excluding electronic cigarettes 
pursuant to the fsptca  the fda reissued a set of marketing and sales restrictions originally promulgated in as part of an unsuccessful effort by the agency to assert jurisdiction over certain tobacco products 
the fsptca also contains other restrictions  some of which may be more stringent than those found in the original fda rule  affecting the advertising  marketing and sale of cigarette products 
see the section entitled legislation and regulation below for additional information concerning the marketing and sales provisions of the fsptca 
in addition  many states  cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further restricting cigarette advertising  marketing and sales promotions  and others may do so in the future 
we cannot predict the impact of such initiatives on our marketing and sales efforts 
we fund a youth smoking prevention program  which is designed to discourage youth from smoking by promoting parental involvement and assisting parents in discussing the issue of smoking with their children 
we are also a founding member of the coalition for responsible tobacco retailing which through its we card program trains retailers in how to prevent the purchase of cigarettes by underage persons 
in addition  we have adopted guidelines established by the national association of attorneys general to restrict advertising in magazines with large readership among people under the age of electronic cigarettes are generally less regulated than cigarettes 
accordingly  a wider variety of marketing programs are available 
the predominant forms of advertising and promotion in the electronic cigarette industry are television  print advertising  sampling events and web based advertising 
loec requires all purchasers of its electronic cigarettes to be at least years of age 
during  the fda indicated that it intends to regulate electronic cigarettes under the fsptca through the issuance of deeming regulations that would include electronic cigarettes under the definition of a tobacco product under the fsptca subject to the fda s jurisdiction 
as of february   the fda had not taken such action 
customers and distribution our field sales personnel are based throughout the united states  and we maintain field sales offices throughout the united states 
our sales department is divided into regions based on geography and sales territories 
we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors  who in turn service retail outlets  chain store organizations  and government agencies  including the us armed forces 
upon completion of the manufacturing process  we ship cigarettes to public distribution warehouse facilities for rapid order fulfillment to wholesalers and other direct buying customers 
we retain a portion of our manufactured cigarettes at our greensboro central distribution center and greensboro cold storage facility for future finished goods replenishment 
as of december   we had approximately direct buying customers servicing more than  retail accounts for our cigarettes 
we do not sell cigarettes directly to consumers 
during  and  sales made by us to the mclane company  inc comprised  and  respectively  of our revenues 
no other customer accounted for more than of  or cigarette revenues 
we do not have any written sales agreements with our customers  including the mclane company  inc that provide for any backlog orders 
most of our customers buy cigarettes on a next day delivery basis 
customer orders are shipped from public distribution warehouses via third party carriers 
we do not ship products directly to retail stores 
in  
table of contents approximately of our customers purchased cigarettes using electronic funds transfer  which provides immediate payment to us 
as of december   we had approximately direct buying customers providing blu ecigs electronic cigarettes to more than  retail accounts 
we also sell electronic cigarettes directly to consumers over the internet 
we do not have any written sales agreements with our customers that provide for any backlog orders for electronic cigarettes 
customer orders are shipped primarily from a public distribution warehouse via third party carriers 
raw materials and manufacturing in our production of cigarettes  we use domestic and foreign grown burley and flue cured leaf tobaccos  as well as aromatic tobaccos grown primarily in turkey and other near eastern countries 
we believe that there is an adequate supply of leaf tobacco of the type and quality we require at competitive prices from a combination of global sources  and that we are not dependent on any one geographic region or country for our requirements 
an affiliate of reynolds american inc rai manufactures all of our reconstituted tobacco pursuant to our specifications  as set forth in the agreement between us and rai 
reconstituted tobacco is a form of tobacco material manufactured as a paper like sheet from small pieces of tobacco that are too small to incorporate into the cigarette directly and may include some tobacco stems  and which is used as a component of cigarette blends 
we purchase our leaf tobacco through tobacco dealers  which contract with leaf growers 
such purchases are made at prevailing market prices in the country of origin 
due to the varying size and quality of annual crops  changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other foreign currencies and other economic factors  tobacco prices have historically fluctuated 
we direct these dealers in the purchase of tobacco according to our specifications for quality  grade  yield  particle size  moisture content  and other characteristics 
the dealers purchase and process the whole leaf and then dry and package it for shipment to and storage at our danville  virginia facility 
we have not experienced any difficulty in purchasing our requirement of leaf tobacco 
we purchased approximately  and of our leaf tobacco from one dealer  alliance one international  inc alliance one in  and if alliance one becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to us  we believe that we can readily obtain high quality leaf tobacco from well established  alternative industry sources 
however  we believe that such high quality leaf tobacco may not be available at prices comparable to those we pay to alliance one 
we store our tobacco in storage warehouses on our acre danville  virginia facility 
to protect against loss  amounts of all types and grades of tobacco are stored in separate warehouses 
certain types of tobacco used in our blends must be allowed to mature over time to allow natural chemical changes that enhance certain characteristics affecting taste 
because of these aging requirements  we maintain large quantities of leaf tobacco at all times 
we believe our current tobacco inventories are sufficient and adequately balanced for our present and expected production requirements 
if necessary  we can typically purchase aged tobacco in the open market to supplement existing inventories 
we produce cigarettes at our greensboro  north carolina manufacturing plant  which has a production capacity of approximately million cigarettes per day and approximately billion cigarettes per year 
through various automated systems and sensors  we actively monitor all phases of production to promote quality and compliance with applicable regulations 
all raw materials used in the manufacture of our electronic cigarettes  with the exception of the liquid flavorings  are produced by various suppliers located in asia 
the liquid flavorings used in our electronic cigarettes  which have varieties with and without nicotine  are manufactured in the us and exported to asian based manufacturers 
all of our electronic cigarettes are manufactured and assembled in asia and imported to the us 

table of contents research and development we have an experienced research and development team that continuously evaluates new products and line extensions and assesses new technologies and scientific advancements to be able to respond to marketplace demands and developing regulatory requirements 
our research and development efforts focus primarily on developing quality products that appeal to adult consumers  studying and developing consumer acceptable products with the potential for reduced exposure to smoke constituents or reduced health risk  improving the quality and consistency of existing electronic cigarette products  developing advancements in electronic cigarette technology aimed at improving consumer acceptability and realizing the potential for harm reduction compared to cigarette products  identifying and investigating  through the use of internal and external resources  suspect constituents of cigarette products or their components to determine the feasibility of reduction or elimination  maintaining state of the art knowledge about public health and scientific issues related to cigarettes and electronic cigarettes  developing new  or modifying existing  products and processes to promote quality control and to comply with current and anticipated laws and regulations  and collaborating and cooperating with public and private scientific institutions and encouraging independent research relating to cigarettes and electronic cigarettes 
tobacco related research activities include the analysis of cigarette components  including cigarette paper  filters  tobacco and ingredients  including menthol  analysis of mainstream and sidestream smoke  and modification of cigarette design 
we employ advanced scientific equipment in our research efforts  including gas chromatographs  mass spectrographs and liquid chromatographs 
we use this equipment to structurally identify and measure the amount of chemical compounds found in cigarette smoke and various tobaccos 
these measurements allow us to better understand the relationship between the tobacco  cigarette construction  and the smoke yielded from cigarettes 
in addition  advanced biological techniques are developed and used to test the biological impact of tobacco smoke on cells and advance our understanding of potential biomarkers for disease risk 
information technology we are committed to the use of information technology throughout the organization to provide operating effectiveness  cost reduction and competitive advantages 
we believe our system platform provides the appropriate level of information in a timely fashion to effectively manage the business 
we utilize proven technologies while also continuously exploring new technologies consistent with our information technology architecture strategy 
our information technology environment is anchored by an sap enterprise resource planning erp system designed to meet the processing and analysis needs of our core business operations and financial control requirements 
the process control and production methods in our manufacturing operation utilize scanning  radio frequency identification  wireless technologies and software products to monitor and control the manufacturing process 
our primary data center is located at our corporate headquarters and is staffed by an in house team of experienced information technology professionals 
a satellite data center  located at our cigarette manufacturing facility  supports our manufacturing environment 
in addition  we have a comprehensive redundancy and disaster recovery plan in place 
employees as of december   we had approximately  full time employees 
as of that date  approximately  of those employees were represented by labor unions covered by two collective bargaining agreements 

table of contents local union t greensboro of the bakery  confectionery  tobacco workers and grain millers international union afl cio clc represents workers at our greensboro cigarette manufacturing plant 
in august  a new collective bargaining agreement covering this union was approved  which expires in september workers at our danville  virginia tobacco storage facility are also represented by local union t danville of the bakery  confectionery  tobacco workers and grain millers international union afl cio clc 
in march  a new collective bargaining agreement covering local union t of danville was approved  which expires in april we have historically had an amicable relationship with the unions representing our employees 
we provide a retirement plan  a profit sharing plan and other benefits for our hourly paid employees who are represented by unions 
in addition  we provide to our salaried employees a retirement plan  group life  disability and health insurance program and a savings plan 
we also maintain an incentive compensation plan for certain salaried employees  and an employee stock purchase plan under which certain full time employees may purchase shares of lorillard common stock 
intellectual property we believe that our trademarks  including brand names  are important to our business 
we own the patents  trade secrets  know how and trademarks  including our brand names and the distinctive packaging and displays  used by us in our business 
all of our material trademarks are registered with the us patent and trademark office 
rights in these trademarks in the united states will continue indefinitely as long as we continue to use the trademarks 
we consider the blends of tobacco and the flavor formulas used to make our brands to be trade secrets 
these trade secrets are generally not the subject of patents  though various manufacturing processes are patented 
we sold the international rights to substantially all of our major cigarette brands  including newport  in competition the domestic market for cigarettes is highly competitive 
competition is primarily based on a brand s taste  quality  price  including the level of discounting and other promotional activities  positioning  consumer loyalty  and retail display 
our principal competitors are the two other major us cigarette manufacturers  philip morris usa inc philip morris  a subsidiary of altria group  inc and rj reynolds tobacco company rjr tobacco  a subsidiary of rai 
we also compete with numerous other smaller manufacturers and importers of cigarettes 
we believe our ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained in some marketing areas as a result of retail merchandising contracts offered by philip morris and rjr tobacco which limit the retail shelf space available to our brands 
as a result  in some retail locations we are limited in competitively supporting our promotional programs  which may constrain sales 
the market for electronic cigarettes is evolving at a very fast pace and is very fragmented  with many smaller companies competing with similar product offerings 
in the competition for retail presence  blu ecigs has begun the process of differentiating itself from the competition with unique technology  impactful displays and point of sale materials 
the method of distribution for many competing companies is predominately over the internet  with only a small number of competitors currently having a significant presence at retail 
please read the sections entitled item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment and selected industry and domestic cigarette retail market share data beginning on pages and  respectively  for additional information 

table of contents legislation and regulation our business operations are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing  among other things  the research  development and manufacture of cigarettes  the development of new tobacco products  the publication of health warnings on cigarette packaging and advertising  the marketing and sale of tobacco products  restrictions on smoking in public places  and fire safety standards 
from time to time  new legislation and regulations are proposed and reports are published by government sponsored committees and others recommending additional regulation of tobacco products 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proposals  reports and recommendations 
if they are enacted or implemented  certain of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition or results of operations in the future 
federal regulation the federal comprehensive smoking education act  which became effective in  requires that cigarette packaging and advertising display one of the following four warning statements  on a rotating basis surgeon general s warning smoking causes lung cancer  heart disease  emphysema  and may complicate pregnancy 
surgeon general s warning quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health 
surgeon general s warning smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury  premature birth  and low birth weight 
surgeon general s warning cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide 
this law also requires that each company that manufactures  packages or imports cigarettes shall annually provide to the secretary of health and human services a list of the ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes 
this list of ingredients may be submitted in a manner that does not identify the company that uses the ingredients or the brand of cigarettes that contain the ingredients 
in addition  bills have been introduced in congress  including those that would prohibit all tobacco advertising and promotion  authorize the establishment of various anti smoking education programs  provide that current federal law should not be construed to relieve any person of liability under common or state law  permit state and local governments to restrict the sale and distribution of cigarettes  direct the placement of advertising of tobacco products  provide that cigarette advertising not be deductible as a business expense  restrict the sale or distribution of cigarettes in retail stores  by mail or over the internet  impose additional  or increase existing  excise taxes on cigarettes  and require that cigarettes be manufactured in a manner that will cause them  under certain circumstances  to be self extinguishing 
in june  the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act was enacted granting the food and drug administration fda authority to regulate tobacco products 
as it relates to cigarettes  the legislation establishes a tobacco products scientific advisory committee to  among other things  evaluate the issues surrounding the use of menthol as a flavoring or ingredient in cigarettes and issue a nonbinding recommendation to the fda regarding menthol  
table of contents grants the fda the regulatory authority to consider and impose broad additional restrictions through a rule making process  including a ban on the use of menthol in cigarettes  requires larger and more severe health warnings  including graphic images  on cigarette packs  cartons  and advertising  bans the use of descriptors on cigarettes  such as low tar and light  bans the distribution of free samples of cigarettes  requires the disclosure of cigarette ingredients and additives to consumers  requires pre market approval by the fda of all new cigarette products  including substantially equivalent products  requires pre market approval by the fda for all claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products  allows the fda to review existing products to determine whether these products are substantially equivalent to other products in the market  allows the fda to require the reduction of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes  allows the fda to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in cigarettes  allows the fda to place more severe restrictions on the advertising  marketing and sales of cigarettes  and permits inconsistent state regulation of the advertising or promotion of cigarettes and eliminates the existing federal preemption of such regulation 
the legislation permits the fda to impose restrictions regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes  including a ban  if those restrictions would be appropriate for the public health 
any ban or material limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
it is possible that such additional regulation  including regulation of menthol short of a ban thereof  could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the united states including sales of our brands  increased costs to us  and or the development of a significant black market for cigarettes  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
during  the fda indicated that it intends to regulate electronic cigarettes under the fsptca through the issuance of deeming regulations that would include electronic cigarettes under the definition of a tobacco product under the fsptca subject to the fda s jurisdiction 
as of february   the fda had not taken such action 
we cannot predict the scope of such regulations or the impact they may have on our electronic cigarette business  though if enacted  they could have a material adverse effect on our electronic cigarette business in the future 
environmental tobacco smoke various publications and studies by governmental entities have reported that environmental tobacco smoke ets  also called second hand smoke  presents health risks 
in addition  public health organizations have issued statements on the adverse health effects of ets  and scientific papers have been published that address the health problems associated with ets exposure 
various states  cities and municipalities have restricted public smoking in recent years  and these restrictions have been based at least in part on the publications regarding the health risks believed to be associated with ets exposure 
the governmental entities that have published these reports have included the surgeon general of the united states  first with a report focused on the health risks of ets in and again in the report  for instance  concluded that there is no risk free level of exposure to ets 
in  the department of health and human services listed ets as a known human carcinogen 
in  the us environmental protection agency concluded that ets is a human lung carcinogen in adults and causes respiratory effects in children 
the surgeon general also addressed the health risks of ets in the report of the surgeon general on how tobacco 
table of contents smoke causes disease the biology and behavioral basis for smoking attributable disease surgeon general report 
agencies of state governments also have issued publications regarding ets  including reports by california entities that were published in  and in the study  the california air resources board determined that ets is a toxic air contaminant 
based on these or other findings  public health concerns regarding ets have lead and could continue to lead to the imposition of additional restrictions on public smoking  including bans  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows in the future 
state and local regulation many state  local and municipal governments and agencies  as well as private businesses  have adopted legislation  regulations or policies which prohibit or restrict  or are intended to discourage  smoking  including legislation  regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in various places such as public buildings and facilities  stores  restaurants and bars and on airline flights and in the workplace 
this trend has increased significantly since the release of the epa s report regarding ets in two states  massachusetts and texas  have enacted legislation requiring each manufacturer of cigarettes sold in those states to submit an annual report identifying for each brand sold certain added constituents  and providing nicotine yield ratings and other information for certain brands 
neither law allows for the public release of trade secret information 
a new york law which became effective in june requires cigarettes sold in that state to meet a mandated standard for ignition propensity 
we developed proprietary technology to comply with the standards and were compliant by the effective date 
since the passage of the new york law  an additional states and the district of columbia have passed similar laws utilizing the same technical standards 
the effective dates of these laws range from may to january beginning november   all of our cigarettes were manufactured using this technology 
other similar laws and regulations have been enacted or considered by other state and local governments and may include electronic cigarettes as well as cigarettes 
we cannot predict the impact which these regulations may have on our business  though if enacted  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows in the future 
excise taxes and assessments cigarettes are subject to substantial federal  state and local excise taxes in the united states and  in general  such taxes have been increasing

table of contents item a 
risk factors fda regulation of menthol in cigarettes and concerns that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks could adversely affect our business 
some plaintiffs in our litigation and constituencies  including the fda and other public health agencies  have claimed or expressed concerns that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks and may impact public health more than non mentholated cigarettes  including concerns that mentholated cigarettes may make it easier to start smoking and harder to quit  and may seek restrictions or a ban on the production and sale of mentholated cigarettes 
any ban or material limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow and financial condition 
following the passage of the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act the act in june  the fda established the tobacco products scientific advisory committee the tpsac to evaluate  among other things  the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health  including such use among children  african americans  hispanics  and other racial and ethnic minorities 
in addition  the act permits the fda to impose restrictions regarding the use of menthol in cigarettes  including a ban  if those restrictions would be appropriate for the public health 
the tpsac or the menthol report subcommittee held meetings on march   july   september   october   november   january   february   march   march  and july  to consider the issues surrounding the use of menthol in cigarettes 
at the march  meeting  tpsac presented its report and recommendations on menthol 
the report s findings included that menthol likely increases experimentation and regular smoking  menthol likely increases the likelihood and degree of addiction for youth smokers  non white menthol smokers particularly african americans are less likely to quit smoking and are less responsive to certain cessation medications  and that consumers continue to believe that smoking menthol cigarettes is less harmful than smoking nonmenthol cigarettes as a result of the cigarette industry s historical marketing 
tpsac s overall recommendation to the fda was that removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the united states 
at the july  meeting  tpsac considered revisions to its report  and the voting members unanimously approved the final report for submission to the fda with no change in its recommendation 
on june   the fda provided a progress report on its review of the science related to menthol cigarettes 
in the june update  the fda stated that experts within the fda center for tobacco products are conducting an independent review of the science related to the impact 
of menthol 
in cigarettes on public health the fda stated that it would submit its draft independent review of menthol science to an external peer review panel in july on january   the fda provided a second progress report on its review of the science related to menthol cigarettes 
in its january update  the fda stated that fda submitted its report to external scientists for peer review  and the agency is revising its report based on their feedback 
fda stated its intent to make the final report  along with the peer review scientists feedback and the agency s response to the feedback  available for public comment in the federal register 
the fda did not provide a date for releasing the final report 
the fda also indicated that it would consider any public comments to the final report  which may provide additional evidence or emerging data 
based on those comments  together with the agency s report  the tpsac report  the industry s perspective report and prior public comments  the fda stated that it will consider the collective evidence and possible actions related to the public health impact of menthol in cigarettes 
if the fda determines that regulation of menthol is warranted  the fda could promulgate regulations that  among other things  could result in a ban on or restrictions on the use of menthol in cigarettes 
since we are the leading manufacturer of mentholated cigarettes in the united states  we could face increased exposure to tobacco related litigation as a result of such allegations 
even if such claims are unsubstantiated  increased concerns about the health impact of mentholated cigarettes could materially adversely affect our sales  including sales of newport 
a ban or limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes by the fda would materially adversely affect our business 

table of contents the regulation of cigarettes by the food and drug administration may materially adversely affect our business 
in june  the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act was enacted granting the fda authority to regulate tobacco products 
as it relates to cigarettes  the legislation establishes a tobacco products scientific advisory committee to  among other things  evaluate the issues surrounding the use of menthol as a flavoring or ingredient in cigarettes and issue a nonbinding recommendation to the fda regarding menthol  grants the fda the regulatory authority to consider and impose broad additional restrictions through a rule making process  including a ban on the use of menthol in cigarettes  requires larger and more severe health warnings  including graphic images  on cigarette packs  cartons and advertising  bans the use of descriptors on cigarettes  such as low tar and light  requires the disclosure of cigarette ingredients and additives to consumers  requires pre market approval by the fda of all new cigarette products  including substantially equivalent products  requires pre market approval by the fda for claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products  allows the fda to require the reduction of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes  allows the fda to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in cigarettes  allows the fda to place more severe restrictions on the advertising  marketing and sales of cigarettes  and permits possible inconsistent state and local regulation of the advertising or promotion of cigarettes and eliminates the existing federal preemption of such regulation 
we believe that such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
for example  under the act  we must file a report with the fda substantiating that any cigarettes introduced or modified after february  are substantially equivalent to cigarettes on the market before that date to enable the agency to determine whether the new or modified products are substantially equivalent to specific predicate products already being sold 
for any products introduced or modified between february  and march   initial reports were required to be filed with the fda on or before march  the fda announced that a product introduced or modified before march  may remain on the market pending the fda s review  provided a substantially equivalent report was filed with the fda on or before march  we believe  based on the limited guidance issued by the fda to date  that we were required to file  and have filed  reports for all of our cigarettes on or before march  since modifications had been made to our products since while all of our cigarettes may remain on the market pending the fda s review  they are subject to removal should the fda determine any are not substantially equivalent 
in addition  products introduced on or after march  require pre market approval by the fda which may be subject to similar or more restrictive procedures 
one component of our strategic plan is the introduction of new cigarette products in adjacent market segments  in which we do not have a significant presence 
we have submitted a number of requests for approval of substantially equivalent new products with the fda 
although we believe that the statutory language of the fsptca suggests the pre market approval process should take days for substantially equivalent new products  the fda has not approved any substantially equivalent new product applications by us or anyone else in the industry as of february  we believe our ability to execute our strategic plan has been negatively impacted by the delay in the fda s new product approval process 

table of contents as of february   lorillard tobacco is a defendant in approximately  tobacco related lawsuits  including approximately cases in which lorillard  inc is a co defendant 
these cases  which are extremely costly to defend  could result in substantial judgments against lorillard tobacco and or lorillard  inc numerous legal actions  proceedings and claims arising out of the sale  distribution  manufacture  development  advertising  marketing and claimed health effects of cigarettes are pending against lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc  and it is likely that similar claims will continue to be filed for the foreseeable future 
in addition  several cases have been filed against lorillard tobacco and other tobacco companies challenging certain provisions of the msa among major tobacco manufacturers and states and various other governments and jurisdictions  and state statutes promulgated to carry out and enforce the msa 
punitive damages  often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars  are specifically pleaded in a number of cases in addition to compensatory and other damages 
it is possible that the outcome of these cases  individually or in the aggregate  could result in bankruptcy 
it is also possible that lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc may be unable to post a surety bond in an amount sufficient to stay execution of a judgment in jurisdictions that require such bond pending an appeal on the merits of the case 
even if lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc are successful in defending some or all of these actions  these types of cases are very expensive to defend 
a material increase in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense costs and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
further  adverse decisions in litigations against other tobacco companies could have an adverse impact on the industry  including us 
plaintiffs have been awarded damages  including punitive damages  from lorillard tobacco in a conventional product liability case

as of february   lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc are defendants in engle progeny cases that have been placed on courts trial calendars or in which specific trial dates have been set 
trial schedules are subject to change and it is not possible to predict how many of the engle progeny cases pending against lorillard tobacco or lorillard  inc will be tried in it also is not possible to predict whether some courts will implement procedures that consolidate multiple engle progeny cases for trial 
trials of some of the engle progeny cases have resulted in verdicts that have awarded damages from cigarette manufacturers  including us

as of february   the trial had not proceeded to a second phase to determine the amount of punitive damages  if any 
as of february   verdicts have been returned in engle progeny cases in which neither lorillard tobacco nor lorillard  inc were defendants since the florida supreme court issued its ruling 
juries awarded compensatory damages and punitive damages in of these trials 
the punitive damages awards have totaled approximately million and have ranged from  to million 
in of the trials  juries awarded only compensatory damages 
in the other trials  juries found in favor of the defendants 
in some of the trials decided in the defendants favor  plaintiffs have filed motions challenging the verdicts 
it is not possible to predict the final outcome of this litigation 
various intermediate state and federal florida appellate courts have issued rulings that address the scope of the preclusive effect of the findings from the first phase of the engle trial  including whether those findings relieve plaintiffs from the burden of proving certain legal elements of their claims 
in july  the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reversed the decision of the trial court in the bernice brown case  finding that it was premature to address the extent of any preclusive effect of the engle phase i findings until the scope of the factual issues decided in engle phase i was determined by the trial court 
in december  in the martin case  the florida first district court of appeal disagreed with the bernice brown ruling and found that the trial court correctly construed the florida supreme court s engle decision and that it properly instructed the jury on the preclusive effect of certain of the engle jury s findings 
in september  in the jimmie lee brown case  the florida fourth district court of appeal had a different interpretation of the effect of the engle decision on plaintiff s claims than both the bernice brown and martin courts 
in december  the us district court for the middle district of florida  in the waggoner case  found that the florida supreme court s engle decision to give the engle phase i findings preclusive effect  in conjunction with the martin and jimmie lee brown cases  was a constitutionally permissible application of florida law 
since the 
table of contents martin and jimmie lee brown decisions  other verdicts awarding damages to plaintiffs have been affirmed in intermediate state florida appellate courts 
the florida supreme court has granted review in one of those cases  the douglas case  to address the issue of whether a tobacco manufacturer s due process rights are violated by relying upon the engle phase i findings 
the florida supreme court heard argument in september the due process issue is also currently on appeal in the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit in the duke and walker cases 
the duke appeal has been stayed pending the florida supreme court s decision on douglas 
a joint motion to consolidate the duke and walker appeals and suspend any further activity on those appeals until after the florida supreme court s decision on douglas is also pending 
in connection with the engle progeny cases  lorillard and various other tobacco manufacturing defendants face various legal issues that could materially affect the outcome of the engle cases 
these legal issues include  but are not limited to  the application of the statute of limitations and statute of repose  the ability of an engle plaintiff to pursue a claim against defendants that did not manufacture or market the cigarettes plaintiff smoked  the constitutionality of a cap on the amount of a bond necessary to obtain an automatic stay of a post trial judgment  and whether a plaintiff s representative may continue an existing lawsuit or file a new lawsuit after that the original plaintiff has died 
various intermediate florida appellate courts and florida federal courts have issued rulings on these issues 
the judgment entered in the federal government s reimbursement case  while not final in all respects  could restrict or limit our defenses in other litigation 
in august  a final judgment and remedial order was entered in united states of america v 
philip morris usa  inc  et al 
us district court  district of columbia  filed september  
the court based its final judgment and remedial order on the government s only remaining claims  which were based on the defendants alleged violations of the racketeering influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
lorillard  inc is not a party to this matter  but lorillard tobacco is one of the defendants in the case 
although the verdict did not award monetary damages to the plaintiff  the final judgment and remedial order imposed a number of requirements on the defendants 
such requirements include  but are not limited to  the publishing of corrective statements by defendants related to the health effects of smoking 
in  a three judge panel of the court of appeals upheld substantially all of the district court s final judgment and remedial order 
in june  the us supreme court denied the parties petitions seeking review of the case 
the case has been returned to the us district court  district of columbia for implementation of the court of appeals directions in its ruling and for entry of an amended final judgment 
as of february   the trial court had not entered the amended final judgment 
the final judgment and remedial order made many adverse findings regarding the conduct of the defendants 
it is possible that the final opinion  final judgment and remedial order entered by the court could form the basis of allegations by the plaintiffs in other matters  or of additional judicial findings by other courts against cigarette manufacturers 
it is possible that other courts could apply the findings in the united states of america case to restrict or otherwise limit our defenses in other litigation 
a ruling by the united states supreme court could limit the ability of cigarette manufacturers to contend that certain claims asserted against them in product liability litigation are barred 
the supreme court s decision also could encourage litigation involving cigarettes labeled as lights or low tar 
in december  the united states supreme court issued a decision that neither the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act nor the federal trade commission s regulation of cigarettes tar and nicotine disclosures preempts or bars some of plaintiffs claims 
the decision also more broadly addresses the scope of preemption based on the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act  and could significantly limit cigarette manufacturers arguments that certain of plaintiffs other claims in smoking and health litigation  including claims based on the alleged concealment of information with respect to the hazards of smoking  are preempted 

table of contents in addition  the supreme court s ruling could encourage litigation against cigarette manufacturers  including us  regarding the sale of cigarettes labeled as lights or low tar  and it may limit cigarette manufacturers ability to defend such claims 
the supreme court issued this ruling in a purported lights class action  good v 
altria group  inc we were not a defendant in good 
the us surgeon general has issued reports regarding the risks of cigarette smoking to non smokers that could result in additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers  additional restrictions placed on the use of cigarettes  and additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes 
in a report entitled the health consequences of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke a report of the surgeon general   the us surgeon general summarized conclusions from previous surgeon general s reports concerning the health risks to non smokers from exposure to ets  also called second hand smoke 
according to this report  scientific evidence supported six major conclusions second hand smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults who do not smoke 
children exposed to second hand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome  acute respiratory infections and ear problems 
exposure of adults to second hand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes heart disease and lung cancer 
the scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk free level of exposure to second hand smoke 
many millions of americans  both children and adults  are exposed to second hand smoke in their homes and workplaces 
eliminating smoking in indoor spaces fully protects non smokers from exposure to second hand smoke 
separating smokers from non smokers  cleaning the air  and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures of non smokers to second hand smoke 
the surgeon general also addressed the health risks to non smokers from exposure to ets in the surgeon general report 
these reports could form the basis of additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers  including us 
the reports have been and in the future could be used to support litigation against us or other cigarette manufacturers 
it also is possible that the surgeon general s report could result in additional restrictions placed on cigarette smoking or in additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes 
it is possible that such additional restrictions or regulations could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the united states  including sales of our brands 
these developments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have substantial payment obligations under the state settlement agreements which will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and operating income in future periods 
in  lorillard tobacco  philip morris  rjr tobacco and brown williamson tobacco corporation now an affiliate of rjr tobacco the original participating manufacturers entered into the msa with states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims 
we and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota the initial state settlements and  together with the msa  are referred to as the state settlement agreements 
under the state settlement agreements  we paid billion in and estimate that we will pay between billion and billion in  primarily based on estimated industry volume 
annual payments under the state settlement agreements are required to be paid in perpetuity and are based  among other things  on our domestic market share and unit volume of domestic shipments  with respect to the msa  in the year preceding the year in which payment is due  and  with respect to the initial state settlements  in the year in which payment is due 

table of contents in the fourth quarter  rai  the parent of rjr tobacco  announced a change to a mark to market pension accounting method 
such method of accounting for pension and postretirement benefits results in the recognition of actuarial gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets or benefit obligations in the year it is incurred rather than amortized over the average future service period of the active employees in such plans 
amounts due under the state settlement agreements are impacted by a number of factors  including industry volume  market share and industry operating profits 
as a result of the change to mark to market pension accounting announced by rai  the industry operating profits as defined in the state settlement agreements may be impacted positively or negatively in any given year 
for example  in rai s mark to market pension adjustment resulted in a million reduction in our obligations under the state settlement agreements 
it is possible that our state settlement agreement obligations  results of operations  cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by rai s mark to market adjustments in the future 
we are unable to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of certain material pending litigation 
we record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
except for the impact of the state settlement agreements as described above  while it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred  i management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any material pending litigation against us  ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any material pending litigation due to the many variables  uncertainties and complexities surrounding pending litigation  and iii accordingly  management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for possible losses related to material pending litigation 
it is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period or its financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending or future litigation or an inability to secure bonds where required to stay the execution of judgments on appeal 
we may not be able to develop  produce or commercialize competitive new products and technologies required by regulatory changes or changes in consumer preferences 
consumer health concerns and changes in regulations are likely to require us to introduce new products or make substantial changes to existing products 
for example  all states and the district of columbia require cigarette manufacturers to reduce the ignition propensity of their products 
we believe that there may be increasing pressure from public health authorities to develop a conventional cigarette  an alternative cigarette or an alternative tobacco product that provides a demonstrable reduced risk of adverse health effects 
certain of the other major cigarette makers have already developed and marketed alternative cigarette products 
we may not be able to develop a reduced risk or reduced exposure product that the fda allows to be marketed or is acceptable to consumers 
in addition  the costs associated with developing any such new products and technologies could be substantial 
we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  brand recognition  brand loyalty  service  marketing  advertising and price 
we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions  erosion of consumer confidence  competitors introduction of low priced products or innovative products  increased competitive discounting and other promotional activity  higher excise taxes  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories  and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate cigarette products 
our principal competitors are the two other major us cigarette manufacturers  philip morris and rjr tobacco 
we also compete against numerous other smaller manufacturers or importers of cigarettes 
if our major 
table of contents competitors were to significantly increase the level of price discounts offered to consumers  we could respond by increasing price discounts  which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
the market for electronic cigarettes is evolving at a very fast pace and is very fragmented  and we compete with many smaller companies with similar product offerings 
the method of distribution for many competing companies is predominately over the internet  with only a small number of competitors currently having a significant presence at retail 
we are subject to important limitations on advertising and marketing cigarettes that could harm our competitive position 
television and radio advertisements of cigarettes have been prohibited since under the state settlement agreements  we generally cannot use billboard advertising  cartoon characters  sponsorship of concerts  non tobacco merchandise bearing lorillard s brand names and various other advertising and marketing techniques 
in addition  the msa prohibits the targeting of youth in advertising  promotion or marketing of cigarettes 
accordingly  we have determined not to advertise our cigarettes in magazines with large readership among people under the age of in june  the federal family smoking prevention and tobacco control act was enacted granting authority over the regulation of cigarettes to the fda 
pursuant to the fsptca  the fda reissued a set of marketing and sales restrictions originally promulgated in as part of an unsuccessful effort by the agency to assert jurisdiction over cigarettes 
the fsptca contains other restrictions on the advertising  marketing and sale of cigarette products more stringent than those found in the original fda rule 
in addition  many states  cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further restricting tobacco advertising  marketing and sales promotions  and others may do so in the future 
additional restrictions may be imposed or agreed to in the future 
these limitations may make it difficult to maintain the value of an existing brand if sales or market share decline for any reason 
moreover  these limitations significantly impair the ability of cigarette manufacturers  including us  to launch new premium brands 
the potential regulation of electronic cigarettes by the food and drug administration may materially adversely affect our electronic cigarette business 
during  the fda indicated that it intends to regulate electronic cigarettes under the fsptca through the issuance of deeming regulations that would include electronic cigarettes under the definition of a tobacco product under the fsptca subject to the fda s jurisdiction 
as of february   the fda had not taken such action 
the application of the fsptca to electronic cigarettes could impose  among other things  restrictions on the advertising  marketing and sale of electronic cigarettes  the use of certain flavorings and introducing new products 
see the regulation of cigarettes by the food and drug administration may materially adversely affect our business above for additional information on the fsptca restrictions applicable to cigarettes 
we cannot predict the scope of such regulations or the impact they may have on our electronic cigarette business  though if enacted  they could have a material adverse effect on our electronic cigarette business in the future 
changes in laws  regulations and other requirements could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition to the regulation of our business by the fda  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by new or future legal requirements imposed by legislative or regulatory initiatives  including but not limited to those relating to health care reform  climate change and environmental matters 
for example  the health care reform legislation  which was signed into law in march  resulted in the repeal of million of future tax deductions for medicare part d subsidies for our retiree drug benefits and could impact our accounting for retiree medical benefits  employer sponsored medical plans and related matters in future periods 
however  the extent of that impact  if any  cannot be determined until regulations are promulgated and additional interpretations of the health care law are available 
new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase 
table of contents the prices of goods and services because of increased costs or reduced availability 
we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory initiatives will result in significant changes to existing laws and regulations and or whether any changes in such laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
sales of cigarettes are subject to substantial federal  state and local excise taxes 
the federal excise tax on cigarettes was last increased on april  from per pack to per pack to finance health insurance for children 
for the twelve months ended december   combined state and local excise taxes ranged from to per pack of cigarettes 
various states and localities have raised the excise tax on cigarettes substantially in recent years 
during  state excise tax increases on cigarette sales were implemented in two states ranging from per pack to per pack 
it is our expectation that several states will propose further increases in and in subsequent years 
we believe that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes 
in addition  we believe that the increase in the federal excise tax  as well as possible future increases  the extent of which cannot be predicted  compounded by poor economic conditions  could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry  including us  and an increased sales shift toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than premium brands 
we are dependent on the domestic cigarette business  which we expect to continue to contract 
although we conduct business in puerto rico  guam and the us virgin islands  our cigarette business in the states of the united states the domestic cigarette market is currently our only significant business and has generally been contracting 
we do not have foreign cigarette sales that could offset these effects  as we sold the international rights to substantially all of our cigarette brands  including newport  in as a result of price increases  restrictions on advertising and promotions  increases in regulation and excise taxes  health concerns  a decline in the social acceptability of smoking  increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors  industry wide domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound annual rate of approximately during the period through industry wide domestic cigarette shipments decreased by an estimated for compared to  for compared to  for compared to and for compared to we expect the domestic cigarette market to continue to contract  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
we derive most of our revenue from one brand 
our largest selling brand  newport  accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales for our principal strategic plan revolves around the marketing and sales promotion in support of the newport brand 
we cannot ensure that we will continue to successfully implement our strategic plan with respect to newport or that implementation of our strategic plan will result in the maintenance  growth or profitability of the newport brand 
the use of significant amounts of promotion expenses and sales incentives in response to competitive actions and market price sensitivity may have a material adverse impact on our business 
since  the cigarette market has been increasingly price competitive due to the impact of  among other things  higher state and local excise taxes and the market share of deep discount brands 
in response to these and other competitor actions and pricing pressures  we have engaged in the significant use of promotional expenses and sales incentives 
the cost of these measures could have a material adverse impact on our business 
we regularly review the results of our promotional spending activities and adjust our promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain our competitive position 
accordingly  unit sales volume and sales promotion costs in any period are not necessarily indicative of sales and costs that may be realized in subsequent periods 
we rely on a limited number of key executives and may continue to experience difficulty in attracting and hiring qualified new personnel in some areas of our business 
the loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business 
as a tobacco company  we may experience difficulty in identifying and hiring qualified executives and other personnel in some areas of our business 
this difficulty is primarily attributable to the health and social issues associated with the tobacco 
table of contents industry 
the loss of services of any key personnel or our inability to attract and hire personnel with requisite skills could restrict our ability to develop new products  enhance existing products in a timely manner  sell products or manage our business effectively 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
increased restrictions on smoking in public places could adversely affect our sales volume  revenue and profitability 
in recent years  states and many local and municipal governments and agencies  as well as private businesses  have adopted legislation  regulations or policies which prohibit  restrict  or discourage smoking  smoking in public buildings and facilities  stores  restaurants and bars  and smoking on airline flights and in the workplace 
other similar laws and regulations are currently under consideration and may be enacted by state and local governments in the future 
although we have no empirical evidence of the effect of such restrictions  we believe that restrictions on smoking in public and other places may lead to a decrease in the number of people who smoke or a decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked by smokers 
increased restrictions on smoking in public and other places may have caused a decrease  and may continue to cause a decrease in the volume of cigarettes that would otherwise be sold by us absent such restrictions  which may have a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits 
we rely on a single manufacturing facility for the production of our cigarettes 
we produce all of our traditional cigarettes at our greensboro  north carolina manufacturing facility 
if our manufacturing plant is damaged  destroyed or incapacitated or we are otherwise unable to operate our manufacturing facility  we may be unable to produce cigarettes and may be unable to meet customer demand which could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits 
we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain of our leaf tobacco and reconstituted tobacco 
we purchased approximately  and of our leaf tobacco through one supplier in  and  alliance one international  inc alliance one 
if alliance one becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to us  we believe that leaf tobacco may not be available at prices comparable to those we pay to alliance one  which could have a material adverse effect on our future profits 
in addition  we purchase all of our reconstituted tobacco from one supplier  which is an affiliate of rai  one of our major competitors 
reconstituted tobacco is a form of tobacco material manufactured as a paper like sheet from small pieces of tobacco that are too small to incorporate into the cigarette directly and may include some tobacco stems  and which is used as a component of cigarette blends 
if rai becomes unwilling or unable to supply us and we are unable to find an alternative supplier on a timely basis  our operations could be disrupted resulting in lower production levels and reduced sales  which could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits in the future 
the availability of counterfeit cigarettes could adversely affect our sales volume  revenue and profitability 
sales of counterfeit cigarettes in the united states  including counterfeits of our newport brand  could adversely impact sales by the manufacturers of the brands that are counterfeited and potentially damage the value and reputation of those brands 
additionally  smokers who mistake counterfeit cigarettes for our cigarettes may attribute quality and taste deficiencies in the counterfeit product to our brands and discontinue purchasing our brands 
although we do not believe that sales of counterfeit newport cigarettes have had a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits to date  the availability of counterfeit newport cigarettes together with the potential regulation of cigarettes and their ingredients  substantial increases in excise taxes and other potential price increases could result in increased demand for counterfeit product that could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits in the future 

table of contents we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property  which could harm the value of our brands and have a material adverse effect on our business 
our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business 
our ability to maintain and further build brand recognition is dependent on the continued and exclusive use of our trademarks  service marks  trade dress  trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property  including our name and logo and the unique features of our tobacco products 
if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are ineffective  thereby permitting a third party to misappropriate or infringe on our intellectual property  the value of our brands may be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from growing or maintaining market share 
our business could be materially adversely affected by any failure  interruption or security lapse of our information technology systems 
our ability to effectively manage our business depends significantly on our information systems 
the failure of our current systems  or future upgrades  to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems  could result in transaction errors  processing inefficiencies  and the loss of sales and customers  disrupting our business 
in addition  cybersecurity threats are evolving and include  but are not limited to  malicious software  attempts to gain unauthorized access to data  denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems  unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data 
although we have in place various processes  procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats  there can be no assurance that these will be sufficient to prevent a material security threat 
if any of these events were to materialize  they could lead to disruption of our operations  loss of sensitive information or damage to our reputation  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  and of delaware law  may prevent or delay an acquisition of us  which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 
these provisions include a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms  elimination of the right of our shareholders to act by written consent  rules regarding how our shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings  the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval  and limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board with time to assess any acquisition proposal 
these provisions are not intended to prevent such takeovers 
however  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests and those of our shareholders 
the separation agreement between us and loews contains provisions that may prevent or discourage other companies from acquiring us 
the tax free nature of the separation may be affected by certain transactions undertaken by us 
in particular  under section e of the internal revenue code  the separation would become taxable to loews if it was 
table of contents determined that or more of the shares of our common stock were acquired  directly or indirectly  as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the separation 
if  as a result of acquisitions of our common stock subsequent to the separation  the separation becomes taxable pursuant to section e  loews would recognize a substantial gain for tax purposes as the separation would be treated as a sale of lorillard for federal income tax purposes 
the separation agreement requires us and any successor entity to indemnify loews for any losses resulting from the failure of the separation to qualify as a tax free transaction except if the failure to qualify is solely due to loews s fault 
this indemnification obligation applies regardless of whether the action is restricted as described above  or whether we or a potential acquirer obtains a supplemental ruling or an opinion of counsel 
these restrictions and potential indemnification obligations may prevent or discourage other companies from acquiring us 
we are required to indemnify loews against losses and other expenses incurred at any time including with respect to smoking and health claims and litigation with respect to our assets  properties and businesses 
in the separation agreement  we have agreed to indemnify loews and its officers  directors  employees and agents against costs and expenses including  but not limited to  litigation matters and other claims based on  arising out of or resulting from  among other things  the ownership or the operation of us and our assets and properties  and the operation or conduct of us and our businesses at any time prior to or following the separation including with respect to smoking and health claims and litigation 
if loews incurs legal or other fees or costs and expenses resulting from the operation of our businesses or otherwise with respect to us  we are required to reimburse loews for such losses and any legal or other fees related thereto  which could be substantial 
these indemnification obligations may discourage third parties from trying to acquire us because our indemnification obligations are binding on our successors and we are prohibited by the separation agreement from merging  consolidating or transferring all or a significant portion of our properties or assets unless the resulting entity  transferee or successor agrees to be bound by these indemnification obligations 
in addition  we could face substantial charges for indemnification payments to loews  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not believe the separation has altered or will alter our legal exposure with respect to tobacco related claims

actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in the forward looking statements  item a 
risk factors  business environment and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
overview we conduct our business through two operating segments the cigarettes segment and the electronic cigarettes segment 
the cigarettes segment consists principally of the operations of lorillard  inc  lorillard tobacco and related entities 
lorillard tobacco is the third largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the united states 
founded in  lorillard tobacco is the oldest continuously operating tobacco company in the united states 
newport  lorillard s flagship premium cigarette brand  is the top selling menthol and second largest selling cigarette overall in the united states based on gross units sold during the years ended december  and in addition to the newport brand  the lorillard product line has four additional brand families marketed under the kent  true  maverick and old gold brand names 
these five cigarette brands include different product offerings which vary in price  taste  flavor  length and packaging 
the electronic cigarettes segment consists prinicipally of the operations of loec  inc and related entities 
loec  inc 
is a leading electronic cigarette company in the united states  marketed under the blu ecigs brand 
lorillard acquired the blu ecigs brand and other assets used in the manufacture  distribution  development  research  marketing  advertising and sale of electronic cigarettes on april  certain selling  general and administrative expenses of the cigarettes segment have been allocated to the electronic cigarettes segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the financial statements include our subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions 
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap  applied on a consistent basis 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements and related notes include accruals for tobacco settlement costs  legal expenses and litigation costs  sales incentive programs  income taxes and share based compensation  the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit expenses  the valuation of pension assets and the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  evaluation of current trends  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances at the time 
we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved with this type of judgment  actual results could differ significantly from estimates and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and equity 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets the acquisition of blu ecigs in april of has resulted in the recording of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets 
upon acquisition  the purchase price was first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities  including trademarks and other intangible assets  and the remainder of the purchase price was recorded as goodwill 
our trademarks and goodwill are considered indefinite lived intangible assets and as such are not amortized 
all of our trademarks and recognized intangible assets have been recorded as a part of our electronic cigarettes reporting segment 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of november of each year and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
goodwill valuations goodwill is evaluated using a two step impairment test at the reporting unit level 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the book value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  with its fair value 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we perform the second step of the impairment test 
in the second step  we estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill 
the difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
in arriving at the fair value of a reporting unit  we utilize a combination of the income and market approaches 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that is determined based on current market conditions 
the projection uses management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales  costs and number of units  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics 
finally  we consider the implied control premium and conclude whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on other recent market transactions 
we believe we have based our goodwill impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  and as a result of our annual testing of goodwill performed as of november   the estimated fair value of the electronic cigarettes reporting unit was substantially in excess of its reported carrying value 
intangible asset valuations the fair value of our acquired trademarks and trade names are estimated utilizing the relief from royalty method  and compared to the carrying value 
the main assumptions utilized in the relief from royalty method are projected revenues from our long range plan  assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
based on our impairment testing performed as of november   the estimated fair value of the blu ecigs trademark and trade name was substantially in excess of its carrying value  and  therefore  no impairment was determined to exist 
for additional information about goodwill and intangible asset valuations  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page revenue recognition revenue from product sales  net of sales incentives  is recognized at the time ownership of the goods transfers to customers and collectability is reasonably assured 
federal excise taxes are recognized on a gross 
table of contents basis and are included in both sales and cost of sales 
sales incentives include retail price discounts  coupons and retail display allowances and are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on amounts estimated as due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based primarily on use and redemption rates 
tobacco settlement costs in  lorillard tobacco  philip morris  rjr tobacco and brown williamson tobacco corporation now an affiliate of rjr tobacco the original participating manufacturers entered into the msa with states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims 
we and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota which are referred to as the initial state settlements  and together with the msa  are referred to as the state settlement agreements 
our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments and legal fees is based on our relative share of the settling manufacturers domestic cigarette shipments  with respect to the msa  in the year preceding that in which the payment is due  and  with respect to the initial state settlements  in the year in which payment is due 
we record our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments as part of cost of sales as product is shipped 
please read state settlement agreements beginning on page for additional information 
tobacco and other litigation we and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation 
plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and punitive damages  although some seek damages ranging into the billions of dollars 
plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages  statutory damages  return of profits  equitable and injunctive relief  and medical monitoring  among other damages 
we believe that we have valid defenses to the cases pending against us 
we also believe we have valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against us 
while we intend to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation  it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably 
we may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if we believe it is appropriate to do so 
we establish accruals in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  contingencies asc  when a material litigation liability is both probable and can be reasonably estimated 
there are a number of factors impacting our ability to estimate the possible loss or a range of loss  including the specific facts of each matter  the legal theories proffered by plaintiffs and legal defenses available to us  the wide ranging outcomes reached in similar cases  differing procedural and substantive laws in the various jurisdictions in which lawsuits have been filed  including whether punitive damages may be pursued or are permissible  the degree of specificity in a plaintiff s complaint  the history of the case and whether discovery has been completed  plaintiffs history of use of our cigarettes relative to those of the other defendants  the attribution of damages  if any  among multiple defendants  the application of contributory and or comparative negligence to the allocation of damage awards among plaintiffs and defendants  the likelihood of settlements for de minimus amounts prior to trial  the likelihood of success at trial  the likelihood of success on appeal  and the impact of current and pending state and federal appellate decisions 
it has been our experience and is our continued expectation that the above complexities and uncertainties will not be clarified until the late stages of litigation 
for those reasonably possible loss contingencies for which an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made  we disclose the nature of the litigation and any developments as appropriate 
we monitor the status of all outstanding litigation on an ongoing basis in order to determine the probability of loss and assess whether an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss can be determined 
in evaluating litigation  we consider  among other things  the nature of the claims  the jurisdiction in which the claims have been filed and the law and case law developed in that jurisdiction  the experience of plaintiffs counsel in this type of litigation  the parties respective litigation strategies  the stage of the proceedings  the outcome of the 
table of contents matters at trial or on appeal  the type and amount of damages claimed by plaintiffs  the outcomes and damage awards  if any  for similar matters brought against us and or the tobacco industry  and the possibility and likelihood of success on appeal 
our assessment of a possible loss or range of loss is based on our assessment of the final outcome of the litigation upon the conclusion of all appeals 
we record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
except for the impact of the state settlement agreements as described above  while it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred  i we have concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any material pending litigation against us  ii we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any material pending litigation due to the many variables  uncertainties and complexities described above  and iii accordingly  we have not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for possible losses related to material pending litigation 
it is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period or our financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending or future litigation or an inability to secure bonds where required to stay the execution of judgments on appeal 
defense costs associated with product liability claims are a significant component of our selling  general and administrative expenses and are accrued as incurred 
defense costs may increase in future periods  in part  as a result of the engle progeny cases as described in note  legal proceedings  to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page numerous factors affect product liability defense costs in any given period 
the principal factors are as follows the number and types of cases filed  the number of cases tried and appealed  the development of the law  the application of new or different theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel  and litigation strategy and tactics 
please read note legal proceedings  to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation affecting us 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations we are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans 
the assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets and the expected rate of compensation increases 
these assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors such as inflation  interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 
in determining the discount rate assumption  we utilized current market information and liability information  including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations 
in particular  the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities 
the discount rate was determined by projecting the plan s expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation  discounting those expected payments using a theoretical zero coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high quality bonds as of the measurement date  and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that resulted in the same projected benefit obligation 

table of contents the salary growth assumption reflects our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  asset allocations and management s expectation of the future economic environment 
our major assumptions are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page for  hypothetical changes in the assumptions we used for the pension plans would have had the following impact on our pension expense a decrease of basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased our pension expense by approximately million  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have increased our pension expense by approximately million  and an increase of basis points in the future salary growth rate would have increased our net pension expense by approximately million 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standard codification topic income taxes asc 
under asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
the uncertain tax provisions of asc prescribe a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
additionally  asc provides guidance on the measurement  derecognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions  along with accounting for the related interest and penalties 
inventories cigarette inventories including leaf tobacco  manufactured stock and materials and supplies are valued at the lower of cost  determined on a last in  first out lifo basis  or market 
the inventory of leaf tobacco is classified as a current asset in accordance with generally recognized trade practice although  due to the duration of the aging processes  a significant portion of the tobacco on hand will not be sold or used within one year 
electronic cigarette inventories are valued at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out fifo basis  or market and are included in manufactured stock 
recent accounting pronouncements please read recently adopted accounting pronouncements in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page business environment participants in the us tobacco industry  including us  face a number of issues that have adversely affected their results of operations and financial condition in the past and will continue to do so  including a substantial volume of litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages ranging into the billions of dollars  as well as equitable and injunctive relief  arising out of allegations of cancer and other health effects resulting from the use of cigarettes  addiction to smoking or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke  including claims for economic damages relating to alleged misrepresentation concerning the use of descriptors such as lights  as well as other alleged damages 

table of contents substantial annual payments continuing in perpetuity  and significant restrictions on marketing and advertising have been agreed to and are required under the terms of certain settlement agreements  including the master settlement agreement among major tobacco manufacturers and states and various other governments and jurisdictions the msa that we entered into in along with philip morris  rjr tobacco and brown williamson tobacco corporation now an affiliate of rjr tobacco the other original participating manufacturers to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims 
we and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota the initial state settlements  and together with the msa  the state settlement agreements 
the state settlement agreements impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and on the other major us cigarette manufacturers as product is sold and place significant restrictions on our and their ability to market and sell cigarettes 
the domestic cigarette market  in which we conduct our only significant business  continues to contract 
as a result of price increases  restrictions on advertising  promotions and smoking in public and private facilities  increases in regulation and excise taxes  health concerns  a decline in the social acceptability of smoking  increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors  domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound rate of approximately from through increases in cigarette prices since have led to an increase in the volume of discount and  specifically  deep discount cigarettes 
cigarette price increases have been driven by increases in federal  state and local excise taxes and by manufacturer price increases 
price increases have led  and continue to lead  to high levels of discounting and other promotional activities for premium brands 
deep discount brands have grown from an estimated domestic shipment share in of less than to an estimated share of for the twelve months ended december   and continue to be a significant competitive factor in the domestic cigarette market 
we do not have sufficient empirical data to determine whether the increased price of cigarettes has deterred consumers from starting to smoke or encouraged them to quit smoking  but it is likely that increased prices may have had an adverse effect on consumption and may continue to do so 
the tobacco industry is subject to substantial and increasing regulation 
in june  the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act the fsptca was enacted granting the fda authority to regulate tobacco products 
pursuant to the terms of the fsptca  the fda established the tobacco products scientific advisory committee the tpsac to evaluate  among other things  the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health 
in march  the tpsac issued its report to the fda stating that removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health 
on july   tpsac considered revisions to its report  and the voting members unanimously approved the final report for submission to the fda with no change in its recommendation 
the fda could promulgate regulations that  among other things  could result in a ban on or restrict the use of menthol in cigarettes 
the law imposes and will impose new restrictions on the manner in which cigarettes can be advertised and marketed  requires larger and more severe health warnings on cigarette packaging  permits restriction of the level of tar and nicotine contained in or yielded by cigarettes and may alter the way cigarette products are developed and manufactured 
on june   the fda provided a progress report on its review of the science related to menthol cigarettes 
in its menthol update  the fda stated that experts within the fda center for tobacco products are conducting an independent review of the science related to the impact 
of menthol 
in cigarettes on public health the fda also stated that it will submit its draft independent review of menthol science to an external peer review panel in july  and that following the peer review period originally announced as three and one half months  the fda will make available the results of the peer review and its preliminary scientific assessment for public comment 
on january   the fda stated that its report had been submitted to the peer review panel and comments had been received from the panel on the report 
the fda also indicated that its final report  including the peer review comments  will be released for public comment at a future date 

table of contents in august  we  along with rjr tobacco  other tobacco manufacturers and a tobacco retailer  filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the western district of kentucky against the fda challenging the constitutionality of certain restrictions on speech included in the fsptca 
these restrictions on speech include  among others  bans on the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising  limits on the right to make truthful statements regarding modified risk tobacco products  a prohibition on making certain statements about the fda s regulation of tobacco products  restrictions on the placement of outdoor advertising  a ban on certain promotions offering gifts in consideration for the purchase of tobacco products  a ban on brand name sponsorship of events and the sale of brand name merchandise  and a ban on the distribution of product samples 
the suit also challenges the law s requirement for extensive graphic warning labels on all packaging and advertising 
the complaint seeks a judgment i declaring that such provisions of the law violate the first and or fifth amendments of the us constitution and ii enjoining the fda from enforcing the unconstitutional provisions of the law 
on january   the district court issued an order a striking down the provisions of the law that banned the use of color and graphics in certain tobacco product advertising and prohibited tobacco manufacturers from making certain statements about the fda s regulation of tobacco products and b upholding the remaining challenged advertising provisions 
both sides appealed the district court ruling to the sixth circuit court of appeals  and on march  the sixth circuit issued an opinion i affirming the district court s decision upholding the fsptca s restrictions on marketing modified risk tobacco products  bans on event sponsorship  branding nontobacco merchandise  and free sampling  ii affirming the district court s decision upholding the fsptca s requirement that tobacco manufacturers reserve significant packaging space for graphic health warnings  iii affirming the district court s decision striking down the fsptca s restriction of tobacco advertising  in most instances  to black and white text  iv reversing the district court s decision upholding the fsptca s restriction on statements regarding the relative safety of tobacco products based on fda regulation and its decision upholding the fsptca s ban on tobacco continuity programs in most instances 
plaintiffs motion for rehearing en banc was denied  and plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari with the us supreme court on october  the government s response to the petition for certiorari is due on march  the government did not appeal the part of the court of appeal s ruling striking the fsptca s restriction of tobacco advertising to black and white text 
while we believe there is established legal precedent supporting our petition for certiorari and our claims we cannot predict the outcome of that petition or any further appeal 
nor can we make any assurances that our petition or any such appeal will be successful 
in february  we  along with rjr tobacco  filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of columbia against the fda challenging the composition of the tpsac because of the fda s appointment of certain voting members with significant financial conflicts of interest 
we believe these members are financially biased because they regularly testify as expert witnesses against tobacco product manufacturers  and because they are paid consultants for pharmaceutical companies that develop and market smoking cessation products 
the suit similarly challenges the presence of certain conflicted individuals on the constituents subcommittee of the tpsac 
the complaint seeks a judgment i declaring that  among other things  the appointment of the conflicted individuals to the tpsac and its constituents subcommittee was arbitrary  capricious  an abuse of discretion  and otherwise not in compliance with the law because it prevented the tpsac from preparing a report that was unbiased and untainted by conflicts of interest  and ii enjoining the fda from  among other things  relying on the tpsac s report 
the fda filed a motion to dismiss this action and the parties briefed the issue with a hearing held on february  on august   the court denied the fda s motion to dismiss 
on october   the fda filed its answer to the amended complaint and the case will proceed before the us district court for the district of columbia 
in august  we  along with rjr tobacco and several other tobacco manufacturers  filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of columbia against the fda challenging the constitutionality of certain regulations requiring specific graphic warning labels on all packaging and advertising 
the complaint seeks a judgment i declaring that the regulations violate the first 
table of contents amendment  ii declaring that the regulations violate various provisions of the administrative procedure act  iii declaring that the textual and graphic warnings required under the fsptca shall become effective months after the fda issues regulations that are permissible under the us constitution and federal law  and iv preliminarily and permanently enjoining enforcement of the regulations 
plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction  and after full briefing and oral argument  the district court granted plaintiffs motion 
plaintiffs also moved in the district court for summary judgment in their favor and after full briefing and oral argument  the district court granted that motion too 
the fda appealed both decisions to the dc circuit court of appeals  which consolidated the appeals and heard oral argument on april  on august   the dc circuit court of appeals affirmed the lower court s judgment that the graphic warnings were unconstitutional  vacated the regulations and remanded them to the fda 
on october   the fda filed a motion with the court of appeals for rehearing or rehearing en banc 
that motion was denied on december  the fda s deadline for filing a petition for certiorari with the us supreme court is march  electronic cigarettes are generally less regulated than cigarettes 
however  during  the fda indicated that it intends to regulate electronic cigarettes under the fsptca through the issuance of deeming regulations that would include electronic cigarettes under the definition of a tobacco product under the fsptca subject to the fda s jurisdiction 
as of february   the fda had not taken such action 
we cannot predict the scope of such regulations or the impact they may have on our electronic cigarette business  though if enacted  they could have a material adverse effect on our electronic cigarette business in the future 
the federal government and many state and local governments and agencies  as well as private businesses  have adopted legislation  regulations or policies which prohibit  restrict or discourage smoking  including legislation  regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in public buildings and facilities  stores  restaurants and bars  on airline flights and in the workplace 
other similar laws and regulations are under consideration and may be enacted by federal  state and local governments in the future 
substantial federal  state and local excise taxes are reflected in the retail price of cigarettes 
for the twelve months ended december   the federal excise tax was per pack and combined state and local excise taxes ranged from to per pack 
for the twelve months ended december   excise tax increases ranging from to per pack were implemented in two states 
on june   new york state legislature approved a per pack state excise tax increase that was implemented on july  the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased by per pack from per pack of cigarettes to per pack  effective april   to finance health insurance for children 
it is likely that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and that the most recent increase and future increases  the extent of which cannot be predicted  could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry  including us  and an increased sales shift toward deep discount cigarettes rather than premium brands 
in addition  we and other cigarette manufacturers and importers are required to pay an assessment under a federal law designed to fund payments to tobacco quota holders and growers and are required to pay an annual user fee to the fda 
the domestic market for cigarettes is highly competitive 
competition is primarily based on a brand s taste  quality  price  including the level of discounting and other promotional activities  positioning  consumer loyalty  and retail display 
our principal competitors are the two other major us cigarette manufacturers  philip morris usa and rjr tobacco 
we also compete with numerous other smaller manufacturers and importers of cigarettes  including deep discount cigarette manufacturers 
we believe our ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained in some marketing areas as a result of retail merchandising contracts offered by philip morris usa and rjr tobacco which limit the retail shelf space available to our brands 
as a result  in some retail locations we are limited in competitively supporting our promotional programs  which may constrain sales

proceeds from the revolver may be used for general corporate and working capital purposes 
the interest rates on borrowings under the revolver are based on prevailing interest rates and  in part  upon the credit rating applicable to our senior unsecured long term debt

there were no borrowings under the revolver during  or state settlement agreements the state settlement agreements require us and the other original participating manufacturers philip morris  rjr tobacco and brown williamson tobacco corporation now an affiliate of rjr tobacco to make aggregate annual payments of billion in perpetuity  subject to adjustment for several factors described below 
in addition  the original participating manufacturers are required to pay plaintiffs attorneys fees  subject to an aggregate annual cap of million 
these payment obligations are several and not joint obligations of each of the original participating manufacturers 
our obligations under the state settlement agreements will materially adversely affect our cash flows and operating income in future years 
both the aggregate payment obligations of the original participating manufacturers  and our payment obligations  individually  under the state settlement agreements are subject to adjustment for several factors which include inflation  aggregate volume of original participating manufacturers cigarette shipments  other original participating manufacturers and our market share  and aggregate original participating manufacturers operating income  allocated to such manufacturers that have operating income increases 
the inflation adjustment increases payments on a compounded annual basis by the greater of or the actual total percentage change in the consumer price index for the preceding year 
the inflation adjustment is measured starting with inflation for the volume adjustment increases or decreases payments based on the increase or decrease in the total number of cigarettes shipped in or to the us states  the district of columbia and puerto rico by the original participating manufacturers during the preceding year compared to the base year shipments 
if volume has increased  the volume adjustment would increase the annual payment by the same percentage as the number of cigarettes shipped exceeds the base number 
if volume has decreased  the 
table of contents volume adjustment would decrease the annual payment by of the percentage reduction in volume 
in addition  downward adjustments to the annual payments for changes in volume may  subject to specified conditions and exceptions  be reduced in the event of an increase in the original participating manufacturers aggregate operating income from domestic sales of cigarettes over base year levels established in the state settlement agreements  adjusted for inflation 
any adjustments resulting from increases in operating income would be allocated among those original participating manufacturers who have had increases 
during  we paid billion under the state settlement agreements  primarily based on volume 
included in the above number was million we deposited in an interest bearing escrow account in accordance with procedures established in the msa pending resolution of a claim by us and the other original participating manufacturers that they are entitled to reduce their msa payments based on a loss of market share to non participating manufacturers 
most of the states that are parties to the msa are disputing the availability of the reduction and we believe that this dispute will ultimately be resolved by judicial and arbitration proceedings 
our million reduction is based upon the original participating manufacturers collective loss of market share in that resulted in a reduction of million  partially offset by unfavorable adjustments for years and of million and million  respectively 
in april of     and  we had previously deposited million  million  million  million  million and million  respectively  in the same escrow account discussed above  which was based on a loss of market share in     and to non participating manufacturers 
in february  we directed the transfer of million from this account to the non disputed account  related to the loss of market share in  pursuant to an agreement concerning arbitration that we and other participating manufacturers entered into with certain msa states 
this amount was then paid to the msa states 
we and other original participating manufacturers have the right to claim additional reductions of msa payments in subsequent years under provisions of the msa 
on december   lorillard tobacco  along with other participating manufacturers  agreed to a term sheet with states and the district of columbia and puerto rico that resolves disputes under the master settlement agreement msa involving payment adjustments relating to nonparticipating manufacturers 
the settlement would resolve the claims for the years through and would put in place a new method for calculating this adjustment beginning in under the terms of the agreement  lorillard tobacco and other manufacturers will receive credits against their future msa payments over the next five years  and the signatory states will be entitled to receive their allocable share of the amounts currently being held in escrow resulting from these disputes 
the term sheet is subject to approval by the arbitration panel presiding over the arbitration of the dispute for if the settlement proceeds and is approved  lorillard tobacco expects to receive credits over the next five years totaling at least million on its outstanding claims  with the majority of the credits occurring in april and the remainder over the following four years 
as of february   the arbitration panel has not made its ruling with regard to the settlement 
no amounts have been included in results related to the settlement 
certain non settling states have objected to the request for approval 
no assurance can be given that the arbitration panel will issue the order necessary for the agreement to proceed or that the objections or any other such actions by nonsignatory states will be resolved in a manner favorable to lorillard 
contractual cash payment obligations the following table presents the contractual cash payment obligations of lorillard as of december  total less than year years years more than years in millions senior notes interest payments related to notes contractual purchase obligations operating lease obligations total 
table of contents as of december   we do not believe that we will make any payments in the next twelve months related to gross unrecognized tax benefits 
we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that may result in cash settlements for periods beyond twelve months 
as previously discussed  we have entered into the state settlement agreements which impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major us cigarette manufacturers 
our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments  including fees to settling plaintiffs attorneys  are based on a number of factors which are described above 
our cash payment under the state settlement agreements in amounted to billion and we estimate our cash payments in under the state settlement agreements will be between billion and billion  primarily based on estimated industry volume 
payment obligations are not incurred until the related sales occur and therefore are not reflected in the above table

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in financial instruments that involve market risk 
our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented below for each class of financial instrument we held at december   assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
we believe that the rate of adverse market movement represents a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
the market risk exposure represents the potential loss in carrying value and pretax impact to future earnings caused by the hypothetical change in price 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management 
senior management approves our overall investment strategy and has the responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk 
interest rate risk 
our investments  which are included in cash and cash equivalents  consist of money market funds with financial institutions 
those investments are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
a sensitivity analysis  based on a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates on our average investments  would cause an increase or decrease in pre tax income of approximately million 
our debt is denominated in us dollars and has been issued at a fixed rate 
in september  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of million to hedge changes in fair value of the notes due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate 
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in earnings along with offsetting adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged debt 
a sensitivity analysis  based on a hypothetical change in libor  would cause an increase or decrease in pretax income of approximately million for liquidity risk 
we may be forced to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expiration date if our debt rating is downgraded below ba by moody s or bb by s p 
this could have a negative impact on our cash position 
early cash settlement would result in the timing of our hedge settlement not being matched to the cash settlement of the debt 
as of december  our moody s debt rating was baa  and our s p debt rating was bbb  both of which are above the ratings at which settlement of our derivative contracts would be required
