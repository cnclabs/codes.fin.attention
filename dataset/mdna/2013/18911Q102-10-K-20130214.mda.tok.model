item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
cloud peak energy resources llc cpe resources is the sole direct subsidiary of cloud peak energy inc cpe inc  providing of cpe inc total consolidated revenue for the year ended december  and constituting nearly of cpe inc total consolidated assets as of ended december  unless the context indicates otherwise  the terms cloud peak energy  the company  we  us  and our refer to both cpe inc and cpe resources and their subsidiaries 
discussions or areas of this report that either apply only to cpe inc or cpe resources are clearly noted in such sections 
this item may contain forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
when considering these forward looking statements you should keep in mind the cautionary statements in this report and our other securities and exchange commission sec filings 
please see the sections entitled cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements and item a risk factors elsewhere in this document 
this item is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in item overview cpe inc is one of the largest producers of coal in the us and the prb  based on our coal sales 
we operate some of the safest mines in the coal industry 
according to msha data  in  we had one of the lowest employee all injury incident rates among the largest us coal producing companies 
we currently operate solely in the prb  the lowest cost region of the major coal producing regions in the u 
s  where we operate three wholly owned surface coal mines  the antelope mine  the cordero rojo mine and the spring creek mine  and own a non operating interest in a fourth surface mine  the decker mine 
we also have two major development projects  the youngs creek project and the potential crow project 
we continue to seek ways to increase our future export capacity through existing and proposed new pacific northwest export terminals  including our option agreement with ssa marine and potential option at the millennium terminal that would be granted upon closing our decker transaction with ambre energy 
our antelope and cordero rojo mines are located in wyoming and are two of the four largest coal mines in the us our spring creek mine is located in montana  and is the largest us exporter of thermal coal into south korea 
our mines produce subbituminous thermal coal with low sulfur content  and we sell our coal primarily to domestic and foreign electric utilities 
we do not produce any metallurgical coal 
thermal coal is primarily consumed by electric utilities and industrial consumers as fuel for electricity generation and steam output 
in  the coal we produced generated approximately of the electricity produced in the us as of december   we controlled approximately billion tons of proven and probable reserves 
for information regarding our revenue and long lived assets by geographic area  as well as revenue from external customers  adjusted ebitda and total assets by segment  please see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item during  we acquired rights to substantial undeveloped coal and complementary surface assets in the northern prb youngs creek project 
in january  we executed an option to lease agreement option agreement and a corresponding exploration agreement exploration agreement with the crow tribe of indians  which are subject to approval by the department of the interior 
this potential coal project the crow project is located on the crow indian reservation in southeast montana  near our spring creek mine and youngs creek project 
we are in the process of 
table of contents evaluating the development options for the youngs creek project and the potential crow project  but believe that their proximity to the spring creek mine represents an opportunity to optimize our mine developments in the northern prb 
on december   we and the other owner in the decker mine  ambre energy  announced that we entered into agreements for ambre energy to purchase our interest in the decker mine and assume all reclamation liabilities 
the agreements will also provide for the joint resolution and dismissal of the pending decker litigation 
see item legal proceedings decker litigation 
the transaction is expected to close in the first half of and is subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions 
in february  we announced a throughput option agreement with ssa marine that provides us with an option for up to million tonnes of capacity per year through the planned dry bulk cargo gateway pacific terminal at cherry point in the state of washington 
our potential share of capacity will depend upon the ultimate capacity of the terminal 
the terminal would accommodate cape size vessels 
our option is exercisable following future permit completion for the terminal 
for purposes of this report  the term northern prb refers to the area within the prb that lies within montana and the northern part of sheridan county  wyoming 
our spring creek mine  the decker mine  the youngs creek project and the potential crow project are located in the northern prb 
segment information historically  we have reported one segment the production of low sulfur  thermal coal from surface mines located in the western region of the us within the prb  which is sold to electric utilities and industrial customers 
based upon current year results  we have presented our reportable segments for all periods as owned and operated mines  logistics and related activities  and corporate and other 
our owned and operated mines segment is characterized by the predominant focus on thermal coal production where the sale occurs at the mine site and where title and risk of loss pass to the customer at that point 
this segment includes our antelope  cordero rojo  and spring creek mines 
sales in this segment are primarily to domestic electric utilities  although a portion is made to our logistics and related activities segment 
our mines utilize surface mining extraction processes and are all located in the prb 
our logistics and related activities segment is characterized by the services we provide to our international and domestic customers where we deliver coal to them 
services provided typically include delivered sales contract negotiations  purchase of coal from third parties or from our owned and operated mines  coordination of the transportation and delivery of purchased coal  and sales contract administration activities 
title and risk of loss are retained by the logistics and related activities segment through the transportation and delivery process 
title and risk of loss pass to the customer in accordance with the contract and typically occur at either a vessel loading terminal  a vessel unloading terminal or an end use facility 
risk associated with rail and terminal take or pay agreements is also borne by the logistics and related activities segment 
forward market pricing risk is managed through international coal forward contracts 
the gains and losses resulting from our international coal forward derivative financial instruments are reported within this segment 
our corporate and other segment includes results relating to broker activity  our share of the decker mine operations  and unallocated corporate costs and assets 
eliminations represent the purchase and sale of coal between reportable segments and the associated elimination of intercompany profit or loss in inventory 

table of contents history cpe inc acquired approximately and the managing member interest in cpe resources in exchange for a promissory note which was repaid with proceeds from its initial public offering of its common stock ipo on november  rio tinto retained ownership of the remaining until december   when cpe inc priced a secondary offering of its common stock on behalf of rio tinto 
in connection with the secondary offering  cpe inc exchanged shares of common stock for the common membership units of cpe resources held by rio tinto and completed the secondary offering on behalf of rio tinto the secondary offering  resulting in our acquisition of of rio tinto holdings in cpe resources 
as a result of this transaction  cpe resources became a wholly owned subsidiary of cpe inc  and rio tinto no longer holds an interest in cpe resources 
core business operations our key business drivers include the following the volume of coal sold from our owned and operated mines  the price for which we sell our coal  the costs of mining  including labor  repairs and maintenance  fuel  explosives  depreciation of capital equipment  and depletion of coal leases  capital expenditures to acquire property  plant and equipment  the volume of deliveries coordinated by our logistics and related activities segment to customer contracted destinations  the costs for logistics services  rail  and port charges for coal sales made on a delivered basis  and the results of our coal forward contracts 
the volume of coal that we sell in any given year is driven by global and domestic demand for coal generated electric power 
demand for coal generated electric power may be affected by many factors including weather patterns  natural gas prices  coal fired generating capacity and utilization  environmental and legal challenges  political and regulatory factors  energy policies  international and domestic economic conditions  and other factors discussed in this item and in item a risk factors 
the price at which we sell our coal is a function of the demand relative to the supply for coal 
we typically enter into multi year contracts with our customers which helps mitigate the risks associated with any short term imbalance in supply and demand 
we seek to enter each year with expected production effectively fully sold 
this strategy helps us run our mines at predictable production rates  which helps us control operating costs 
as is common in the prb  coal seams at our existing mines naturally deepen  resulting in additional overburden to be removed at additional cost 
in line with the worldwide mining industry  we have experienced increased operating costs for mining equipment  diesel fuel and supplies  and employee wages and salaries 
during the second quarter of  we commenced the use of costless collars to help manage certain exposures to diesel fuel prices 
we incur significant capital expenditures to maintain  update and expand our mining equipment  surface land holdings and coal reserves 
in line with the worldwide mining industry trends  the cost of capital equipment is generally increasing 
in addition  as the costs of acquiring federal coal leases and associated surface rights increase  our depletion costs also increase 
as of december   we controlled approximately billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
during the second 
table of contents quarter of  we completed our acquisition of the youngs creek project for million of available cash on hand 
we believe the location of the coal and surface lands  as well as the quality of the acquired coal  position us well for continued supply in the domestic coal market and for future growth in our asian exports as additional terminal capacity becomes available 
as the youngs creek project is an undeveloped greenfield surface mine project  we are not yet able to classify these mineral rights as proven and probable reserves 
there is no revenue or income related to the acquired properties 
future development timing and production levels are expected to depend largely on the availability of additional export terminal capacity on the west coast and continued strong asian demand for thermal coal 
the volume of coal sold on a delivered basis is influenced by domestic and global market conditions 
domestic demand for coal sold on a delivered basis is currently flat while international demand has increased  enabling us to compete for international coal sales during the past few years 
coal sold on a delivered basis to customer contracted destinations  including sales to asian customers  involves us arranging and paying for logistics services  which can include rail  rail car hire  and port charges including any demurrage incurred and other costs 
these logistics costs are affected by volume  various scheduling considerations  and negotiated rates for rail and port services 
we are also incurring costs to investigate and pursue development of additional port opportunities 
we entered into coal forward contracts that are scheduled to settle at various dates between and to hedge a portion of our export coal sales 
current considerations owned and operated mines segment the lower demand for our coal during was primarily a result of the warm winter 
this resulted in lower electricity demand and lower natural gas prices that allowed utilities to opportunistically switch generation to gas 
as a result  during the first half of the year  utilities stockpiled a portion of their contracted coal 
while prb coal burn has recovered some ground as gas prices have risen  stockpiles are still at elevated levels 
in response to weak market conditions and reduced production  our operations focused successfully on controlling variable costs 
condition monitoring and planned maintenance programs continue to allow equipment lives to be extended and reduce maintenance costs without compromising equipment integrity 
costs were also managed by reducing the use of outside contractors  matching hiring to production and completing more maintenance and capital projects without using contractors 
for  our owned and operated mines segment is expected to experience relatively flat revenue compared to as realized prices are not expected to increase 
costs at the mines are expected to increase as the mines naturally progress and the increased strip ratio requires additional labor  consumables  and equipment 
the combination of these factors will reduce our earnings 
logistics and related activities segment as international coal prices fell our export deliveries were reduced as we curtailed shipments through the ridley terminal due to the greater rail costs for shipments through that terminal and focused on deliveries through the westshore terminal 
as a result of fewer tons being transported by us through the ridley terminal  which is over  miles from our mines and can require us to utilize up to three different rail carriers  we were able to reduce the costs of deliveries in compared to we are hopeful that reduced international production and growing demand will support prices later in we have held off pricing export coal for the second half of to allow us to benefit if prices do rise in the next few months 

table of contents on december   a vessel berthing at the westshore terminal collided with the trestle leading to their larger berth leaving it inoperable 
there were no vessels chartered or owned by us or our customers involved in the incident 
as a result the terminal capacity was reduced to below of the normal throughput  and we adjusted the timing of our westshore shipments and slowed production at our spring creek mine accordingly 
on february   westshore announced that repairs to the damaged trestle at berth were completed to permit resumption of normal operations at berth  and we expect to recommence shipments on this berth shortly 
federal  state and local authorities regulate the us coal mining industry with respect to matters  including air quality standards  water pollution  plant and wildlife protection  the discharge of materials into the environment and the effects of mining on surface and groundwater quality and availability 
these laws and regulations have had  and will continue to have  a significant effect on our production costs and our competitive position 
future laws  regulations or orders  including those relating to global climate change  may cause coal to become a less attractive fuel source  thereby reducing coal share of the market for fuels and other energy sources used to generate electricity

table of contents results of operations revenue the following table presents revenue in millions except per ton amounts year ended december  change amount percent owned and operated mines coal revenue realized price per ton sold tons sold other revenue logistics and related activities revenue corporate and other revenue eliminations of intersegment sales revenue total consolidated revenue the decrease in revenue from our owned and operated mines segment was the result of million fewer tons of coal sold in compared to  reflecting the lower demand for prb coal due to domestic utility customers working through higher stockpiles that resulted from the warmer than average winter of  as well as competitive pressures of low natural gas prices 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase to our realized price per ton sold in compared to  reflecting prices committed and fixed in earlier years 
since the fourth quarter of  coal prices have fallen due to the warm winter and low natural gas prices 
this will negatively impact our future realized prices 
other revenue consists primarily of dust suppressant additives billed to our customers 
revenue from our logistics and related activities segment increased primarily as a result of a higher volume of deliveries coordinated domestically partially offset by lower asian deliveries through the ports 
higher prices earned on both our domestic deliveries and our asian deliveries also contributed to the increase 
our asian delivered sales are priced broadly in line with a number of relevant international coal indices adjusted for energy content and other quality and delivery criteria 
these indices include the newcastle benchmark price  which is an established index for high btu australian thermal coal available to be loaded on a vessel at a coal terminal near newcastle  north of sydney 
based on the comparative quality and transport costs  our delivered sales are generally priced at approximately to of the forward newcastle price 
revenue from our corporate and other segment was down due to fewer broker coal sales in compared to revenue from the decker operation was not significantly different between the respective periods

the increase in the average cost per ton of coal sold is primarily the result of the impact of fixed costs on fewer tons sold 
other cost of product sold primarily consists of the cost of the dust suppressant additives included in other revenue 
cost of product sold for our logistics and related activities segment decreased primarily due to fewer asian deliveries through the ports  primarily through the ridley terminal  which required greater rail freight and port charges in this amount was partially offset by an increase in the volume of deliveries coordinated domestically and an increase in the related freight rate 
cost of product sold for our corporate and other segment decreased primarily due to fewer broker ton purchases offset by increased costs at the decker mine

table of contents in addition to the revenue and cost of product sold factors previously discussed  operating income for our owned and operated mines segment decreased due to a million nonrecurring reduction of depreciation and depletion expense during that was recognized when the asset retirement obligation for our antelope mine was adjusted as a result of the successful west antelope ii coal tract bids 
depreciation and depletion expense is expected to increase in the future as we mine into areas with higher cost coal 
in addition to the revenue and cost of product sold factors previously discussed  operating income for our logistics and related activities segment increased due to the increase in the favorable mark to market impact from our international coal forward contracts of million in as compared to a million favorable impact in as a result of declining international coal market prices

other cost of product sold primarily consists of the cost of the dust suppressant additives included in other revenue 
cost of product sold for our logistics and related activities segment increased primarily due to increases in volumes and freight rates on our coal sold on a delivered basis  including asian export sales 
cost of product sold for our corporate and other segment increased slightly due to higher costs per ton for broker sales and increased mining costs at the decker mine

table of contents services agreement  which concluded during depreciation and depletion expense decreased million due to the successful federal coal lease awards during which increased our antelope mine life by approximately years 
this reduced the discounted value of the future liability of the asset retirement obligation aro and the resulting non cash credit reduced depreciation and depletion expense as the change exceeded the carrying amount of the related asset retirement cost 
in addition to those factors previously discussed  operating income for our logistics and related activities segment increased due to in the favorable mark to market impact from our international coal forward contracts of million in in addition to those factors previously discussed  operating income for our corporate and other segment was not significantly different between respective periods

the effective tax rate for was also impacted by cpe resources change in status from an entity generally not subject to income taxes prior to the secondary offering to an entity that must now recognize taxes on a stand alone  separate return basis 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in millions cash and cash equivalents investments in marketable securities total in addition to our cash and cash equivalents  our primary sources of liquidity are cash from our operations  investments in marketable securities and borrowing capacity under cpe resources million revolving credit facility 
subsequent to year end  we executed an accounts receivable securitization facility a r securitization program with capacity of up to million and organized a capital leasing program that could grow over time up to million for some of our future capital equipment purchases 
these programs will allow us to add flexibility and liquidity into our capital structure 
for further details on the a r securitization program  see below 
cash from operations depends on a number of factors beyond our control  such as the market price for our coal  the quantity of coal required by our customers  coal fired electricity demand  regulatory changes and energy policies impacting our business  our costs of operating including the market price we pay for diesel fuel and other input costs  as well as costs of logistics including rail and port charges  and other risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in item a risk factors 
investments in marketable securities include highly liquid securities which are investment grade 
our investment policy has the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss and is intended to limit our credit exposure to any single issuer 
individual securities have various maturity dates  however  it is our expectation that we could sell any individual security in the secondary market at short notice allowing for improved liquidity 
on june   cpe resources entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the amended credit agreement which establishes a commitment to provide us with a million senior secured revolving credit facility that can be used to borrow funds or issue letters of credit 
the amended credit agreement matures on june  we may request incremental term loans or increase the revolving commitments in an aggregate amount of up to million subject to compliance with certain conditions 
the amended credit agreement imposes limitations on the ability of cpe resources and its subsidiaries to make distributions and or extend loans to cpe inc the indenture governing the senior notes also imposes limitations on the ability of cpe resources and its subsidiaries to make distributions  and to extend loans and advances  to cpe inc such limitations  taken as a whole  are less restrictive than those contained in the amended credit agreement 
cpe resources is required to make semi annual interest payments on its senior notes  which commenced on june  the limitations in both the amended credit agreement and the indenture have not had  nor are they expected to have  a negative impact upon our ability to fund cash obligations 
the borrowing capacity under the amended credit agreement is reduced by the amount of letters of credit issued 
as of december   our borrowing capacity under the amended credit agreement was million 
our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to the terms and conditions of the facility  including our compliance with financial and non financial covenants 
we believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our primary ordinary course uses of cash for the next months  which include our costs of coal production  coal lease installment payments for lbas 
table of contents and other coal tracts  capital expenditures  interest on our debt  and payments on the tax agreement liability 
on june   we completed our acquisition of the youngs creek project and related coal and surface assets  including cx ranch  from chevron and consol for million 
we utilized available cash on hand to fund the acquisition 
during  we made principal and interest payments totalling million on committed lbas 
we will continue to explore opportunities to increase our reserve base by acquiring additional coal and surface rights 
if we are successful in future bids for coal rights and other growth strategies  our cash flows could be significantly impacted as we would be required to make associated payments 
for existing lbas  we will make payments of million in our anticipated capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest and federal lease payments  which we expect will be between million and million in  include our estimates of expenditures necessary to keep our equipment fleets updated to maintain our mining productivity and competitive position and the addition of new equipment as necessary 
based on our estimates  we expect to make payments on the tax agreement liability of million in  payments averaging approximately million each year during to  and additional payments in subsequent years 
if we do not have sufficient resources from ongoing operations to satisfy our obligations or the timing of payments on our obligations does not coincide with cash inflows from operations  we may need to use our cash on hand and marketable securities or borrow under our line of credit 
if the obligation is in excess of these amounts  we may need to seek additional borrowing sources or take other actions 
depending upon existing circumstances at the time  we may not be able to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  our existing debt instruments contain restrictive covenants  which may prohibit us from borrowing under our revolving credit facility or pursuing certain alternatives to obtain additional funding 
cpe resources and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to the a r securitization program 
in january  we formed cpe receivables llc the spe  a special purpose  bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary to purchase  subject to certain exclusions  in a true sale  trade receivables generated by certain of our subsidiaries without recourse other than customary indemnification obligations for breaches of specific representations and warranties  and then transfer undivided interests in up to million of those accounts receivable to a financial institution for cash borrowings for our ultimate benefit 
there were no borrowings from the a r securitization program at the time of filing 
the spe is consolidated into our financial statements 
overview of cash transactions we started with million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
after capital expenditures and generating cash from our operating activities  we concluded the year ended december  with cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of million 
the million youngs creek project acquisition was funded utilizing available cash on hand 
during the year ended december   we were able to negotiate lower collateral requirements with the remainder of our surety bond providers thereby releasing the remaining million of restricted cash 
additionally  we replaced our million letter of credit that we used to secure our share of additional reclamation obligations at the decker mine with a million deposit to a decker reclamation trust  included within other long term assets 

table of contents cash flows year ended december  in millions beginning balance cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities ending balance cash and cash equivalents beginning balance marketable securities ending balance marketable securities included in net cash used in investing activities is the purchase of marketable securities which are highly liquid securities that are generally investment grade or better and are held as trading securities 
individual securities have various maturity dates  however  it is our expectation that we could sell any individual security in the secondary market allowing for improved liquidity 
cash flows of cpe inc and cpe resources are not significantly different 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from to was due to a decrease in net income as adjusted for noncash items and a decrease in working capital changes  primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and payments on the tax agreement liability partially offset by cash received from the settlement of derivative financial instruments 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was driven largely by the timing of payments made and the payment of lba interest 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from to was due to a decrease in working capital changes  primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and payments on the tax agreement liability partially offset by an increase in net income as adjusted for noncash items 
the increase in accounts receivable was driven largely by higher revenue in december as compared to december the increase in cash used in investing activities from to was primarily due to the acquisition of the youngs creek project  an increase in the cash paid for capitalized interest  and reduced restricted cash releases partially offset by a reduction in the cash paid for property  plant and equipment 
in addition  in  we made initial payments on federal coal leases of million and investments in marketable securities of million as compared to net investments of only million in the decrease in cash used in investing activities from to was primarily related to our surety bond obligations 
net restricted cash deposits of million occurred in the year ended december  compared to restricted cash releases of million in the year ended december  following a negotiated reduction of collateral required 
this decrease in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by increased purchases of property  plant and equipment  initial payments on federal coal lease obligations  and investments made in marketable securities 
purchases during the year ended december  for property  plant and equipment included payments for haul trucks received in  payments for surface land associated with federal and privately held mineral rights  and cash interest capitalized 
the increase in cash used in financing activities from to was primarily due to principal payments on federal coal leases of million in as compared to million in 
table of contents the decrease in cash used in financing activities from to primarily was due to distributions to rio tinto totaling million made in compared to none in partially offset by a small increase in the principal portion of payments on federal coal leases and the payment of debt issuance costs of million in related to our amended credit agreement 
senior notes we refer to the million senior notes due december  the notes and the million senior notes due december  the notes collectively as the senior notes 
the notes and notes bear interest at fixed annual rates of and  respectively 
there is no mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments for the senior notes and interest payments are due semi annually on june and december subject to certain limitations  we may redeem the notes by paying specified redemption prices in excess of their principal amount prior to december   or by paying their principal amount thereafter 
similarly  we may redeem the notes by paying specified redemption prices in excess of their principal amount prior to december   or by paying their principal amount thereafter

senior secured revolving credit facility on june   cpe resources entered into the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement establishes a commitment to provide us with a million senior secured revolving credit facility  which can be used to borrow funds or issue letters of credit 
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  we may elect to increase the size of the revolving credit facility and or request the addition of one or more new tranches of term loans in a combined amount of up to million 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of cpe resources assets and substantially all of the assets of certain of cpe resources subsidiaries  subject to certain permitted liens and customary exceptions for similar coal financings

table of contents federal coal lease obligations our federal coal lease obligations consist of amounts payable to the blm under leases  each of which require five equal annual payments 
the remaining aggregate annual payments under our existing federal coal leases were as follows as of december  in millions north maysdorf cordero rojo mine waii north antelope mine waii south antelope mine total we recognize imputed interest on federal coal leases based on an estimate of the credit adjusted  risk free rates reflecting our estimated credit rating at the inception of the lease 
the carrying value reported on our balance sheet of our federal coal lease obligations was million as of december  additional amounts may be incurred should we bid and win additional coal leases in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are party to a number of arrangements that secure our performance under certain legal obligations 
these arrangements include letters of credit and surety bonds 
we use these arrangements primarily to comply with federal and state laws that require us to secure the performance of certain long term obligations  such as mine closure or reclamation costs  coal lease obligations  state workers compensation  and federal black lung liabilities 
these arrangements are typically renewable annually 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we used surety bonds to secure outstanding obligations as follows in millions reclamation obligations lease obligations other obligations total off balance sheet obligations reclamation obligations include amounts to secure performance related to our outstanding obligations to reclaim areas disturbed by our mining activities and are a requirement under our state mining permits 
lease obligations include amounts generally required as a condition to state or federal coal leases  the amounts vary and are mandated by the governing agency 
other obligations include amounts required for exploration permits  water well construction and monitoring  exporting  and other miscellaneous items as mandated by applicable governing agencies 
our outstanding surety bonds in respect of our reclamation  lease and other obligations were million at december  including our obligations with respect to the decker mine of million and are required by law 
state statutes regulate and determine the calculation of the amounts of the bonds that we are required to hold 
we do not believe that these state mandated estimates are a true reflection of what our actual reclamation costs will be 
reclamation bond amounts represent an estimate of the near term reclamation liability that assumes reclamation activities will be 
table of contents performed by a third party during the next one to five years 
because this evaluation is near term  it is recalculated on a frequent basis  often annually 
the basis for calculating bond requirements is substantially different than the requirements that apply to the determination of our aro liability on our consolidated balance sheet  which is determined in accordance with us gaap 
the state calculates our specific bond requirements considering assumed costs that the state would incur if they were required to complete the reclamation on our behalf 
additionally  where a multi year bond  such as a three to five year bond  is put into place  the state regulatory authority requires that the reclamation liability be calculated for the highest cost scenario over that period 
the carrying amount of our reclamation obligations  as determined in accordance with us gaap  which are reported in our consolidated financial statements as aro liabilities  was million at december  including million with respect to the decker mine  million of which is classified as a current liability 
we estimate our aro liabilities based on disturbed acreage to date and the estimated cost of a third party to perform the work 
the estimated aro liabilities are also based on engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to the reclamation requirements 
we also assume that reclamation will be completed after the end of the mine life based on our current reclamation area profiles  which may be a different land disturbance assumption than the state requires  as we generally perform reclamation concurrently with our mining activities 
finally  the carrying amount of our aro liabilities reflects discounting of estimated reclamation costs using credit adjusted  risk free rates 
for a discussion of the risks relating to our reclamation obligations  see item a risk factors risks related to our business and industry if the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate  our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated 
because we are required by state and federal law to have these bonds or letters of credit in place before mining can commence  or continue  our failure to maintain surety bonds  letters of credit  or other guarantees or security arrangements would materially adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal 
that failure could result from a variety of factors including lack of availability  higher expense or unfavorable market terms  the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety and restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of any credit facility then in place

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item this table does not include our estimated aros 
as discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates asset retirement obligations below  the current and noncurrent carrying amount of our aros involves a number of estimates  including the amount and timing of the payments to satisfy these obligations 
the timing of payments is based on numerous factors  including projected mine closing dates 
based on our assumptions  the carrying amount of our aros excluding concurrent reclamation and amounts due in the current period as determined in accordance with us gaap is million as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item this table does not include our contractual obligations related to an agreement we entered into in april to purchase land adjacent to our antelope mine  whereby the seller may require us to pay a purchase price of up to million  which will close between april and april this table does not include payments that we expect to make on the tax agreement liability 
we have recognized a million liability for our estimated payments we expect to pay rtea  of which million and million is classified as current and noncurrent  respectively  as of december  the estimated liability is based on forecasts of future taxable income over the anticipated life of our mining operations and reclamation activities  assuming no additional coal reserves are acquired 
the assumptions used in our forecasts are subject to substantial uncertainty about our future business operations and the actual payments that we are required to make on the tax agreement liability could differ materially from our estimates 
based on our estimates as of december   we expect to make payments of million in  payments averaging approximately million each year during to and additional payments in subsequent years 
see item a risk factors other risks related to our corporate structure and common stock we are required to pay rtea for most of the tax benefits we may claim as a result of the tax basis step up we received in connection with the ipo  related ipo structuring transactions and secondary offering 
in certain cases  payments to rtea may be accelerated or exceed our actual cash tax savings 
these provisions may deter a change in control of our company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our judgments  estimates  and assumptions on historical information and other known factors that we deem relevant 
estimates are inherently subjective  as significant management judgment is required regarding the assumptions utilized to calculate accounting estimates in our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on variability in factors affecting these consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item this section describes those accounting policies and estimates that we believe are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from a sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is determinable  the product has been delivered  title has transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
some coal supply agreements provide for price adjustments based on variations in quality characteristics of the coal shipped 
in certain cases  a customer analysis of the coal quality is binding and the results of the analysis are received on a delayed basis 
in these cases  we estimate the amount of the quality adjustment and adjust the estimate to actual when the information is provided by the customer 
historically  such adjustments have not been material 
asset retirement obligations our aros arise from the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra and similar state statutes 
these regulations require that we  upon closure of a mine  restore the mine property in accordance with an approved reclamation plan issued in conjunction with our mining permit 
our aros are recorded initially using estimates of future third party costs 
to determine our aros  we calculate on a mine by mine basis the present value of estimated future reclamation cash flows based upon each mine permit requirements  estimates of the current disturbed acreage subject to reclamation  which is based upon approved mining plans  estimates of future reclamation costs  and assumptions regarding the mine productivity  which are based on engineering estimates that include estimates of volumes of earth and topsoil to be moved  the purchase and use of particular pieces of large mining equipment to move the earth  and the operating costs for those pieces of equipment 
these cash flow estimates are discounted at credit adjusted  risk free rates to arrive at a present value of estimated future reclamation costs 
upon initial recognition of the liability  a corresponding amount is capitalized as part of the carrying value of the related long lived asset 
the amount recorded as an aro for a mine may change as a result of mining permit changes granted by mining regulators  changes in the timing of mining activities and the mine productivity from original estimates and changes in the estimated costs or the timing of reclamation activities 
we periodically update estimates of cash expenditures to meet each mine reclamation requirements and we adjust the aro to fair value in accordance with us gaap  which generally requires a measurement of the present value of any change in estimated reclamation costs using credit adjusted  risk free rates 
if a reduction of the asset retirement obligation exceeds the carrying amount of the related asset retirement cost  the adjustment is recorded as a reduction of depletion expense 
annually  we analyze aros on a mine by mine basis and  if necessary  adjust the balance to take into account any changes in estimates 
in addition  on an interim basis  we may update the liability based on significant changes to the life of mine 
tax agreement liability we have recognized a tax agreement liability reflecting our estimate of the undiscounted amounts that we expect to pay to rtea under this agreement 
periodically  we adjust the liability based on an updated estimate of the amounts that we expect to pay  using assumptions consistent with those used in our concurrent estimate of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
these periodic adjustments to the tax agreement liability are reflected in our consolidated pretax income  and may also result in corresponding adjustments to our income tax expense and deferred income tax accounts 
increases in our estimates of future taxable income through  for example  acquisitions of additional coal reserves increase the likelihood of our future profitability  and therefore  are likely to increase our tax agreement liability and related deferred tax asset in the future 
although our periodic adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and tax agreement liability are based on consistent assumptions  the calculations required to determine these estimates differ in certain respects and the 
table of contents related adjustments will not have offsetting or proportionate effects on our earnings 
in addition  our estimates reflect assumptions about future events that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  our periodic adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the tax agreement liability may have material and unpredictable effects on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our customers generally respond to seasonal variations in electricity demand based upon the number of heating degree days and cooling degree days 
due to utility stockpile management  our coal sales do not experience the same direct seasonal volatility  however  extended mild weather patterns can impact the demand for our coal 
our sales typically benefit from decreases in customers stockpiles due to high electricity demand 
conversely  when these stockpiles increase  demand for our coal will typically soften 
further  our ability to deliver coal is impacted by the seasons 
for example  in the spring and summer of  the midwest region experienced severe flooding which disrupted rail service to mines in the prb and affected the ability of those customers who were impacted by the flooding to take coal deliveries 
global climate change enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the us or some of its states or by other countries  or other actions to limit such emissions  could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources 
additionally  the creation and issuance of subsidies designed to encourage use of alternative energy sources could decrease the demand of coal as an energy source 
the potential financial impact on us of future laws  regulations  or subsidies will depend upon the degree to which electricity generators diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source as a result of the laws  regulations or subsidies 
that  in turn  will depend on a number of factors  including the appeal and design of the subsidies being offered  the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations such as mandating use by utilities of renewable fuel sources  the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in and the state of commercial development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies 
in view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors  it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we define market risk as the risk of economic loss as a consequence of the adverse movement of market rates and prices 
we believe our principal market risks are commodity price risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
commodity price risk market risk includes the potential for changes in the market value of our coal portfolio 
historically  we have principally managed the commodity price risk for our coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements of varying terms and durations 
as of december   we had committed to sell approximately million tons during  of which 
table of contents million tons are under fixed price contracts 
a change to the average coal sales price per ton for these million unpriced tons would result in an approximate million change to the coal sales revenue 
in addition  we entered into certain forward financial contracts linked to newcastle coal prices to help manage our exposure to variability in future international coal prices 
as of december   we held coal forward contracts for approximately million tons which will settle between and a change to the market index price per ton for these coal forward contracts would result in an approximate million change to operating income 
we also face price risk involving other commodities used in our production process  primarily diesel fuel 
based on our projections of our usage of diesel fuel for the next months  and assuming that the average cost of diesel fuel increases by  we would incur additional fuel costs of approximately million over the next months 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we commenced the use of costless collars to manage certain exposures to diesel fuel prices 
as the band of the costless collar is greater than  it had no impact on this calculation 
the terms of the program are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item while we would not receive the full benefit of extreme price decreases  the collars mitigate the risk of extreme crude oil price increases and thereby increased diesel costs that would otherwise have a negative impact on cash flow 
interest rate risk our amended credit agreement is subject to an adjustable interest rate 
see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources senior secured revolving credit facility 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility as of december  if we borrow funds under the revolving credit facility  we may be subject to increased sensitivity to interest rate movements 
any future debt arrangements that we enter into may also have adjustable interest rates that may increase our sensitivity to interest rate movements 
credit risk we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by our counterparties  which may include end use customers  trading houses  brokers  and financial institutions that serve as counterparties to our derivative financial instruments and hold our investments 
we attempt to manage this exposure by entering into agreements with counterparties that meet our credit standards and that are expected to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
these steps may not always be effective in addressing counterparty credit risk 
when appropriate as determined by our credit management function  we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers that do not meet our credit standards or whose credit has deteriorated 
these steps include obtaining letters of credit and requiring prepayments for shipments 
see item a risk factors risks related to our business and industry we are exposed to counterparty risk with our customers  trading partners  financial institutions  and other parties with whom we conduct business
