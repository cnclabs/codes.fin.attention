non gaap measures in this document  we refer to various gaap us generally accepted accounting principles and non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies 
we present non gaap financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with additional analytical tools which we believe are useful in evaluating our operating results and the ongoing performance of our underlying businesses 
we do not  nor do we suggest that investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
non gaap measures we use include the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on net sales  gross profit  selling  general administrative sg a costs and operating profit  as well as the net sales  gross profit  sg a costs and operating profit excluding the impact of acquisitions 
as changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on our financial results  we believe excluding the effect of these changes assists in the assessment of our business results between periods 
we calculate the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes by translating the current period results at the rates that the comparable prior periods were translated to isolate the foreign exchange component of the fluctuation from the operational component 
similarly  the impact of changes in our results from acquisitions that were not included in comparable prior periods is subtracted from the absolute change in results to allow for better comparability of results between periods 
we calculate a non gaap measure of free cash flow as income from operations plus certain impairments and write downs  depreciation  amortization  proceeds from the sale of assets  plus or minus cash changes in working capital  customer advances and rental demo equipment and less capital expenditures 
we believe that the measure of free cash flow provides management and investors further information on cash generation or use 
we discuss forward looking information related to expected earnings per share eps excluding restructuring charges and other items 
this adjusted eps is a non gaap measure that provides guidance to investors about our expected eps excluding restructuring or other charges that we do not believe are reflective of our ongoing earnings 
working capital is calculated using the consolidated balance sheet amounts for trade receivables net of allowance plus inventories  less trade accounts payable and customer advances 
we view excessive working capital as an inefficient use of resources  and seek to minimize the level of investment without adversely impacting the ongoing operations of the business 
trailing three month annualized net sales is calculated using the net sales for the most recent quarter multiplied by four 
the ratio calculated by dividing working capital by trailing three months annualized net sales is a non gaap measure that we believe measures our resource use efficiency 
non gaap measures we use also include net operating profit after tax nopat as adjusted  income loss before income taxes as adjusted  income loss from operations as adjusted  benefit from provision for income taxes as adjusted and stockholders equity as adjusted  which are used in the calculation of our after tax return on invested capital roic collectively the non gaap measures  which are discussed in detail below 
overview we made significant progress in our goals were margin improvement  cash generation and integration of demag cranes ag and our performance reflected the attention given to these goals 
although we were impacted in the second half of the year by challenging markets in europe and asia  net sales increased moderately  primarily due to acquisitions  and our income from operations increased substantially year over year 
our income from operations increased by over million in we accomplished this improvement by focusing on margins and containing costs  as actions taken in continued to have a favorable impact on our current results 
see note l restructuring and other charges in our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of our restructuring activities  including the reasons  timing and costs associated with such actions 
we generated free cash flow of approximately million in  significantly more than the million in free cash flow generated in we have made good progress in the integration of our demag cranes ag acquisition and believe we will exceed in the originally targeted million in annual savings 
we also expect to realize the benefits of realigning our port equipment business into the mhps segment  which will provide our port and rail customers with a single source of access to our extensive portfolio of products 
we also took several important steps during to further improve our capital structure and operating results by reducing interest expense through purchasing approximately of our convertible notes  redeeming our senior notes and refinancing our senior subordinated notes with senior notes 
in addition  we amended our credit agreement in october to  among other things  reduce our interest rates 
see note m long term obligations in our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding these actions 
while we generally achieved the overall performance we expected for  the mix of performance among the segments was varied 
our results match the trends we have observed on a macroeconomic level with the market environment for some of our categories of equipment showing pockets of strength and others showing weakened demand 
three segments performed well in and we expect this to continue in our awp segment continued to see strong replacement demand for its products in the north american rental channel as well as some evidence of fleet growth and delivered double digit operating margins for the full year 
our cranes segment experienced continued strong performance in certain products and regions and our mp operating performance remained solid 
both of these segments delivered double digit operating margins in the fourth quarter of our two remaining segments did not perform as well in  but we are actively managing these businesses to improve performance 
we have made good progress in integrating our mhps segment 
benefits are expected from cost synergies globally to help offset weak european markets 
we believe the weak markets should stabilize in and the benefits of the big port projects we have won are expected to be seen in our results in the second half of and although our construction segment returned to profitability in the first half of  we had a difficult second half in as market conditions began to soften  particularly in europe  and we took and continue to take strategic actions to improve our performance 
we recently announced an agreement to sell or exit the majority of our roadbuilding product lines 
in addition  we plan to exit a number of compact construction component manufacturing businesses in germany 
many of these businesses were generating poor returns and we expect these actions to improve operating results 
we will continue to rationalize costs in our construction businesses while pursuing non traditional distribution channels  such as the recently announced supply agreement with takeuchi 
we are seeing improvements in many of our end markets and believe the macro economic uncertainty that affected our fourth quarter performance will abate by the middle of we anticipate a good portion of this improvement to come from our awp segment where we expect increased price realization and increased net sales volume 
for  we are expecting the awp operating margin to be in the to range 
in the construction segment we are expecting a to operating margin as we do not expect too much benefit from divestitures and restructuring until later in the year 
in the cranes segment  we are anticipating a to operating margin as we expect to benefit from the cost reductions and margin improvement efforts that took place in we do not expect significant margin improvements in the mhps segment in  but we are expecting operating margins of to 
we also anticipate that there will be further changes during the year that adapt the structural cost to the realities of the current market for this segment and there may be some charges for these changes that we have not yet anticipated 
in the mp segment  we are expecting an to operating margin 
entering  we remain committed to profitable growth  generating cash and realizing the integration benefits of mhps 
when balancing the different demand environments in each of our businesses  we are expecting earnings per share to be between and excluding restructuring and unusual items on net sales of between billion and billion 
similar to  we expect to generate more than million in free cash flow during  with an aim to reduce outstanding indebtedness 
we expect a tax rate of  which is slightly higher than the rate in  due to increased income in higher tax jurisdictions  particularly the united states 
other expense is anticipated to be approximately million  which includes the demag cranes shareholder guaranteed payment  debt amortization costs and other items 
our estimated average share count is expected to be approximately million shares 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
cash taxes are expected to be approximately million 
we have also established a earnings per share goal of from billion in net sales and with a return on invested capital 
these are internal goals for the company and not guidance 
roic continues to be the unifying metric that we use to measure our operating performance 
roic and the non gaap measures assist in showing how effectively we utilize the capital invested in our operations 
after tax roic is determined by dividing the sum of nopat for each of the previous four quarters by the average of the sum of total terex corporation stockholders equity plus debt as defined below less cash and cash equivalents for the previous five quarters 
nopat for each quarter is calculated by multiplying income loss from continuing operations by a figure equal to one minus the effective tax rate of the company 
we believe that returns on capital deployed in tfs do not represent management of our primary operations and  therefore  tfs finance receivable assets and results from operations have been excluded from the non gaap measures 
additionally  we do not believe that the realized and deferred gains on marketable securities reflects our operations and  therefore  such gains have been excluded from the calculation of the non gaap measures 
the effective tax rate is equal to the provision for benefit from income taxes divided by income loss before income taxes for the respective quarter 
total terex corporation stockholders equity is adjusted to include redeemable noncontrolling interest as this item is deemed to be temporary equity and therefore should be included in the denominator of the roic ratio 
debt is calculated using the amounts for notes payable and current portion of long term debt plus long term debt  less current portion 
we calculate roic using the last four quarters nopat as this represents the most recent month period at any given point of determination 
in order for the denominator of the roic ratio to properly match the operational period reflected in the numerator  we include the average of five quarters ending balance sheet amounts so that the denominator includes the average of the opening through ending balances on a quarterly basis thereby providing  over the same time period as the numerator  four quarters of average invested capital 
terex management and the board of directors use roic as one of the primary measures to assess operational performance  including in connection with certain compensation programs 
we use roic as a unifying metric because we believe that it measures how effectively we invest our capital and provides a better measure to compare ourselves to peer companies to assist in assessing how we drive operational improvement 
we believe that roic measures return on the amount of capital invested in our primary businesses  excluding tfs  as opposed to another metric such as return on stockholders equity that only incorporates book equity  and is thus a more accurate and descriptive measure of our performance 
we also believe that adding debt less cash and cash equivalents to total stockholders equity provides a better comparison across similar businesses regarding total capitalization  and roic highlights the level of value creation as a percentage of capital invested 
as the tables below show  our roic at december  was

corporate eliminations of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales loss from operations the net sales amounts include the elimination of intercompany sales activity among segments 
loss from operations increased from the prior year period primarily due to increased spending on developing markets 
interest expense  net of interest income during the year ended december   our interest expense net of interest income was million  or million higher than the prior year 
this increase was primarily driven by increased interest expense associated with the demag cranes ag acquisition related debt 
loss on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december   we repaid the outstanding principal amount of our notes  our notes and purchased approximately of the principal amount outstanding of our convertible notes due see note m long term obligations 
the million loss on early extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  includes a cash payments of million for call premiums and expenses associated with the repayment of outstanding debt  b million of non cash charges for accelerated amortization of debt acquisition costs and original issue discount associated with the debt extinguished  and c a million gain related to the termination of the swap agreement associated with the redemption of the notes  which are included in the calculation of net income

other income expense net other income expense net for the year ended december  was income of million  a decrease of million when compared to income of million in the prior year 
the change was primarily driven by a gain in the prior year period of approximately million from the sale of shares in bucyrus international 
this was partially offset by approximately million of charges in the prior year period related to the acquisition of demag crane ag 
income taxes during the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of million on income of million  an effective tax rate of  as compared to an income tax expense of million on income of million  an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  the lower effective tax rate for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to reductions in the provision for uncertain tax positions and losses for which no tax benefit was recognized 
income loss from discontinued operations we had income from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  primarily due to resolution of certain items associated with the results of the mining business prior to divestiture 
gain loss on disposition of discontinued operations for the year ended december   we recognized a loss associated with settlement of claims related to the sale of the mining business offset in part by a gain recognized due to tax related adjustments on the net gain on divestiture of businesses sold in for the year ended december   we recognized a gain due to tax related adjustments on the net gain on divestiture of businesses sold in compared with terex consolidated of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income loss from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales for the year ended december  increased  million when compared to the same period in excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes and the addition of the demag cranes acquisition  net sales increased approximately from the prior year period

excluding the impact of the demag cranes acquisition and foreign exchange effects  sg a costs increased by approximately million due to increased selling costs associated with higher sales  higher marketing costs from certain trade show activities  increased engineering costs for new product development and impairment charges related to manufacturing footprint rationalization 
income loss from operations improved by million for the year ended december  versus the comparable period in excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes and the demag cranes acquisition  income from operations increased approximately million 
the increase was due to the items noted above  particularly improved net sales volume offset partially by higher sg a costs 
aerial work platforms of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales for the awp segment for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in adjusting for the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  net sales increased approximately from the comparable prior year period 
the north american market showed strong growth as the large rental companies continued to replace the equipment in their fleets 
the independent rental firms began to increase their purchases  but at a slower rate than anticipated 
utilization rates of customer fleets remained high  a positive sign of the strength of the replacement cycle despite the continuing soft market conditions in construction applications 
internationally  the demand for and acceptance of aerial work platforms continued to expand steadily  also contributing to the increased sales versus the prior year period 
additionally  benefits were beginning to be captured from price increases that were implemented late in the first half of in all geographies 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in increased net sales  favorable product mix and higher production levels  partially offset by higher material costs  contributed approximately million to the improvement in gross profit 
the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes increased gross profit by approximately million from the prior year period 
these improvements were offset by approximately million in higher transactional foreign currency expenses  inventory charges and other costs of sales

the improvement in net sales was driven by strong demand for backhoe loaders in russia  compact equipment in central europe and trucks in developing markets including  russia and south africa 
demand for material handlers continued to be strong especially in central europe  the segment s largest market for this type of machinery 
slow demand for roadbuilding products in north america continued due to weak highway infrastructure spending 
the tightening in government sponsored financing programs constrained roadbuilding demand in brazil 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased million when compared to the same period in increased net sales  offset partially by higher material costs  improved gross profit by approximately million 
lower inventory write downs and lower restructuring charges in the current year period improved gross profit by approximately million 
lower other costs of sales  particularly for distribution and other non manufacturing costs improved gross profit by approximately million

cranes of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income from operations net sales for the cranes segment for the year ended december  increased by million when compared to the same period in adjusting for the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  net sales increased approximately from the comparable prior year period 
many of our crane categories experienced increased sales over the prior year  with rough terrain cranes and pick and carry cranes being the largest contributors to the sales growth 
sales in the us increased by approximately and the business experienced stronger demand in china  india and germany 
however  tower crane demand was generally stagnant and the truck cranes business in china experienced a significant decrease in demand 
gross profit for the year ended december  decreased by million when compared to the same period in the unfavorable effect of product sales mix and higher material costs negatively impacted gross profit by approximately million 
inventory write downs  primarily related to manufacturing footprint rationalization  decreased gross profit in the period by approximately million 
these decreases in gross profit were partially offset by higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs of approximately million when compared to the prior year period 
additionally  the decrease in gross profit was partially offset by the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  which increased gross profit by approximately million from the prior year period 
sg a costs for the year ended december  increased million versus the same period in the higher allocation of corporate costs increased sg a costs by approximately million 
the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes increased sg a costs by approximately million from the prior year period 
income from operations for the year ended december  decreased million versus the same period in  resulting primarily from the negative impact of higher material costs and the unfavorable effect of product sales mix 
material handling port solutions of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a loss from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales for the mhps segment for the period ended december  was  million and increased by million when compared to the same period in  primarily due to the impact of results from the demag cranes acquisition 
net sales were driven by strength in europe  particularly germany 
increasing demand for industrial cranes as well as for mobile harbor cranes positively impacted net sales in the period 
part sales were a meaningful contributor to net sales  as higher capacity utilization at customer plants led to an increasing need for services and spare parts 
net sales from our port equipment business increased approximately million in the current year compared to the prior year primarily due to an improved global economic environment 
gross profit for the period ended december  was million and increased by million when compared to the same period in  primarily due to the impact of results from the demag cranes acquisition 
these results included charges of approximately million related to the revaluation of inventory at the acquisition date of demag cranes ag and million related primarily to the incremental amortization of tangible and intangible assets 
gross profit in the port equipment business decreased approximately million in the current year when compared with the prior year  primarily due to restructuring charges related to manufacturing footprint rationalization 
sg a costs for the period ended december  were million and increased by million when compared to the same period in  primarily due to the impact of results from the demag cranes acquisition 
sg a costs in the port equipment business increased approximately million in the current year when compared with the prior year  primarily due to restructuring  asset impairment and related charges associated with manufacturing footprint rationalization 
loss from operations for the period ended december  was million and increased by million when compared to the same period in  primarily due to the impact of results from the demag cranes acquisition 
these results included charges of approximately million related to the revaluation of inventory at the acquisition date of demag cranes ag and million related primarily to the incremental amortization of tangible and intangible assets 
additionally  higher costs associated with restructuring costs related to manufacturing footprint rationalization contributed to the larger loss 
materials processing of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales gross profit sg a income loss from operations not meaningful as a percentage net sales in the mp segment increased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in adjusting for the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  net sales increased approximately from the comparable prior year period 
machine and parts sales continued to increase in most markets with the exception of southern europe where customers have experienced difficulties in obtaining financing 
new mobile machines with increased capacities continued to drive sales as they gain acceptance in the market and approach capacities of static equipment 
this increase was slightly offset by a slowdown in net sales recently experienced in the crushing equipment market 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased by million when compared to the same period in the increase was primarily due to the impact of increased net sales and favorable product sales mix  which increased gross profit by approximately million 
the favorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes increased gross profit by approximately million from the prior year period 
sg a costs for the year ended december  increased million over the same period in  primarily due to the higher allocation of corporate costs of approximately million and the unfavorable translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  which increased sg a costs by approximately million from the prior year period 
income loss from operations for the year ended december  improved million when compared to  primarily due to higher net sales volume partially offset by higher sg a costs 
corporate eliminations of sales of sales change in reported amounts amounts in millions net sales income loss from operations the net sales amounts include the elimination of intercompany sales activity among segments 
loss from operations improved from the prior year period primarily due to the impact of higher corporate expense allocation to all of the segments of approximately million combined with lower restructuring costs  cost reduction activities and improved margins from government sales and other activities in the current year period 
interest expense  net of interest income during the year ended december   our interest expense net of interest income was million  or million lower than the prior year 
this decrease was primarily driven by reduced interest expense due to the retirement of debt over the past year 
loss on early extinguishment of debt on january   we exercised our early redemption option and repaid the outstanding million principal amount of our notes 
the cash paid to redeem the notes included a call premium of million 
additionally  we recorded non cash charges of million for the write off of unamortized costs  including debt issuance costs  original issue discount and interest rate swap costs  in connection with the repayment of the notes 
in august  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that replaced our previous credit agreement 
the termination of our previous credit agreement resulted in non cash charges for accelerated amortization of debt acquisition costs of million in the current year period 
other income expense net other income expense net for the year ended december  was income of million  an increase of million when compared to expense of million in the prior year 
the change was primarily driven by income in the current year period of approximately million from the sale of approximately million shares of bucyrus common stock 
charges related to the acquisition of demag cranes ag totaling approximately million were partially offset by lower expense of approximately million in the current year period associated with derivative instruments 
income taxes during the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of million on income of million  an effective rate of  as compared to an income tax benefit of million on a loss of million  an effective rate of  for the year ended december  the higher tax rate recorded in  compared to statutory tax rates  was mainly due to non tax benefitted losses and non tax deductible expenses incurred to acquire demag cranes ag and the enactment of a statutory income tax rate reduction in the uk  which caused a reduction in value in our uk deferred tax assets 
the decrease in the absolute amount of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  caused items of income tax expense and benefit for to have a more significant impact than in when a loss from continuing operations before income tax instead of income from continuing operations before income tax is reported  tax expense items decrease the effective tax rate and tax benefit items increase the effective tax rate 
income loss from discontinued operations we had income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  primarily due to tax related items associated with the results of the mining business prior to divestiture 
in the year ended december   we had losses from discontinued operations primarily due to the results of the atlas business prior to divestiture 
gain loss on disposition of discontinued operations for the year ended december   we recognized a gain due to tax related adjustments on the net gain on divestiture of businesses sold in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on our financial results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are among our most significant accounting policies which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events and which utilize estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and therefore are based on management judgment 
please refer to note a basis of presentation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm value 
cost is determined principally by the average cost method and the first in  first out fifo method approximately and  respectively 
in valuing inventory  we are required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions require us to analyze the aging of and forecasted demand for our inventory  forecast future products sales prices  pricing trends and margins  and to make judgments and estimates regarding obsolete or excess inventory 
future product sales prices  pricing trends and margins are based on the best available information at that time including actual orders received  negotiations with our customers for future orders  including their plans for expenditures  and market trends for similar products 
our judgments and estimates for excess or obsolete inventory are based on analysis of actual and forecasted usage 
the valuation of used equipment taken in trade from customers requires us to use the best information available to determine the value of the equipment to potential customers 
this value is subject to change based on numerous conditions 
inventory reserves are established taking into account age  frequency of use  or sale  and in the case of repair parts  the installed base of machines 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events that could significantly influence our judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where our products are sold  new equipment price fluctuations  actions of our competitors  including the introduction of new products and technological advances  as well as new products and design changes we introduce 
we make adjustments to our inventory reserve based on the identification of specific situations and increase our inventory reserves accordingly 
as further changes in future economic or industry conditions occur  we will revise the estimates that were used to calculate its inventory reserves 
at december   reserves for lcm  excess and obsolete inventory totaled million 
if actual conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  we will increase our reserves for lcm  excess and obsolete inventory accordingly 
any increase in our reserves will adversely impact our results of operations 
the establishment of a reserve for lcm  excess and obsolete inventory establishes a new cost basis in the inventory 
such reserves are not reduced until the product is sold 
accounts receivable we are required to judge our ability to collect accounts receivable from our customers 
valuation of receivables includes evaluating customer payment histories  customer leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
at december   reserves for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable totaled million 
given current economic conditions  there can be no assurance that our historical accounts receivable collection experience will be indicative of future results 
guarantees as of december   we have issued guarantees to financial institutions related to customer financing of equipment purchases by our customers 
we must assess the probability of losses or non performance in ways similar to the evaluation of accounts receivable  including consideration of a customer s payment history  leverage  availability of third party financing  political and exchange risks  and other factors 
many of these factors  including the assessment of a customer s ability to pay  are influenced by economic and market factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
our customers  from time to time  may fund acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is limited to the remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of customer default  we have generally been able to recover and dispose of the equipment at a minimum loss  if any  to us 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by terex cranes germany gmbh  part of the cranes segment and genie holdings  inc and its affiliates genie  part of the awp segment  of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
there can be no assurance that our historical credit default experience will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in effect at the time of loss 
we issue residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future point in time 
as described in note q litigations and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december  we are generally able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million  including total guarantees issued by genie of million and the mhps segment of million 
we are generally able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we record a liability for the estimated fair value of guarantees issued pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  guarantees asc 
we recognize a loss under a guarantee when our obligation to make payment under the guarantee is probable and the amount of the loss can be estimated 
a loss would be recognized if our payment obligation under the guarantee exceeds the value we could expect to recover to offset such payment  primarily through the sale of the equipment underlying the guarantee 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  there can be no assurances that our historical experience in used equipment markets will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses experienced from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in the used equipment markets at the time of loss 
revenue recognition revenue and related costs are generally recorded when products are shipped and invoiced to either independently owned and operated dealers or to customers 
revenue generated in the united states is recognized when title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers  which generally occurs upon shipment depending upon the shipping terms negotiated 
we also have a policy requiring that certain criteria be met in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  c collectability is reasonably assured  and d we have no significant obligations for future performance 
in the united states  we have the ability to enter into a security agreement and receive a security interest in the product by filing an appropriate uniform commercial code ucc financing statement 
however  a significant portion of our revenue is generated outside of the united states 
in many countries outside of the united states  as a matter of statutory law  a seller retains title to a product until payment is made 
the laws do not provide for a seller s retention of a security interest in goods in the same manner as established in the ucc 
in these countries  we retain title to goods delivered to a customer until the customer makes payment so that we can recover the goods in the event of customer default on payment 
in these circumstances  where we only retain title to secure our recovery in the event of customer default  we also have a policy  which requires meeting certain criteria in order to recognize revenue  including satisfaction of the following requirements a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectability is reasonably assured  e we have no significant obligations for future performance  and f we are not entitled to direct the disposition of the goods  cannot rescind the transaction  cannot prohibit the customer from moving  selling  or otherwise using the goods in the ordinary course of business and have no other rights of holding title that rest with a titleholder of property that is subject to a lien under the ucc 
in circumstances where the sales transaction requires acceptance by the customer for items such as testing on site  installation  trial period or performance criteria  revenue is not recognized unless the following criteria have been met a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  d collectability is reasonably assured  and e the customer has given their acceptance  the time period for acceptance has elapsed or we have otherwise objectively demonstrated that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
in addition to performance commitments  we analyze factors such as the reason for the purchase to determine if revenue should be recognized 
this analysis is done before the product is shipped and includes the evaluation of factors that may affect the conclusion related to the revenue recognition criteria as follows a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  c the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and d collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized at the inception of the lease 
income from operating leases is recognized ratably over the term of the lease 
we routinely sell equipment subject to operating leases and the related lease payments 
if we do not retain a substantial risk of ownership in the equipment  the transaction is recorded as a sale 
if we do retain a substantial risk of ownership  the transaction is recorded as a borrowing  the operating lease payments are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease and the debt is amortized over a similar period 
we  from time to time  issue buyback guarantees in conjunction with certain sales agreements 
these primarily relate to trade value agreements tvas in which a customer may trade in equipment in the future at a stated price credit if the customer meets certain conditions 
the trade in price credit is determined at the time of the original sale of equipment 
in conjunction with the trade in  these conditions include a requirement to purchase new equipment at fair market value at the time of trade in  which fair value is required to be of equal or greater value than the original equipment cost 
other conditions also include the general functionality and state of repair of the machine 
we have concluded that any credit provided to customers under a tva buyback guarantee  which is expected to be equal to or less than the fair value of the equipment returned on the trade in date  is a guarantee to be accounted for in accordance with asc the original sale of equipment  accompanied by a buyback guarantee  is a multiple element transaction wherein we offer our customer the right  after some period of time  for a limited period of time  to exchange purchased equipment for a fixed price trade in credit toward another of our products 
the fixed price trade in credit is accounted for under the guidance provided by asc pursuant to this right  we have agreed to make a payment in the form of a trade in credit to the customer contingent upon the customer exercising its right to trade in the original purchased equipment 
under the guidance of asc  we record the fixed price trade in credit at its fair value 
accordingly  as noted above  we have accounted for the trade in credit as a separate deliverable in a multiple element arrangement 
when a sales transaction includes multiple deliverables  such as sales of multiple products or sales of products and services that are delivered over multiple reporting periods  the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the units of accounting  and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price 
the selling price of a unit of accounting is determined using a selling price hierarchy 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe is established based upon the price charged for products and services that are sold separately in standalone transactions 
if vsoe cannot be established  third party evidence tpe is evaluated based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
if neither vsoe or tpe is available  management best estimate of selling price is established based upon the price at which we would sell the product on a standalone basis taking into consideration factors including  but not limited to  internal costs  gross margin objectives  pricing practices and market conditions 
revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met 
goodwill goodwill  representing the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of assets tangible and intangible and liabilities at the date of acquisition  is reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently as circumstances warrant  and written down only in the period in which the recorded value of such assets exceed their fair value 
we selected october as the date for our required annual impairment test 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information with similar economic characteristics is available and the operating results are regularly reviewed by our management 
the awp  construction  cranes and mp operating segments plus the material handling business including services and port solutions business of mhps  comprise the six reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use an income approach derived from the discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
the aggregate fair value of our reporting units is compared to our market capitalization on the valuation date to assess its reasonableness 
the initial recognition of goodwill  as well as the annual review of the carrying value of goodwill  requires that we develop estimates of future business performance 
these estimates are used to derive expected cash flow and include assumptions regarding future sales levels and the level of working capital needed to support a given business 
we rely on data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
the discounted cash flow model also includes a determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
the cost of capital is based on assumptions about interest rates as well as a risk adjusted rate of return required by our equity investors 
changes in these estimates can impact the present value of the expected cash flow that is used in determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets as well as the overall expected value of a given business 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
we adopted fasb accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic  asu at the beginning of the fourth quarter of on a prospective basis 
see recent accounting pronouncements below 
asu allows us to first assess  qualitatively  whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if we believe  as a result of our qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test is required 
we have the unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the two step goodwill impairment test 
there were no indicators of goodwill impairment in the tests performed as of october   and see note j goodwill and intangible assets  net in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of any quantitative fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of any reporting unit calculated 
this hypothetical decrease would still result in excess fair value over carrying value for the reporting units as of october  impairment of long lived assets our policy is to assess the realizability of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if fair value based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions regarding future sales levels and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
we use data developed by business segment management as well as macroeconomic data in making these calculations 
there are no assurances that future cash flow assumptions will be achieved 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
we recognized asset impairments of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  was recognized as part of restructuring costs 
see note l restructuring and other charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued warranties we record accruals for unasserted warranty claims based on our claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
however  adjustments to the initial warranty accrual are recorded if actual claim experience indicates that adjustments are necessary 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty  including the performance of new products  models and technology  changes in weather conditions for product operation  different uses for products and other similar factors 
accrued product liability we record accruals for product liability claims when deemed probable and estimable based on facts and circumstances and our prior claim experience 
accruals for product liability claims are valued based upon our prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside legal counsel  analysis of internal product liability counsel and the experience of our product safety team 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables such as the decisions of juries or judges 
defined benefit plans pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements 
as of december   we maintained one qualified defined benefit pension plan and one nonqualified plan covering certain us employees 
the benefits covering salaried employees are based primarily on years of service and employees qualifying compensation during the final years of employment 
the benefits covering bargaining unit employees are based primarily on years of service and a flat dollar amount per year of service 
participation in the qualified plan is frozen and participants are only credited with post freeze service for purposes of determining vesting and retirement eligibility 
it is our policy  generally  to fund the qualified us plan based on the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of see note o retirement plans and other benefits in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the nonqualified plan provides retirement benefits to certain senior executives of the company and is unfunded 
generally  the nonqualified plan provides a benefit based on average total compensation earned over a participant s final five years of employment and years of service reduced by benefits earned under any company retirement program  excluding salary deferrals and matching contributions 
in addition  benefits are reduced by social security primary insurance amounts attributable to company contributions 
participation in the nonqualified plan was frozen effective december   however  eligible participants are credited with post freeze service for purposes of determining vesting and the amount of benefits 
we maintain defined benefit plans in france  germany  india  switzerland and the united kingdom uk for some of our subsidiaries 
the plans in france  germany and india are unfunded plans 
during  the plan in the uk was frozen 
for our operations in austria  italy and korea there are mandatory termination indemnity plans providing a benefit that is payable upon termination of employment in substantially all cases of termination 
we record this obligation based on the mandated requirements 
the measure of the current obligation is not dependent on the employees future service and therefore is measured at current value 
plan assets consist primarily of common stocks  bonds and short term cash equivalent funds 
for the us plan  approximately of the assets are in equity securities and are in fixed income securities 
for the non us funded plans  approximately of the assets are in equity securities  are in fixed income securities and are in real estate investment securities 
these allocations are reviewed periodically and updated to meet the long term goals of the plans 
determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated expenses requires the use of actuarial valuations to estimate the benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefits 
we use the services of independent actuaries to assist with these calculations 
inherent in these valuations are economic assumptions  including expected returns on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities may be settled  rates of increase of health care costs  rates of future compensation increases as well as employee demographic assumptions such as retirement patterns  mortality and turnover 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions used are recorded as unrecognized gains and losses 
unrecognized gains and losses that exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets are amortized to earnings over the shorter of the estimated future service period of the plan participants or the period until any anticipated final plan settlements 
the assumptions used in the actuarial models are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect experience 
we believe the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which we operate 
expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were for the us plan  for the us plan and for the swiss plan at december  our strategy with regard to the investments in the pension plans is to earn a rate of return sufficient to match or exceed the long term growth of pension liabilities 
the expected rate of return of plan assets represents an estimate of long term returns on the investment portfolio 
these rates are determined annually by management based on a weighted average of current and historical market trends  historical portfolio performance and the portfolio mix of investments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december is used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
the discount rates for pension plan liabilities were for us plan and to with a weighted average of for non us plans at december  the discount rate enables us to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
the rate used reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments at the december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects on the subsequent year 
typically  a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the expected rates of compensation increase for our non us pension plans were to with a weighted average of at december  these estimated annual compensation increases are determined by management every year and are based on historical trends and market indices 
we have recorded the underfunded status on our balance sheet as a liability and the unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial gains losses as an adjustment to stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
the change in assumptions from the previous year  primarily decreases in the discount rate  resulted in a net increase in the projected benefit obligation of million 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the market value of plan assets can change significantly in a relatively short period of time 
additionally  the measurement of plan benefit obligations is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as a result  if the equity market declines and or interest rates decrease  the plans estimated benefit obligations could increase  causing an increase in liabilities and a reduction in stockholders equity 
we expect that any future obligations under our plans that are not currently funded will be funded from future cash flows from operations 
if our contributions are insufficient to adequately fund the plans to cover our future obligations  or if the performance of the assets in our plans does not meet expectations  or if our assumptions are modified  contributions could be higher than expected  which would reduce cash available for our business 
changes in us or foreign laws governing these plans could require additional contributions 
in addition  changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the us could require recording additional liabilities and costs related to these plans 
assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a change in each assumption below would have the following effects upon net pension expense and projected benefit obligation  respectively  as of and for the year ended december  increase decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return discount rate expected long term rate of return amounts in millions u

plan net pension expense projected benefit obligation non us plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes we estimate income taxes based on enacted tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which represent future tax benefits or obligations of our legal entities 
these deferred income tax balances arise from temporary differences due to divergent treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character  amount and timing to result in the use of our deferred tax assets 
character refers to the type ordinary income versus capital gain as well as the source foreign vs 
domestic of the income we generate 
timing refers to the period in which future income is expected to be generated 
timing is important because  in certain jurisdictions  net operating losses nols and other tax attributes expire if not used within an established statutory time frame 
based on these evaluations  we have determined that it is more likely than not that expected future earnings will be sufficient to use most of our deferred tax assets 
we do not provide for income taxes or tax benefits on the differences between financial reporting basis and tax basis of our non us subsidiaries where such differences are reinvested and  in our opinion  will continue to be indefinitely reinvested 
if earnings of foreign subsidiaries are not considered indefinitely reinvested  deferred us income taxes  foreign income taxes  and foreign withholding taxes may have to be provided 
we do not record deferred income taxes on the temporary difference between the book and tax basis in domestic subsidiaries where permissible 
at this time  determination of the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to the investment in subsidiaries is not practical 
judgments and estimates are required to determine tax expense and deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing uncertain tax positions 
tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge tax filing positions we take 
our practice is to file income tax returns that conform to the requirements of each jurisdiction and to record provisions for tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  in accordance with asc  income taxes 
as our business has grown in geographic scope  size and complexity  so has our potential exposure to uncertain tax positions 
given the subjective nature of applicable tax laws  the results of an audit of some of our tax returns could have a significant impact on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  which amended asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
this guidance addresses efforts to achieve convergence between us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs requirements for measurement of and disclosures about fair value 
key provisions of the amendment include a prohibition on grouping financial instruments for purposes of determining fair value  except when an entity manages market and credit risks on the basis of the entity s net exposure to the group  an extension of the prohibition against the use of a blockage factor to all fair value measurements that prohibition currently applies only to financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets  and a requirement that for recurring level fair value measurements  entities disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs  a description of the valuation process used and qualitative details about the sensitivity of the measurements 
in addition  for items not carried at fair value but for which fair value is disclosed  entities will be required to disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy that applies to the fair value measurement disclosed 
this guidance was effective for us in our interim and annual reporting periods beginning january  adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income asc topic presentation of comprehensive income  asu which amended previous comprehensive income guidance 
this accounting update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
instead  we must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu  asu 
asu defers the requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements 
asu and were effective for us on january  since the provisions of asu and are presentation related only  adoption of asu and did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in december  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  asu

liquidity and capital resources our main sources of funding are cash generated from operations  loans from our bank credit facilities  and funds raised in capital markets 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  the majority of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries is expected to be maintained locally because we plan to reinvest such cash and cash equivalents to support our operations and continued growth plans outside the united states through funding of capital expenditures  acquisitions  operating expenses or other similar cash needs of these operations 
such cash could be used in the us  if necessary 
cash repatriated to the us could be subject to incremental local and us taxation 
currently  there are no trends  demands or uncertainties as a result of the company s cash re investment policy that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on us as a whole or that may be relevant to our financial flexibility 
we believe cash generated from operations together with access to our bank credit facilities and cash on hand  provide adequate liquidity to continue to support our internal operating initiatives and meet our operating and debt service requirements 
see item a risk factors for a detailed description of the risks resulting from our debt and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business 
in august  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that replaced our previous credit agreement 
we further amended that credit agreement in october see note m long term obligations 
the credit agreement provided us with a million term loan and a million term loan that we used  along with other cash  to pay for the shares of demag cranes ag and all related fees and expenses 
the term loans are scheduled to mature on april  in addition  our credit facilities provide us with a revolving line of credit of up to million 
the revolving line of credit consists of million of available domestic revolving loans and million of available multicurrency revolving loans 
the revolving lines of credit are scheduled to mature on april  we had million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities at december  the credit agreement also allows incremental commitments  which may be extended at the option of the lenders and can be in the form of revolving credit commitments  term loan commitments  or a combination of both as long as we satisfy a secured debt financial ratio contained in the credit facilities 
on march  the demag cranes ag shareholders approved the domination and profit and loss transfer agreement dpla we entered into with demag cranes ag in january the dpla became effective following registration of the dpla in the commercial register on april  upon demand from outside shareholders of demag cranes ag  we will acquire their shares in return for per share  or up to approximately million in the aggregate 
any outside shareholders of demag cranes ag that choose not to sell their shares to us will receive an annual guaranteed payment in the gross amount of per share net per share 
for further information on the time period for outside shareholders of demag cranes ag to tender their shares  see note p stockholders equity in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   approximately thousand shares have been tendered and we have paid approximately million for these tendered shares 
following the effectiveness of the dpla the lenders under the demag cranes credit agreement exercised their option to terminate the agreement 
we repaid all million debt outstanding on may  and provided bank guarantees or cash collateral to backstop any letters of credit outstanding under the facility by may  the facility was terminated on may  on march   we sold and issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due notes at par which yielded approximately million of net proceeds after underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses 
we used the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes  including cash requirements resulting from the effectiveness of the dpla 
in the third quarter of  we purchased approximately of the principal amount outstanding of our convertible notes due for approximately million  including million of accrued interest 
these purchases reduced the balance of the convertible notes outstanding by million  resulting in a loss on early retirement of debt of million and a reduction in equity of million 
in september of  we repaid million principal amount outstanding of our senior notes 
total cash paid to redeem the senior notes was million which included a make whole call premium of as calculated under the indenture for the senior notes  totaling million plus accrued interest of million 
this transaction resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
in november  we sold and issued million aggregate principal of senior notes due notes at par which yielded approximately million of net proceeds after underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses 
we used the net proceeds from this offering plus other cash to redeem all million principal amount of our outstanding notes 
total cash paid to redeem the notes was million and included tender call premiums of million and accrued interest of million 
these transactions resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
we increased our investment in financial services assets from approximately million  net at december   to approximately million  net at december  we remain focused on expanding tfs in key markets like the us  europe and china  however  for the near future  we expect to rely to a greater extent on third party funders 
during  our cash used in inventory was approximately million 
we are continuing to share  throughout our company  best practices and lean manufacturing processes that several of our business units have implemented successfully 
we expect these initiatives to reduce the level of inventory needed to support our business and allow us to reduce our manufacturing lead times  thereby reducing our working capital requirements 
working capital as percent of trailing three month annualized net sales was at december  we have changed the definition of working capital to include advance payments as we negotiate these receipts to fund inventory for products with long lead times 
we expect the ratio of working capital to trailing three months annualized sales to be approximately at the end of the following tables show the calculation of our working capital and trailing three months annualized sales as of december  in millions three months ended net sales x trailing three month annualized net sales as of inventories trade receivables less trade accounts payable less customer advances total working capital we are continuing to focus on generating cash  including increasing prices for our products  reducing costs and working capital  reviewing alternatives for under utilized assets  and selectively investing in our businesses to promote growth in we generated approximately million in free cash flow in  which was in line with our expectations 
additionally  similar to  we expect to generate more than million in free cash flow during the following table reconciles income from operations to free cash flow in millions year ended income from operations plus depreciation and amortization plus non cash note receivable write down plus proceeds from sale of assets plus minus cash changes in working capital plus minus customer advances less capital expenditures free cash flow our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to numerous factors  including the following many of our customers fund their purchases through third party finance companies that extend credit based on the credit worthiness of the customers and the expected residual value of our equipment 
changes either in the customers credit profile or used equipment values may affect the ability of customers to purchase equipment 
there can be no assurance that third party finance companies will continue to extend credit to our customers as they have in the past 
as our sales change  the absolute amount of working capital needed to support our business may change 
our suppliers extend payment terms to us based on our overall credit rating 
declines in our credit rating may influence suppliers willingness to extend terms and in turn increase the cash requirements of our business 
sales of our products are subject to general economic conditions  weather  competition  the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes  and other factors that in many cases are outside our direct control 
for example  during periods of economic uncertainty  our customers have delayed purchasing decisions  which reduces cash generated from operations 
for certain products  primarily port equipment and process cranes  we negotiate  when possible  advance payments from our customers for products with long lead times to help fund the substantial working capital investment in these products 
typically  we have invested our cash in a combination of highly rated  liquid money market funds and in short term bank deposits with large  highly rated banks 
our investment objective is to preserve capital and liquidity while earning a market rate of interest 
in and  we used a portion of our cash balance to take advantage of early payment discounts offered by our suppliers where the returns were greater than the amount that would have been earned on such cash if invested in money market funds and short term bank deposits 
we expect to continue this practice in  although we may discontinue it at any time 
interest rates charged under our bank credit facilities are subject to adjustment based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and million in us dollar and euro denominated term loans outstanding at december  the us dollar term loans bear interest at a rate of london interbank offer rate libor plus  with a floor of on libor 
the euro term loans bear interest at a rate of euro interbank offer rate euribor plus  with a floor of on euribor 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on these term loans was 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a balance between fixed and floating rate debt  including the use of interest rate derivatives when appropriate 
over the long term  we believe this mix will produce lower interest cost than a purely fixed rate mix while reducing interest rate risk 
the revolving line of credit under our credit facility expires in april our convertible senior subordinated notes mature in june  our senior notes mature april  and our senior notes mature may  see note m long term obligations  in our consolidated financial statements 
our ability to access the capital markets to raise funds  through the sale of equity or debt securities  is subject to various factors  some specific to us  and others related to general economic and or financial market conditions 
these include results of operations  projected operating results for future periods and debt to equity leverage 
in november  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec to allow for easier access to the capital markets 
our ability to access the capital markets is also subject to our timely filing of periodic reports with the sec 
in addition  the terms of our bank credit facilities  senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain restrictions on our ability to make further borrowings and to sell substantial portions of our assets 
cash flows cash provided by operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december  the change in cash from operations was primarily driven by improvements in profitability and reduced working capital usage in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
these net improvements were partially offset by approximately million in tax payments in the year ended december  related to the gain on the sale of the former mining business and receipt of an approximately million tax refund in the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  the change in cash from investing activities was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of bucyrus international shares in the prior year offset by the purchase of demag cranes ag in the prior year 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  of million 
the change was primarily due to net cash used in the current year period for repayments of the notes  repayment of the demag cranes ag credit facility  purchase of approximately of the convertible notes and repayment of the notes  partially offset by the issuance of the and notes 
this compared to net proceeds from the issuance of term debt under our credit facilities to purchase demag cranes ag  partially offset by repayment of the notes in the prior year 
contractual obligations the following table sets out our specified contractual obligations at december  in millions payments due by period total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations include non cancellable and cancellable commitments 
in many cases  cancellable commitments contain penalty provisions for cancellation 
long term debt obligations include expected interest expense 
interest expense is calculated using fixed interest rates for indebtedness that has fixed rates and the implied forward rates as of december  for indebtedness that has floating interest rates 
as of december   our liability for uncertain income tax positions was million 
with respect to our tax audits worldwide  it is reasonably possible that we will make payments in of up to million 
payments may be made in part to mitigate the accrual of interest in connection with income tax audit assessments that may be issued and that we would contest  or may in part be made to settle the matter with the tax authorities 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the remaining liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid 
additionally  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit that totaled million and had issued million in credit guarantees of customer financing to purchase equipment  million in residual value guarantees and million in buyback guarantees 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans for some of our operations in the united states and europe 
it is our policy to fund the retirement plans at the minimum level required by applicable regulations 
in  we made cash contributions and payments to the retirement plans of million  and we estimate that our retirement plan contributions will be approximately million in changes in market conditions  changes in our funding levels or actions by governmental agencies may result in accelerated funding requirements in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees our customers  from time to time  fund the acquisition of our equipment through third party finance companies 
in certain instances  we may provide a credit guarantee to the finance company by which we agree to make payments to the finance company should the customer default 
our maximum liability is generally limited to our customer s remaining payments due to the finance company at the time of default 
in the event of a customer default  we are generally able to recover and dispose of the equipment at a minimum loss  if any  to us 
as of december   our maximum exposure to such credit guarantees was million  including total credit guarantees issued by terex cranes germany gmbh  part of our cranes segment  and genie  part of our awp segment  of million and million  respectively 
the terms of these guarantees coincide with the financing arranged by the customer and generally do not exceed five years 
given our position as the original equipment manufacturer and our knowledge of end markets  when called upon to fulfill a guarantee  we have generally been able to liquidate the financed equipment at a minimal loss  if any 
there can be no assurance that historical credit default experience will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in effect at the time of loss 
we issue  from time to time  residual value guarantees under sales type leases 
a residual value guarantee involves a guarantee that a piece of equipment will have a minimum fair market value at a future date 
as described in note q litigations and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our maximum exposure related to residual value guarantees under sales type leases was million at december  we are generally able to mitigate the risk associated with these guarantees because the maturity of the guarantees is staggered  which limits the amount of used equipment entering the marketplace at any one time 
we guarantee  from time to time  that we will buy equipment from our customers in the future at a stated price if certain conditions are met by the customer 
such guarantees are referred to as buyback guarantees 
these conditions generally pertain to the functionality and state of repair of the machine 
as of december   our maximum exposure pursuant to buyback guarantees was million 
we are generally able to mitigate the risk of these guarantees by staggering the timing of the buybacks and through leveraging our access to the used equipment markets provided by our original equipment manufacturer status 
we have recorded an aggregate liability within other current liabilities and other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet of approximately million for the estimated fair value of all guarantees provided as of december  there can be no assurance that our historical experience in used equipment markets will be indicative of future results 
our ability to recover losses from our guarantees may be affected by economic conditions in the used equipment markets at the time of loss 
contingencies and uncertainties foreign currencies and interest rate risk our products are sold in over countries around the world and  accordingly  our revenues are generated in foreign currencies  while the costs associated with those revenues are only partly incurred in the same currencies 
the major foreign currencies  among others  in which we do business are the euro  australian dollar and british pound 
we may  from time to time  hedge specifically identified committed and forecasted cash flows in foreign currencies using forward currency sale or purchase contracts 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of million 
we manage exposure to interest rates by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintaining an ongoing balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness using interest rate swaps when necessary 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for a discussion of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates may have on our financial performance 
certain of our obligations  including our senior subordinated notes  bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of the principal amount of our notes to floating rates 
in november  this agreement was terminated and we received approximately million upon termination 
this amount was recorded as a gain on early extinguishment of debt in connection with the repayment of the notes 
in a prior year  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our notes 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
we recorded this loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and amortized it through january   when we repaid the outstanding portion of the notes 
other we are subject to a number of contingencies and uncertainties including  without limitation  product liability claims  intellectual property claims  self insurance obligations  tax examinations  guarantees  class action lawsuits and the matters described above in item legal proceedings 
we are insured for product liability  general liability  workers compensation  employer s liability  property damage  intellectual property and other insurable risk required by law or contract with retained liability to us or deductibles 
many of the exposures are unasserted or proceedings are at a preliminary stage  and it is not presently possible to estimate the amount or timing of any of our costs 
however  we do not believe that these contingencies and uncertainties will  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our operations 
for contingencies and uncertainties other than income taxes  when it is probable that a loss will be incurred and possible to make reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to such matters  a provision is recorded for the amount of such estimate or for the minimum amount of a range of estimates when it is not possible to estimate the amount within the range that is most likely to occur 
we generate hazardous and non hazardous wastes in the normal course of our manufacturing operations 
as a result  we are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations 
all of our employees are required to obey all health  safety and environmental laws and regulations and must observe the proper safety rules and environmental practices in work situations 
these laws and regulations govern actions that may have adverse environmental effects  such as discharges to air and water  and require compliance with certain practices when handling and disposing of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
these laws and regulations would also impose liability for the costs of  and damages resulting from  cleaning up sites  past spills  disposals and other releases of hazardous substances  should any of such events occur 
we are committed to complying with these standards and monitoring our workplaces to determine if equipment  machinery and facilities meet specified safety standards 
each of our facilities is subject to an environmental audit at least once every three years to monitor compliance and no incidents have occurred which required us to pay material amounts to comply with such laws and regulations 
we are dedicated to seeing that safety and health hazards are adequately addressed through appropriate work practices  training and procedures 
for example  we have reduced lost time injuries in the workplace since and we continue to work toward a world class level of safety practices in our industry 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of our ongoing business operations and we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions 
for further information on accounting policies related to derivative financial instruments  refer to note k derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange risk we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases and sales  intercompany product shipments and intercompany loans 
we are also exposed to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments 
additionally  we are exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency earnings to us dollars 
primary exposures include the us dollar when compared to functional currencies of our major markets  which include the euro  australian dollar and british pound 
we assess foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows  identify naturally offsetting positions and purchase hedging instruments to partially offset anticipated exposures 
at december   we had foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of million 
the fair market value of these arrangements  which represents the cost to settle these contracts  was a net loss of million at december  at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis on the impact that aggregate changes in the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes would have on our operating income 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that a change in the value of the us dollar relative to currencies outside the us by to amounts already incorporated in the financial statements for the year ended december  would have had an approximately million impact on the translation effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes already included in our reported operating income for the period 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt and existing issuances of variable rate debt 
primary exposure includes movements in the us prime rate  libor and euribor 
we manage interest rate risk by incurring a mix of indebtedness bearing interest at both floating and fixed rates at inception and maintain an ongoing balance between floating and fixed rates on this mix of indebtedness using interest rate swaps when necessary 
at december   approximately of our debt was floating rate debt and the weighted average interest rate for all debt was approximately 
certain of our obligations bear interest at a fixed interest rate 
in november  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert million of the principal amount of our notes to floating rates 
in november  this agreement was terminated and we received million upon termination 
this amount was recorded as a gain on early extinguishment of debt in connection with the repayment of the notes 
in a prior year  we entered into an interest rate agreement to convert a fixed rate to a floating rate with respect to million of the principal amount of our notes 
to maintain an appropriate balance between floating and fixed rate obligations on our mix of debt  we exited this interest rate swap agreement on january  and paid million 
we recorded this loss as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged debt and amortized it through january   which was the effective date that the hedged debt was extinguished 
at december   we performed a sensitivity analysis for our derivatives and other financial instruments that have interest rate risk 
we calculated the pretax earnings effect on our interest sensitive instruments 
based on this sensitivity analysis  we have determined that an increase of in our average floating interest rates at december  would have increased interest expense by approximately million for the year ended december  commodities risk principal materials and components that we use in our manufacturing processes include steel  castings  engines  tires  hydraulics  cylinders  drive trains  electric controls and motors  and a variety of other commodities and fabricated or manufactured items 
extreme movements in the cost and availability of these materials and components may affect our financial performance 
in  input cost increases in tires and certain purchased components were generally offset by reductions in steel prices and competitive sourcing activities 
we did incur some net material cost increases as a result of legislation primarily tier emission standards and performance based changes in certain product areas  particularly engines 
in the absence of labor strikes or other unusual circumstances  substantially all materials and components are normally available from multiple suppliers 
however  certain of our businesses receive materials and components from a single source supplier  although alternative suppliers of such materials may be generally available 
current and potential suppliers are evaluated regularly on their ability to meet our requirements and standards 
we actively manage our material supply sourcing  and employ various methods to limit risk associated with commodity cost fluctuations and availability 
the inability of suppliers  especially any single source suppliers for a particular business  to deliver materials and components promptly could result in production delays and increased costs to manufacture our products 
we have designed and implemented plans to mitigate the impact of these risks by using alternate suppliers  expanding our supply base globally  leveraging our overall purchasing volumes to obtain favorable quantities and developing a closer working relationship with key suppliers 
we are focusing on gaining efficiencies with suppliers based on our global purchasing power and resources
