item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in items and of this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements  which include statements concerning future revenue sources and concentration  gross profit margins  selling and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  capital resources  additional financings or borrowings and additional losses  are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k  particularly in item a risk factors  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
the forward looking statements set forth in this form k are as of the close of business on march   and we undertake no duty and do not intend to update this information 
overview we develop  manufacture  market  sell and support veterinary products 
our business is comprised of two reportable segments  core companion animal health cca  which represented of our revenue and other vaccines  pharmaceuticals and products ovp  which represented of our revenue 
the core companion animal health segment includes diagnostic and other instruments and supplies as well as single use diagnostic and other tests  pharmaceuticals and vaccines  primarily for canine and feline use 
blood testing and other non imaging instruments and supplies represent approximately of our revenue 
many products in this area involve placing an instrument in the field and generating future revenue from consumables  including items such as supplies and service  as that instrument is used 
approximately of our revenue resulted from the sale of such consumables to an installed base of instruments and approximately of our revenue was from new hardware 
a loss of or disruption in supply of consumables we are selling to an installed base of instruments could substantially harm our business 
all of our blood testing and other non imaging instruments and supplies are furnished to us by third parties  who typically own the product rights and sell the product to us under marketing and or distribution agreements 
in many cases  we have collaborated with a third party to adapt a human instrument for veterinary use 
major products in this area include our chemistry instruments  our hematology instruments and our blood gas instruments and their affiliated operating consumables 
revenue from products in these three areas  including revenue from consumables  represents approximately of our revenue 
other cca revenue  including single use diagnostic and other tests  pharmaceuticals and vaccines as well as research and development  licensing and royalty revenue  represented approximately of our revenue 
since items in this area are single use by their nature  our aim is to build customer satisfaction and loyalty for each product  generate repeat annual sales from existing customers and expand our customer base in the future 
products in this area are both supplied by third parties and provided by us 
major products in this area include our heartworm diagnostic tests  our heartworm preventive  our allergy test kits  our allergy immunotherapy and our allergy diagnostic tests 
combined revenue from heartworm related products and allergy related products represented approximately of our revenue 
we consider the cca segment to be our core business and devote most of our management time and other resources to improving the prospects for this segment 
maintaining a continuing  reliable and economic supply of products we currently obtain from third parties is critical to our success in this area 
virtually all of our sales and marketing expenses are in the core companion animal health segment 
the majority of our research and development spending is dedicated to this segment  as well 
we strive to provide high value products and advance the state of veterinary medicine 

table of contents all our cca products ultimately are sold primarily to or through veterinarians 
in many cases  veterinarians will mark up their costs to the end user 
the acceptance of our products by veterinarians is critical to our success 
cca products are sold directly by us as well as through distribution relationships  such as our corporate agreement with merck animal health  the sale of kits to conduct blood testing to third party veterinary diagnostic laboratories and independent third party distributors 
revenue from direct sales and distribution relationships represented approximately and of core companion animal health revenue  respectively 
we intend to increase profitability through a combination of revenue growth  gross margin improvement and expense control 
accordingly  we closely monitor revenue growth trends in our cca segment 
revenue in this segment increased by million  or  in as compared to we believe poor economic conditions over the past several years have impacted our revenue as  for example  veterinarians have continued to delay or defer capital expenditures on new diagnostic instrumentation 
the other vaccines  pharmaceuticals and products segment includes our  square foot usda and fda licensed production facility in des moines  iowa 
we view this facility as an asset which will allow us to control our cost of goods on any vaccines and pharmaceuticals that we may commercialize in the future 
virtually all our us inventory is now stored at this facility and most fulfillment logistics are managed there 
cca segment products manufactured at this facility are transferred at cost and are not recorded as revenue for our ovp segment 
we view ovp reported revenue as revenue primarily to cover the overhead costs of the facility and to generate incremental cash flow to fund our cca segment 
our ovp segment includes private label vaccine and pharmaceutical production  primarily for cattle but also for other animals such as small mammals 
all ovp products are sold by third parties under third party labels 
we have developed our own line of bovine vaccines that are licensed by the usda 
we have a long term  non exclusive agreement with a distributor  agrilabs  for the marketing and sale of certain of these vaccines which are sold primarily under the titanium and masterguard brands which are registered trademarks of agrilabs 
this agreement generates a significant portion of our ovp segment s revenue 
our ovp segment also produces vaccines and pharmaceuticals for other third parties 
our february  we acquired a majority interest in cuattro veterinary usa  llc  which has been renamed heska imaging us  llc 
this acquisition marks our entry into the veterinary imaging area 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we have identified those critical accounting policies used in reporting our financial position and results of operations based upon a consideration of those accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessment 
we consider the following to be our critical policies 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate our revenue through the sale of products  as well as through licensing of technology product rights  royalties and sponsored research and development 
our policy is to recognize revenue when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met  which generally include the following persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized after both the goods are shipped to the customer and acceptance has been received  if required  with an appropriate provision for estimated returns and allowances 
it is not our normal practice to accept customer returns 
certain of our products have expiration dates 
our policy is to exchange certain outdated  expired product with the same product 
we record an accrual for the estimated cost of replacing the expired product expected to be returned in the future  based on our historical experience  adjusted for any known factors that reasonably could be expected to change historical patterns  such as regulatory actions which allow us to extend the shelf life of our products 
revenue from both direct sales to veterinarians and sales to independent third party distributors are generally recognized when goods are shipped 
our products are shipped complete and ready to use by the customer 
the terms of the customer arrangements generally pass title and risk of ownership to the customer at the time of shipment 
certain customer arrangements provide for acceptance provisions 
revenue for these arrangements is not recognized until the acceptance has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed 
we reduce our revenue by the estimated cost of any rebates  allowances or similar programs  which are used as promotional programs 
recording revenue from the sale of products involves the use of estimates and management judgment 
we must make a determination at the time of sale whether the customer has the ability to make payments in accordance with arrangements 
while we do utilize past payment history  and  to the extent available for new customers  public credit information in making our assessment  the determination of whether collectability is reasonably assured is ultimately a judgment decision that must be made by management 
we must also make estimates regarding our future obligation relating to returns  rebates  allowances and similar other programs 
license revenue under arrangements to sell or license product rights or technology rights is recognized as obligations under the agreement are satisfied  which generally occurs over a period of time 
generally  licensing revenue is deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the related agreements  products  patents or technology 
nonrefundable licensing fees  marketing rights and milestone payments received under contractual arrangements are deferred and recognized over the remaining contractual term using the straight line method 
recording revenue from license arrangements involves the use of estimates 
the primary estimate made by management is determining the useful life of the related agreement  product  patent or technology 
we evaluate all of our licensing arrangements by estimating the useful life of either the product or the technology  the length of the agreement or the legal patent life and defer the revenue for recognition over the appropriate period 

table of contents occasionally we enter into arrangements that include multiple elements 
such arrangements may include the licensing of technology and manufacturing of product 
in these situations we must determine whether the various elements meet the criteria to be accounted for as separate elements 
if the elements cannot be separated  revenue is recognized once revenue recognition criteria for the entire arrangement have been met or over the period that the company s obligations to the customer are fulfilled  as appropriate 
if the elements are determined to be separable  the revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on relative fair value and recognized separately for each element when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in accounting for these multiple element arrangements  we must make determinations about whether elements can be accounted for separately and make estimates regarding their relative fair values 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on client specific allowances  as well as a general allowance 
specific allowances are maintained for clients which are determined to have a high degree of collectability risk based on such factors  among others  as i the aging of the accounts receivable balance  ii the client s past payment experience  iii a deterioration in the client s financial condition  evidenced by weak financial condition and or continued poor operating results  reduced credit ratings  and or a bankruptcy filing 
in addition to the specific allowance  the company maintains a general allowance for credit risk in its accounts receivable which is not covered by a specific allowance 
the general allowance is established based on such factors  among others  as i the total balance of the outstanding accounts receivable  including considerations of the aging categories of those accounts receivable  ii past history of uncollectable accounts receivable write offs  and iii the overall creditworthiness of the client base 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realizability of accounts receivable 
should any of the factors considered in determining the adequacy of the overall allowance change  an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts receivable may be necessary 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
inventories are written down if the estimated net realizable value of an inventory item is less than its recorded value 
we review the carrying cost of our inventories by product each quarter to determine the adequacy of our reserves for obsolescence 
in accounting for inventories we must make estimates regarding the estimated net realizable value of our inventory 
this estimate is based  in part  on our forecasts of future sales and shelf life of product 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance our deferred tax assets  such as an nol  are reduced by an offsetting valuation allowance based on judgmental assessment of available evidence if we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all of the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
if we are able to conclude it is more likely than not that we will realize a future benefit from a deferred tax asset  we will reduce the related valuation allowance by an amount equal to the estimated quantity of income taxes we would pay in cash if we were not to utilize the deferred tax asset in the future 
the first time this occurs in a given jurisdiction  it will result in a net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet and an income tax benefit of equal magnitude in our statement of operations in the period we make the determination 
in future periods  we will then recognize as income tax expense the estimated quantity of income taxes we would have paid in cash had we not utilized the related deferred tax asset 
the corresponding journal entry will be a reduction of our deferred tax asset 
if there is a change regarding our tax position in the future  we will make a corresponding adjustment to the related valuation allowance

cca segment revenue increased to million in compared to million in key factors in the increase were greater sales of our instrument consumables  our canine heartworm preventive and international sales of our canine heartworm diagnostic tests  somewhat offset by lower revenue from our hematology instruments and our chemistry instruments 
ovp segment revenue decreased to million in compared to million in lower sales of cattle vaccines under our contract with agrilabs and lower international sales of cattle vaccines were factors in the decline 
ovp segment revenue increased to million in compared to million in greater sales of cattle vaccines to new customers  greater sales of cattle vaccines under our contract with agrilabs and greater sales of other cattle vaccines  somewhat offset by lower sales of bulk bovine biologicals  were key factors in the increase 
we expect total revenue  which we expect to include the revenue attributable to heska imaging for full months of  to increase as compared with 
table of contents cost of revenue cost of revenue was million  an increase of compared to million in gross profit increased to million in from million in gross margin  ie gross profit divided by total revenue  increased to in from in a key factor in the increase was product mix  where the overall sales shift was toward higher margin products including instrument consumables 
cost of revenue was million  an increase of compared to million in gross profit increased to million in from million in gross margin  ie gross profit divided by total revenue  increased to in from in the largest factor was approximately million in net costs for destroyed product  replacement product and related reserves in our ovp segment regarding regulatory issues with certain of our cattle vaccines which was recognized in  but not operating expenses selling and marketing expenses increased by to million in compared to million in higher costs related to increases in sales force personnel contributed to the increase 
selling and marketing expenses increased by to million in compared to million in greater recruiting and relocation costs related to the expansion of our sales force and increased spending related to product marketing programs were factors in the increase 
research and development expenses decreased by approximately thousand to thousand in from million in the largest factor in the change was lower payments to third parties related to product collaborations in the period as compared to the period 
research and development expenses increased by thousand to million in from million in a factor in the increase was a payment to a third party related to a product line we are collaborating to develop with that company 
general and administrative expenses were million in  a increase as compared to million in a favorable arbitration ruling in where the other side paid our legal costs along with increased legal spending in were factors in the increase 
general and administrative expenses were million in  a increase as compared to million in the largest factor in the increase was a management incentive plan mip expense in related to the achievement of certain objectives  which did not occur in interest and other expense  net interest and other expense  net  was an expense of thousand in  as compared to income of thousand in and an expense of thousand in this line item can be broken into two components net interest expense and net foreign currency gains and losses 
net interest was expense of thousand in  as compared to income of thousand in and expense of thousand in the largest factor in the change from to and from to was thousand in interest income from an arbitration judgment in we recognized interest income in an arbitration judgment in but it was not at the same level as net foreign currency losses were thousand in  thousand in and thousand in we expect interest and other expense  net to be a net expense in as we have a thousand minimum interest expense under our agreement with wells fargo and we do not anticipate we will experience interest income at the same level as in and  which resulted primarily from interest awarded in arbitration judgments 

table of contents income tax expense benefit in  we had total income tax expense of thousand  including thousand in domestic deferred income tax expense  a non cash expense  and thousand in current income tax expense  the majority of which related to state income taxes 
in  we had total income tax expense of million  including million in domestic deferred income tax expense  and thousand in current income tax expense  the majority of which related to state income taxes 
in  we had thousand of current tax expense and thousand in deferred tax benefit  resulting in total income tax expense of thousand 
the largest component of current tax expense relates to the profitable operating performance of our swiss subsidiary 
domestically  the effect of permanent differences between tax and gaap accounting  such as incentive stock option amortization  at low profitability levels tends to raise the implied tax rate and contributed to our unusually high tax rate in the same effect occurred to some degree in and  although its impact declined as the profitability level increased 
in  we expect higher income tax expense as compared to as we expect higher pre tax income in  which we expect to include the pre tax income attributable to heska imaging for full months of  as compared to net income loss our net income was million as compared to net income of million and net income of thousand in increased operating expenses  somewhat offset by higher revenue and improved gross margin  was the most important factor in the decline from to increased revenue and improved gross margin  somewhat offset by higher operating expenses  were key factors in the improvement from to we expect net income will be higher in  which we expect to include the net income attributable to heska imaging for full months of  than in liquidity  capital resources and financial condition we have incurred net cumulative negative cash flow from operations since our inception in for the year ended december   we had net income of million 
in  net cash used in operations was thousand 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  working capital of million and million outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit  discussed below 
net cash flows from operating activities used cash of thousand in as compared to providing cash of million in  a change of million 
the largest factor in the change was a million decrease in cash provided from accounts receivable as in we had a significant level of our products ship to customers prior to year end  without such customers paying prior to year end  an effect which was not present to the same degree in in addition  our lower profitability level in as compared to  with a thousand decline in cash from net income and a related thousand decline in cash provided by deferred tax expense  contributed to the decline 
a million refundable prepayment for exclusive negotiating rights on a potential acquisition in but not also contributed to the change 
we also experienced thousand greater cash used in inventory primarily related to increased transfers of inventory to property and equipment for our instruments installed with customers where we have retained instrument ownership as well as thousand less cash provided by lower depreciation and amortization expense  primarily related to lower depreciation on instrument units available for customer rental which were fully depreciated in this was somewhat offset by million in cash from accounts payable  accrued liabilities and other items resulting to some degree from the increase in our operating expenses as compared to 
table of contents net cash flows from operating activities provided cash of million in as compared to million in key factors in the change were an improvement of million in net income  a million increase in cash provided by deferred tax expense  which is a non cash charge  and a thousand improvement in cash provided by accounts receivable  with the payment resulting from arbitration in the fourth quarter of as a key factor in this change 
these were somewhat offset by thousand greater cash used by accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other  related to the timing of payments  and thousand in lower depreciation and amortization expense  primarily related to lower depreciation on instrument units available for customer rental 
net cash flows from investing activities used cash of million in as compared to using cash of million in and using cash of thousand in purchases of property and equipment increased thousand in as compared to and thousand in as compared to  primarily due to greater property and equipment purchases in our ovp segment in both cases 
net cash flows from financing activities provided cash of million in  used cash of million in and used cash of million in in  we borrowed million and received thousand in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and upon option exercises  somewhat offset by funds paid to participating shareholders in our odd lot tender offer for shareholders with shares or less 
these cash flows were somewhat offset by million in dividends we paid 
in  we used cash to fully repay our remaining million in line of credit borrowings  which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and upon option exercises 
in  we used cash to reduce our borrowings under our line of credit by million and repay the remaining principal on term debt of thousand  which was partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and upon option exercises 
in  we essentially borrowed under our line of credit to finance dividends paid to shareholders  our capital expenditures and cash used in our operating activities 
we repaid more debt under our revolving line of credit in as compared to primarily because we had greater cash provided by operating activities in as compared to at december   we had a million asset based revolving line of credit with wells fargo which has a maturity date of december  at december   there were million of borrowings outstanding on this line of credit 
our ability to borrow under this line of credit varies based upon available cash  eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory 
based on our agreement with wells fargo  on december   any interest on borrowings due was to be charged at a stated rate of three month libor plus and was to be payable monthly 
we expect any interest on borrowings due after february to be charged at a stated rate of three month libor plus due to our lower profitability level in as compared to and the terms of our agreement with wells fargo 
we are required to comply with various financial and non financial covenants  and we have made various representations and warranties under our agreement with wells fargo 
among the financial covenants is a requirement to maintain a minimum liquidity cash plus excess borrowing base of million 
additional requirements include covenants for minimum capital monthly and minimum net income quarterly 
failure to comply with any of the covenants  representations or warranties could result in our being in default on the loan and could cause all outstanding amounts payable to wells fargo to become immediately due and payable or impact our ability to borrow under the agreement 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  at december   our available borrowing capacity based upon eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory under our revolving line of credit was approximately million 

table of contents our financial plan for indicates that our available cash and cash equivalents  together with cash from operations and borrowings expected to be available under our revolving line of credit  will be sufficient to fund our operations through and into however  our actual results may differ from this plan  and we may be required to consider alternative strategies 
we may be required to raise additional capital in the future 
if necessary  we expect to raise these additional funds through the sale of equity securities or the issuance of new term debt secured by the same assets as the term loans which were fully repaid in there is no guarantee that additional capital will be available from these sources on acceptable terms  if at all  and certain of these sources may require approval by existing lenders 
if we cannot raise the additional funds through these options on acceptable terms or with the necessary timing  management could also reduce discretionary spending to decrease our cash burn rate through actions such as delaying or canceling marketing plans 
these actions would likely extend the then available cash and cash equivalents  and then available borrowings to some degree 
see risk factors in item a of this form k for a discussion of some of the factors that affect our capital raising alternatives 
under the operating agreement  should heska imaging meet certain performance criteria  the imaging minority has been granted a put option to sell us some or all of the imaging minority s remaining position in heska imaging following the audit of our financial statements in  and furthermore  should heska imaging meet certain performance criteria  and the imaging minority fail to exercise an applicable put to sell us all of the imaging minority s position in heska imaging following the audit of our financial statements in  and  we would have a call option to purchase all  but not less than all  of the imaging minority s position in heska imaging 
we believe it is likely that heska imaging will meet the required performance criteria for its highest strike put in in this case  the imaging minority would be granted a put following our audit which could require us to deliver up to million to purchase the of heska imaging we do not own 
if this put is not exercised in full  we would have a call option to purchase all  but not less than all  of the imaging minority s position in heska imaging for million 
in both cases  while we have the right to deliver up to of the consideration in our pubic common stock under certain circumstances  such stock is to be valued based on of market value the delivery stock value and is limited to approximately thousand shares in any case 
if the delivery stock value is less than the market value of our stock at the time of the acquisition  we do not have the right to deliver any public common stock as consideration 
if heska imaging meets the required performance criteria for its highest strike put in  we anticipate that either the imaging minority will exercise its put or we will desire to exercise our call  or perhaps both  following our audit in while our financial plan calls for us to meet this payment obligation using internally generated cash flows  perhaps supplemented by debt financing  there can be no assurance our results will unfold according to our plan 
this potential payment obligation in is an important consideration for us in our cash management decisions 
we would consider acquisitions if we felt they were consistent with our strategic direction 
we paid million in dividends in  and while we may consider paying dividends again in the long term  we do not anticipate the payment of any further dividends for the foreseeable future 
we conducted an odd lot tender offer in which could have led to the repurchase of approximately thousand of our stock if all eligible holders had chosen to participate  and while we may consider stock repurchase alternatives again in the long term  we do not anticipate any stock repurchases in the foreseeable future 

table of contents a summary of our contractual obligations at december  is shown below payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations line of credit operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations in addition to those agreements considered above where our contractual obligation is fixed  we are party to commercial agreements which may require us to make milestone payments under certain circumstances 
any milestone obligations which we believe are likely to be triggered but are not yet paid are included in unconditional purchase obligations in the table above 
we do not believe other potential milestone obligations  some of which we consider to be of remote likelihood of ever being triggered  will have a material impact on our liquidity  capital resources or financial condition in the foreseeable future 
if heska imaging meets the required performance criteria for its highest strike put in  we anticipate that either the imaging minority will exercise its put or we will desire to exercise our call  or perhaps both  following our audit in for further information  please see liquidity  capital resources and financial condition above 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had a net domestic operating loss carryforward  or nol  of approximately million  a domestic alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of approximately thousand and a domestic research and development tax credit carryforward of approximately thousand for federal tax purposes 
our federal nol is expected to expire as follows if unused million in through  million in and and thousand in the nol and tax credit carryforwards are subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by the tax authorities 
in addition  we had a change of ownership as defined under the provisions of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended an ownership change 
we believe the latest ownership change occurred at the time of our initial public offering in july we do not believe this ownership change will place a significant restriction on our ability to utilize our nols in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements management has evaluated recent accounting pronouncements and determined none would have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and foreign interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
interest rate risk at december   there was approximately million outstanding on our line of credit with wells fargo 
we also had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents at december   the majority of which was invested in liquid interest bearing accounts 
we had no interest rate hedge transactions in place on december  we completed an interest rate risk sensitivity analysis based on the above and an assumed one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates 
if market rates increase decrease by one percentage point  we would experience a decrease increase in annual net interest expense of approximately thousand based on our outstanding balances as of december  
table of contents foreign currency risk our investment in foreign assets consists primarily of our investment in our swiss subsidiary 
foreign currency risk may impact our results of operations 
in cases where we purchase inventory in one currency and sell corresponding products in another  our gross margin percentage is typically at risk based on foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  in cases where we may be generating operating income in foreign currencies  the magnitude of such operating income when translated into us dollars will be at risk based on foreign currency exchange rates 
our agreements with suppliers and customers vary significantly in regard to the existence and extent of currency adjustment and other currency risk sharing provisions 
we had no foreign currency hedge transactions in place on december  we have a wholly owned subsidiary in switzerland which uses the swiss franc as its functional currency 
we purchase inventory in foreign currencies  primarily euros and japanese yen  and sell corresponding products in us dollars 
we also sell products in foreign currencies  primarily euros and japanese yen  where our inventory costs are largely in us dollars 
based on our results of operations  if foreign currency exchange rates were to strengthen weaken by against the dollar  we would expect a resulting pre tax loss gain of approximately thousand
