we expect to realize significant operational synergies through the integrated crude oil supply  enhanced optimization of intermediate feedstocks and product distribution costs  improvements in light product yield and reductions in manufacturing costs and stationary source air emissions 
the purchase price is billion  plus the value of inventories at the time of closing 
the inventory value announced in august was estimated at billion 
the purchase and sale agreement provides for a million reduction in the purchase price upon meeting certain conditions as defined in the agreement 
this acquisition  which is subject to customary closing conditions and will require approval from the federal trade commission and the california attorney general  is expected to close before mid the purchase and sale agreement also required an advance payment of million and provides for us to pay a break up fee of up to million in the event that we terminate the agreement except for termination for specified reasons 
in the event a break up fee is required  the advance payment of million will be applied to the amount due 
upon the closing of the carson acquisition  the sellers have agreed  subject to certain limitations  to retain certain obligations  responsibilities  liabilities  costs and expenses arising out of the pre closing operations of the assets 
we have agreed to assume certain obligations  responsibilities  liabilities  costs and expenses arising out of or incurred in connection with decrees  orders and settlements the sellers entered into with governmental and non governmental entities prior to closing 
we expect that upon closing the carson acquisition  we will record certain assumed environmental liabilities 
while these liabilities will likely be significant  we do not believe that they will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we intend to offer tllp the integrated logistics system to be acquired in the carson acquisition in multiple transactions during the first twelve months following the closing of the carson acquisition  with a goal for the first transaction to coincide with the closing of the carson acquisition 
the integrated logistics system includes three marine terminals  four land storage terminals  four product marketing terminals  and over one hundred miles of pipelines including connected access to the los angeles international airport 

table of contents industry overview our profitability is heavily influenced by the cost of crude oil and the aggregate value of the products we make from that crude oil and is affected by changes in economic conditions and supply and demand balance

nationwide unemployment fell to its lowest level in over three years at the end of the nationwide unemployment rate decreased from at the end of to at the end of in california  a key market area for tesoro  the state s unemployment rate fell by  from december to december  to 
lower unemployment and unplanned refinery outages contributed to the improved market conditions on the us west coast 
additionally  emerging markets  primarily in latin america  have provided an export opportunity for diesel and other light products 

table of contents average crude oil prices bbl 
crudeprices

our mid continent and pacific northwest refineries have benefited from processing crude oils from inland us and canada  many of which are priced off west texas intermediate wti crude oil 
this benefit is a result of a significant discount on the price of these crude oils compared to the crude oil processed at our california and mid pacific refineries  many of which are priced off brent crude oil brent 
historically  the price of wti crude oil was comparable to brent  but beginning in wti has priced at a significant discount to brent 
this benefit could decline as various crude oil pipeline and logistics projects are completed  which will allow sweet crude oil from the inland us to be transported to the us gulf coast region 
these projects may result in a narrowing of the price differential of wti priced crude oil relative to brent priced crude oil  which may decrease the margins on refined products for refiners that process wti priced crude oil 
the wti discount to brent remained high throughout  averaging more than per barrel during the year 
we supplied our north dakota refinery exclusively with bakken crude oil in we supplied our washington refinery with a significant amount of price advantaged canadian light sweet crude oil during most of upon completion of the anacortes rail facility in the third quarter of  we also began to supply bakken crude oil to our washington refinery and plan to increase the supply of bakken crude oil to the refinery throughout during  the average discount of bakken crude oil to wti increased to over per barrel  compared to a premium of per barrel during the average discount of canadian light sweet crude oil to wti increased to approximately per barrel during compared to a premium of per barrel during our california refineries ran a significant amount of california heavy crude  including san joaquin valley heavy sjvh  which continued to be priced at a discount to brent throughout during we supplied our alaska refinery primarily with alaska north slope crude oil ans 
the average discount of ans to brent was less than per barrel during 
table of contents product supply and demand factors there are long term factors  in addition to current market conditions  that may impact the supply and demand of refined products in the us including world crude oil prices  increased federal fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles  increased volumes of renewable fuels  mandated by the federal clean air act  various regulations of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary and mobile sources by the us environmental protection agency epa pursuant to the federal clean air act and california statute  potential enactment of federal climate change legislation  and possible promulgation of national regulations relative to gasoline composition and ozone standards under the federal clean air act 

table of contents results of operations a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements in item  together with the following information  are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations  but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance 
income generated by tllp was not material to our consolidated results of operations 
our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze operating segment performance 
to supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  our management uses additional metrics that are known as non gaap financial metrics in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future 
these metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses ebitda 
we define ebitda as earnings loss before depreciation and amortization expense  net interest and financing costs  income taxes and interest income 
we present ebitda because we believe some investors and analysts use ebitda to help analyze our cash flows including our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness and use cash for other purposes  including capital expenditures 
ebitda is also used by some investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance and by management for internal analysis 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to us gaap net income or net cash from operating activities 
ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool  because it excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash from operating activities

environmental and other matters we are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations  including environmental and income tax matters  arising in the ordinary course of business 
although we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters with certainty  we have accrued for the estimated liabilities when appropriate 
we believe that the outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position  although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations 
additionally  if applicable  we accrue receivables for probable third party recoveries 
we are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws  which change frequently  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites  install additional controls  or make other modifications to certain emission sources  equipment or facilities 
future expenditures may be required to comply with the clean air act and other federal  state and local requirements for our various sites  including our refineries  tank farms  pipelines  and currently and previously owned or operated terminal and retail station properties 
the impact of these legislative and regulatory developments  including any greenhouse gas cap and trade program or low carbon fuel standards  could result in increased compliance costs  additional operating restrictions on our business and an increase in the cost of the products we manufacture  which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in  the epa proposed regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act 
the first of these regulations  finalized on april   set standards for the control of greenhouse gas emissions from light trucks and cars 
it could reduce the demand for our manufactured transportation fuels 
in addition  other finalized regulations include permitting requirements for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases above a certain threshold 
the resulting permitting requirements could impose emission controls that increase required capital expenditures at our refineries 
we cannot currently predict its impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in december  the energy independence and security act was enacted into federal law  which created a second renewable fuels standard rfs 
this standard requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels including ethanol and advanced biofuels sold or introduced in the us to reach billion gallons in and to increase to billion gallons by the requirements could reduce future demand growth for petroleum products that we manufacture 
in the near term  the rfs presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for the ethanol  alternative fuel and refining and marketing industries 
we are currently meeting the rfs requirements through a combination of blending renewable fuels obtained from third parties and purchases of renewable identification numbers in the open market that are generated by third parties 
additional expenditures could be required to logistically accommodate the increased use of renewable transportation fuels 
while we cannot currently estimate the ultimate impact of this legislation  and currently believe that the outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position or liquidity  the ultimate outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents in california  assembly bill ab  created a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions and requires that the state return to emission levels by ab focuses on using market mechanisms  such as a cap and trade program and a low carbon fuel standard lcfs to achieve emissions reduction targets

carb has appealed the decision 
on april   the us th circuit court of appeals stayed the lower court s preliminary injunction of carb s enforcement of the standard pending the appeal 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the court s ruling on the lcfs  and the implementation and implications of ab will take many years to realize 
consequently  we cannot currently predict its impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we are subject to extensive federal  state and foreign tax laws and regulations 
newly enacted tax laws and regulations  and changes in existing tax laws and regulations  could result in increased expenditures in the future 
we are also subject to audits by federal  state and foreign taxing authorities in the normal course of business 
it is possible that tax audits could result in claims against us in excess of recorded liabilities 
we believe that resolution of any such claim s would not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months 
environmental liabilities we are incurring and expect to continue to incur expenses for environmental liabilities at a number of currently and previously owned or operated refining  pipeline  terminal and retail station properties 
we have accrued liabilities for these expenses and believe these accruals are adequate based on current information and projections that can be reasonably estimated 
our environmental accruals are based on estimates including engineering assessments  and it is possible that our projections will change  and that additional costs will be recorded as more information becomes available 
at december  and  our accruals for environmental expenditures totaled million and million  respectively 
these accruals include million and million as of december  and  respectively  related to environmental liabilities for site cleanup activities assumed from a prior owner  arising from operations at our martinez refinery prior to august of the million accrued at december   approximately million is subject to a cost share agreement where we are responsible for of the expenditures 
we cannot reasonably determine the full extent of remedial activities that may be required at the martinez refinery 
therefore  it is possible that we will identify additional investigation and remediation costs as more information becomes available

these policies provide coverage up to million for expenditures in excess of million in self insurance  but the insurer has challenged coverage and filed a declaratory relief action in federal court 
we have not recognized possible insurance recoveries related to this matter

the investigation was driven by an order received in from the san francisco bay regional water quality control board 
the order named us as well as two previous owners of the martinez refinery 
we cannot currently estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of the order  but we believe it will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity

key provisions of the act require that standardized swaps be cleared through a registered clearinghouse and executed on a registered trading platform with specific margin requirements 
these requirements could make these products more complicated or costly by creating new regulatory risks and increasing reporting  capital  and administrative requirements for companies that use derivatives for hedging and trading activities

long term commitments contractual commitments we have numerous contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our refineries  debt service and leases see notes m and q to our consolidated financial statements in item 
we also have minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects 
the contractual commitments detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to tllp under our various fee based commercial agreements as these related party transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes our annual contractual commitments as of december  in millions contractual obligation total thereafter long term debt obligations a capital lease obligations b operating lease obligations b crude oil supply obligations c other purchase obligations d capital expenditure obligations e total contractual obligations a includes maturities of principal and interest payments  excluding capital lease obligations 
amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings 
b capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest 
operating lease obligations primarily represent our future minimum noncancellable lease commitments 
operating lease obligations primarily include lease arrangements with initial or remaining noncancellable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 
c represents an estimate of our short term and long term contractual purchase commitments for crude oil  with remaining terms ranging from three months to seven years 
prices under these term agreements fluctuate due to market responsive pricing provisions 
to estimate our annual commitments under these contracts  we estimated crude oil prices using actual market prices by crude oil type as of december   with prices ranging from per barrel to per barrel  and volumes based on the contract s minimum purchase requirements 
we also purchase additional crude oil under short term renewable contracts and in the spot market  which is not included in the table above 
d represents primarily long term commitments for the transportation of crude oil and refined products as well as to purchase industrial gases  chemical processing services and utilities at our refineries 
these purchase obligations are based on the contract s minimum volume requirements 
e minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects 
we also have other noncurrent liabilities pertaining to our defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits  environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations 
with the exception of amounts classified as current there is uncertainty as to the timing of future cash flows related to these obligations 
as such  we have excluded the future cash flows from the contractual commitments table above 
see additional information on pension and other postretirement benefits  environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations in note p  note q and note n  respectively  to our consolidated financial statements in item 
table of contents in addition  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows with our unrecognized tax benefits  with the exception of amounts classified as current  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement 
accordingly  we have excluded from the table million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
related to these unrecognized tax benefits  we have also recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of million at december  see note o to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information 
pension funding we provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan for all eligible employees  with benefits based on years of service and compensation 
our long term expected return on plan assets is as of december   and the return on our funded employee pension plan assets was million in and million in based on a discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of december   the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately of the projected benefit obligation 
on july   the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map was signed into law which  includes provisions for pension funding relief for plan sponsors by stabilizing the interest rates plan sponsors use to determine their pension funding requirements 
previous funding rules required using a discount rate based on a two year average of high quality corporate bond rates to determine pension liabilities and minimum contributions 
the new legislation also stipulates that the discount rate falls within a corridor of a year average corporate bond rate 
the corridor will grow per year 
the provisions of map are effective for plan years beginning on or after january  on this new map basis  at january  the adjusted funding target attainment percentage a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations was 
tesoro contributed million during  a portion of which was in excess of the minimum required 
future contributions are affected by returns on plan assets  discount rates  employee demographics  regulatory environments and other factors
