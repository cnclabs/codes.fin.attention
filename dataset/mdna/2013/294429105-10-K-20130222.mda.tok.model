we used the net proceeds of the sale of the notes to finance the acquisition of csc credit services in december debt covenants 
our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including  for example  limits on secured debt and sale leaseback transactions 
in addition  our senior credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than to  and limit the amount of subsidiary debt 
our leverage ratio was at december  none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and  as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt  however  our senior notes  discussed above  contain change in control provisions 
if we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard poor s  or s p  and moody s investors service  or moody s  below an investment grade rating within days of such change of control or notice thereof  then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
credit ratings 
credit ratings reflect an independent agency s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity 
the ratings reflect many considerations  such as the nature of the borrower s industry and its competitive position  the size of the company  its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company s cash flows to changes in the economy 
the two largest rating agencies  s p and moody s  use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings 
the highest quality rating for long term credit obligations is aaa and aaa for s p and moody s  respectively 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 
long term ratings of bbb and baa or better by s p and moody s  respectively  reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade 
at december   the long term ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa  which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december  a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities  and could limit  or in the case of a significant downgrade  preclude our ability to issue cp 
if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels  we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt 
in addition  the market s demand for  and thus our ability to readily issue  new debt could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment

some of the excluded commitments are discussed below the footnotes to the table 
payments due by total less than year to years to years thereafter in millions debt including capitalized lease obligation  operating leases data processing  outsourcing agreements and other purchase obligations other long term liabilities interest payments the amounts are gross of unamortized discounts totaling million and fair value adjustments of million at december  total debt on our consolidated balance sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustments 
our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment  which include the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in these agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions  and certain administrative functions 
these agreements expire between and these long term liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension  postretirement and other compensation related plans  some of which are discounted in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments 
in the table above  we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations  as such required funding amounts beyond have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance 
for future interest payments on variable rate debt  which are generally based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor or on cp rates for investment grade issuers  we used the variable rate in effect at december  to calculate these payments 
our variable rate debt at december   consisted of cp  borrowings under our credit facilities and our five year senior notes due against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates 
future interest payments related to our senior credit facility and our cp program are based on the borrowings outstanding at december  through their respective maturity dates  assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time 
the variable portion of the rate at december  ranged from to for all of our variable rate debt 
future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates 
this table excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
off balance sheet transactions we do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 
pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds  we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of million and million  as of december  and  respectively  to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development 
the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds 
these fixed assets are still recognized on the company s consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company 
letters of credit and guarantees we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit  performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business 
the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december   and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less 
guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units 
the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december  benefit plans we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan  or usrip that covers approximately of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june   the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december  this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status 
we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan  or crip 
the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan in at december   the usrip met or exceeded erisa s minimum funding requirements 
during the twelve months ended december   we did not make any contributions to the usrip 
during the year ended december   we made contributions of million to the usrip 
we also contributed million and million to the crip during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
in the future  we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions  depending on certain circumstances  including market conditions and liquidity needs 
we believe additional funding contributions  if any  would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs  which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities  available cash and cash equivalents  and our credit facilities 
for our non us  tax qualified retirement plans  we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations 
for the non qualified supplementary retirement plans  we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants  but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap 
for additional information about our benefit plans  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
seasonality we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams 
revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year 
revenue from our ocis and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions  most commonly the second and third calendar quarters 
revenues in our north america commercial business and the consumer financial marketing services business line within uscis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of project based agreements 
on a consolidated basis  combining all of these businesses  and assuming normal economic conditions  first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year  and the fourth quarter is the highest 
effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates equifax s operating results are not materially affected by inflation  although inflation may result in increases in the company s expenses  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and profitability 
a portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of us dollar net assets  revenues and expenses 
potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored 
we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates  although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 
recent accounting pronouncements for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results 
for additional information about these policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured  the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis  in which case revenue is recognized  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  when the services are provided 
a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscription based contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period  generally one year 
revenue related to subscription based contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided  using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed 
any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contract s subscription period 
revenue related to subscription based contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term 
revenue is recorded net of sales taxes 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if there is uncertainty as to the customer s acceptance of our deliverables  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past 
we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates  revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained 
also within our workforce solutions operating segment  the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients 
revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones  upon calculation of the credit  or when the credit is utilized by our client  depending on the provisions of the client contract 
we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements 
the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information  file updates for certain solutions  services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel  training services  statistical models and other services 
to account for each of these elements separately  the delivered elements must have stand alone value to our customer 
if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting  we apply one of the accounting policies described above 
this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract 
many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments 
no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or  in most cases  purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement 
some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases 
these development services do not meet the requirement for having stand alone value  thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service 
revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract 
we have some multiple element arrangements that include software 
we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery  in accordance with the applicable guidance 
we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 
deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having stand alone value discussed above 
deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
judgments and uncertainties each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables 
these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value  concluding when the element will be delivered  evaluating collectibility  and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services 
in addition  the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates  principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears 
in these instances  we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past 
differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported 
effects if actual results differ from assumptions we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past 
we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates  revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future  we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance or trends  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
we have ten reporting units comprised of consumer information solutions which includes part of online consumer information solutions  mortgage solutions and consumer financial marketing services  identity management part of online consumer information solutions  europe  latin america  canada consumer  north america personal solutions  north america commercial solutions  verification services  tax management services part of employer services and talent management services part of employer services 
the goodwill balance at december   for our ten reporting units was as follows december  in millions consumer information solutions id management europe latin america canada consumer north america personal solutions north america commercial solutions verification services tax management services talent management services total goodwill  in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment the revised standard 
the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we performed the qualitative assessment for our consumer information solutions  latin america  europe  canada consumer  north america personal solutions  and north america commercial solutions reporting units 
in this qualitative assessment  we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  overall financial performance and other entity specific events 
in addition  for each of these reporting units  the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that significantly exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units 
based on these assessments  we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not 
as a result of our conclusions  no further testing was required for these reporting units 
judgments and uncertainties in determining the fair value of our reporting units for which we performed a quantitative test  we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting unit s business enterprise value 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and long term revenue growth rates  operating margins for each reporting unit  discount rates  foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges 
the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization  for benchmark companies 
we believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks  participate in similar markets  provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly 
the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our competition discussion in item of our annual report on form k 
data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information 
id management has benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type  such as experian group limited and fair isaac corporation 
verification services  tax management services and talent management services share a different set of benchmark companies  notably adp and paychex inc  as the markets they serve are different than those served by our other reporting units 
valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting unit s operating result with the comparable companies information 
in addition to these financial considerations  qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple 
the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting unit s fair value 
we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units 
this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach  with of the value coming from the income approach 
we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations 
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value 
judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 
we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test 
growth assumptions the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance  the details of which are described in our management s discussion and analysis of operating performance 
additionally  we consider the impact that known economic  industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts  as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives  client service and retention standards  and cost management programs 
at the end of the forecast period  the long term growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was generally to based on management s assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit  as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp  inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve 
we projected revenue growth in for our reporting units in completing our impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units  such as demand for employment verification services and government hiring activity at the us transportation and security administration in verification services and talent management services reporting units and not based on the assumption of meaningful economic recovery 
growth in the talent management services reporting unit is also based on growth in the commercial sector of that business 
the anticipated revenue growth in all of the reporting units  however  is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth 
our long term forecast is not dependent upon meaningful recovery of the global economy in the near term and we continue to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units 
discount rate assumptions we utilize a weighted average cost of capital  or wacc  in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit 
we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed 
to calculate the wacc  the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures 
the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the risk free interest rate  beta  equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit 
the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the company s tax rate 
for the annual goodwill impairment evaluation  the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units evaluated ranged from to 
because of assigned market premiums  discount rates are lowest for reporting units  whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve  their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors 
where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to competition  the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit 
estimated fair value and sensitivities the estimated fair value of the reporting units whose fair value was calculated for purposes of the impairment testing is derived from the valuation techniques described above  incorporating the related projections and assumptions 
an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity 
the estimated fair value for all reporting units exceeded the carrying value of these units as of september  as a result  no goodwill impairment was recorded 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions  therefore  in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value 
for example  an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value 
we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values 
ultimately  future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value 
the excess of fair value over carrying value for the company s reporting units that were valued as of september   ranged from approximately to 
the reporting unit having the lowest absolute dollar excess of fair value over carrying value is our talent management services business which has a goodwill balance of million as of september  this reporting unit has been impacted by uncertainty in government hiring activity 
while no impairment was noted in our impairment test as of september   if customer hiring activity does not increase in the near to medium term as forecasted  projected revenue growth for commercial customers does not materialize or if other events adversely impact the business drivers and corresponding assumptions used to value this reporting unit  there could be a change in the valuation of our goodwill in future periods and would likely result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
additionally  an increase in the discount rate due to outside factors or a decrease in the market multiples would likely result in an impairment 
no new indications of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of  thus no impairment testing was updated as of december  effect if actual results differ from assumptions we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
loss contingencies we are subject to various proceedings  lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business 
we determine whether to disclose and or accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable  reasonably possible or remote 
judgments and uncertainties we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated settlement costs 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible  but not probable  we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency 
our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies 
however  if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates  we may be exposed to a loss that could be material 
income taxes we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid 
we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable 
our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities 
we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations 
we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals 
judgments and uncertainties we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income  mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions  and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and  if so  the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements 
we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances  such as changes in tax law  interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law 
these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense 
settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash 
at december   million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of which it is reasonably possible that up to million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material 
pension and other postretirement plans we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest cost and mortality and retirement rates 
actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost 
judgments and uncertainties we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  in each case as it relates to our us pension plan 
our canadian plan is small  and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material 
we determine our discount rates primarily based on high quality  fixed income investments and yield to maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date 
discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions 
we use a third party yield curve to develop our discount rates 
the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated high quality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period  from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class  as provided by our external investment advisor 
in  the us pension plan investment returns of exceeded the expected return of for the third time in the last four years 
however  due to lower forecasted future returns the expected return for was reduced to 
the crip earned in also exceeding its expected return of for the third time in four years 
the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities 
our weighted average expected rate of return for is as compared to which was the expected rate 
annual differences  if any  between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss  a component of other comprehensive income 
in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss  we use a market related value of assets that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years 
the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive 
the market related value of our assets was million at december  we do not expect our net periodic benefit cost  which includes the effect of the market related value of assets  to be materially different than our cost  excluding the pension settlement and curtailment recorded in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations 
adjusting our weighted average expected long term rate of return at december  by basis points would change our estimated pension expense in by approximately million 
adjusting our weighted average discount rate at december  by basis points would change our estimated pension expense in by approximately million 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material 
purchase accounting for acquisitions we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification  business combinations  which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis 
in general  the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition 
we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs 
any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets 
transaction costs  as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies  are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income 
judgments and uncertainties we consider accounting for business combinations critical because management judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets  which can materially affect the our results of operations 
on december   we acquired csc credit services recorded total assets of billion as of the acquisition date 
the assets we acquired included a material amount of intangible assets that were subject to the significant estimates described above 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to this acquisition 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities  and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to hedge certain of these exposures 
we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital expenditure activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do transact business in other currencies  primarily the british pound  the canadian dollar  the chilean peso  the argentine peso and the euro 
for most of these foreign currencies  we are a net recipient  and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
we are required to translate  or express in us dollars  the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated or measured in foreign currencies at the applicable year end rate of exchange on our consolidated balance sheets and income statement items of our foreign subsidiaries at the average rates prevailing during the year 
we record the resulting translation adjustment  and gains and losses resulting from the translation of intercompany balances of a long term investment nature within other comprehensive income  as a component of our shareholders equity 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses  which have historically been immaterial  are recorded on our consolidated statements of income 
we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates  although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency 
for the year ended december   a weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during would have increased our revenue by million and our pre tax operating profit by million 
for the year ended december   a weaker us dollar against the currencies of all foreign countries in which we had operations during would have increased our revenue by million and our pre tax operating profit by million 
a stronger us dollar would have resulted in similar decreases to our revenue and pre tax operating profit for and interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our variable rate  long term senior credit facility and commercial paper borrowings  as well as our interest rate swaps which economically convert our fixed rate bonds from a fixed rate of interest to a floating rate 
we attempt to achieve the lowest all in weighted average cost of debt while simultaneously taking into account the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt  and the average life and scheduled maturities of our debt 
at december   our weighted average cost of debt was and weighted average life of debt was years 
at december   of our debt was fixed rate  and the remaining was variable rate after giving effect to the interest rate swaps on our bonds 
occasionally we use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps 
a basis point increase in the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt would have increased our interest expense by million 
based on the amount of outstanding variable rate debt  we have material exposure to interest rate risk 
in the future  if our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt were to change due to additional borrowings under existing or new variable rate debt  we could have additional exposure to interest rate risk 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt  as well as the proportionate amount of fixed rate and variable rate debt  can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors
