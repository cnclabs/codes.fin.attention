item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we generate our revenues primarily from sales of admission to our parks  food  merchandise and games inside our parks  and hotel rooms  food and other attractions outside our parks 
our principal costs and expenses  which include salaries and wages  advertising  maintenance  operating supplies  utilities and insurance  are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance 
each of our properties is run by a park general manager and operates autonomously 
management reviews operating results  evaluates performance and makes operating decisions  including the allocation of resources  on a property by property basis 
discrete financial information and operating results are prepared at the individual park level for use by the ceo  who is the chief operating decision maker codm  as well as by the chief financial officer  the chief operating officer  the executive vice president  operations  and the park general managers

these principles require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions during the normal course of business that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results or involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
application of the critical accounting policies described below involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
expenditures made to maintain such assets in their original operating condition are expensed as incurred  and improvements and upgrades are capitalized 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the composite method is used for the group of assets acquired as a whole in  as well as for the groups of like assets of each subsequent business acquisition 
the unit method is used for all individual assets purchased 
upon the normal retirement of an asset within a composite group  our practice generally had been to extend the depreciable life of that composite group beyond its original estimated useful life 
in conjunction with the preparation of our financial statements for the three months ended july   management determined that this methodology was not appropriate 
as a result  we revised the useful lives of our composite groups to their original estimated useful life ascribed upon acquisition and corrected previously computed depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 
we evaluated the amount and nature of these adjustments and concluded that they were not material to either our prior annual or quarterly financial statements 
nonetheless  the historical financial statement amounts included in this filing have been updated for this corrected estimate 
as part of a routine review by the division of corporation finance of the sec of the partnership form k for the year ended december   the partnership received staff comments on december  and january  the partnership is responding to the staff comments received on january  that requests information related to our use of the composite method of depreciation for acquired assets 
the 
table of contents partnership has determined that it is preferable to change from the composite method of depreciation to the unit method of depreciation with the change expected to be effective january  the partnership believes that pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles  changing from the composite method of depreciation to the unit method of depreciation is a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle  which should be accounted for prospectively 
this prospective application will result in the discontinuance of the composite method of depreciation for all prior acquisitions with the existing net book value of each composite pool allocated to the remaining individual assets units in that pool with each unit assigned an appropriate remaining useful life on an individual unit basis 
once under the unit method of depreciation  all gains or losses on prospective asset retirements will result in an adjustment to earnings rather than to accumulated depreciation which is the case for normal retirements under the composite method of depreciation 
we are in the process of determining the impact of this change 
based on our analysis to date  we do not believe such a change will have a material effect on our financial position or liquidity in future periods  but it is possible that future asset retirements could have a material impact on earnings in the periods such items occur 
impairment of long lived assets the carrying values of long lived assets  including property and equipment  are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets  including disposition  are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets 
fair value is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
in order to determine if an asset has been impaired  assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable  independent cash flows are available 
the determination of both undiscounted and discounted cash flows requires management to make significant estimates and consider an anticipated course of action as of the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether impairment exists  the amount of the impairment charge recorded and whether the effects could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
at the end of the third quarter of  the partnership concluded based on operating results through the third quarter and updated forecasts  that a review of the carrying value of operating long lived assets at wildwater kingdom was warranted 
after performing its review  the partnership determined that a portion of the park fixed assets were impaired 
also  at the end of the third quarter of  the partnership concluded that market conditions had changed on the adjacent non operating land of wildwater kingdom 
after performing its review of the updated market value of the land  the partnership determined the land was impaired 
the partnership recognized a total of million of fixed asset impairment for operating and non operating assets during the third quarter of there was no impairment of long lived assets in goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  including trade names  are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in equity price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  which is estimated using both an income discounted cash flow and market approach 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
goodwill and trade names have been assigned at the reporting unit  or park level  for purposes of impairment testing 
until december  goodwill related to parks acquired prior to was tested annually for impairment as of october  while goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles  including trade name intangibles  related to the ppi acquisition in were tested annually for impairment as of april effective in december  we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment tests from april and october to december to more closely align the impairment testing procedures with our long range planning and forecasting process  which occurs in the fourth quarter each year 
we believe the change is preferable since the long term cash flow projections are a key component in performing our annual impairment tests of goodwill 
in addition  we changed the date of our annual impairment test for other indefinite lived intangibles from april to december for both and  we completed the review of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles as of december  and december   respectively  and determined the goodwill was not impaired at either balance sheet date 
the change in accounting principle related to changing the annual goodwill impairment testing date did not delay  accelerate  avoid or cause an impairment charge 
as it was impracticable to objectively determine operating and valuation estimates for periods prior to december   we have prospectively applied the change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date from december  
table of contents it is possible that our assumptions about future performance  as well as the economic outlook and related conclusions regarding the valuation of our reporting units parks  could change adversely  which may result in additional impairment that would have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
at december   all reporting units with goodwill had fair values in excess of their carrying values by greater than 
self insurance reserves reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance 
reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable 
reserves for identified claims are based upon our own historical claims experience and third party estimates of settlement costs 
reserves for ibnr claims  which are not material to our consolidated financial statements  are based upon our own claims data history  as well as industry averages 
all reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary 
derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are only used within our overall risk management program to manage certain interest rate and foreign currency risks from time to time 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
derivative financial instruments used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the related underlying exposures 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify as effective hedging activities are reported as net effect of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  the accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to interest rate swaps that become ineffective is amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap  and reported as a component of net effect of swaps in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition revenues on multi day admission tickets are recognized over the estimated number of visits expected for each type of ticket  and are adjusted periodically during the season 
all other revenues are recognized on a daily basis based on actual guest spending at our facilities  or over the park operating season in the case of certain marina revenues and certain sponsorship revenues 
revenues on admission tickets for the next operating season  including season passes  are deferred in the year received and recognized as revenue in the following operating season 
admission revenues include amounts paid to gain admission into our parks  including parking fees 
revenues related to extra charge attractions  including our premium benefit offerings  are included in accommodations and other revenue 
income taxes the partnership legal structure includes both partnerships and corporate subsidiaries 
as a publicly traded partnership  the partnership is subject to an entity level tax the ptp tax 
accordingly  the partnership itself is not subject to corporate income taxes  rather  the partnership tax attributes except those of the corporate subsidiaries are included in the tax returns of its partners 
the partnership corporate subsidiaries are subject to entity level income taxes 
the partnership provision for taxes includes both the ptp tax and the income taxes from the corporate subsidiaries 
the partnership corporate subsidiaries account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future book and tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rate expected to apply in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the partnership records a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
through december   the partnership had recorded a million valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset for foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the need for this allowance was based on several factors including the accumulated federal net operating loss carryforward  the ten year carryforward period allowed for excess foreign tax credits  experience to date of foreign tax credit limitations  and management long term estimates of domestic and foreign source income 
during  we claimed and received refunds of million for foreign taxes paid in previous years 
the recovery of prior year taxes resulted in a redetermination of the foreign tax credit carryforwards and a million reduction in the valuation allowance related to these carryforwards 
also during  we continued to utilize the federal tax net operating loss carryforward and updated our long term estimates of domestic and foreign source income 
based on these updated estimates  we believe no additional adjustments to the valuation allowance was warranted 
the total valuation allowance reduction results in a million tax benefit in as of december   we had million of deferred tax assets associated with the foreign tax credit carryforwards and an million related valuation allowance 
there is inherent uncertainty in the estimates used to project the amount of foreign tax credit carryforwards that are more likely than not to be realized 
it is possible that our future income projections  as well as the economic outlook and related conclusions regarding the valuation 
table of contents allowance could change  which may result in additional valuation allowance being recorded or may result in additional valuation allowance reductions  which may have a material negative or positive effect on our reported financial position and results of operations in future periods

the following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended december  and amounts in thousands  except per capita spending and percentages increase decrease net revenues operating costs and expenses depreciation and amortization loss on impairment retirement of fixed assets n m gain on sale of other assets n m operating income other data adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin attendance per capita spending out of park revenues n m not meaningful for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda  including how we define and use adjusted ebitda  as well as a reconciliation from net income  see item  selected financial data  on pages consolidated net revenues totaled  million in  increasing million  from  million in the increase in revenues reflects a  or  increase in average in park guest per capita spending compared with a year ago and a less than  or million visit  decrease in attendance 
in park guest per capita spending represents the amount spent per attendee to gain admission to a park  plus all amounts spent while inside the park gates 
the increase in per capita spending was primarily due to new premium benefit offerings and the positive impact of new customer messaging and dynamic pricing 
the slight decrease in attendance for compared to was largely due to less than favorable weather that the parks experienced during the fourth quarter of despite the slight decrease in overall attendance  the parks experienced growth in the number of season passes sold  as well as season pass visits  which was a focus of management heading into the season 
the growth in season pass visits was the result of an increased marketing focus toward season passes at several of our parks  resulting in a record number of season passes sold in the increase in revenues was somewhat offset by a decrease of less than  or approximately million  in out of park revenues  which represents the sale of hotel rooms  food  merchandise and other complementary activities located outside of the park gates 
the decrease in out of park revenues was primarily driven by softness in our overall hotel properties performance in the increase in revenues for the fiscal year also reflects the negative impact of currency exchange rates and the weakening us dollar on our canadian operations approximately million during operating costs and expenses increased million  or  to million versus million for and were in line with expectations 
the increase in costs and expenses was the result of a million increase in cost of goods sold  a million increase in operating expenses  offset somewhat by a decrease in selling  general and administrative costs 
the increase in cost of goods sold is consistent with anticipated cost increases associated with our efforts to improve the quality of food and other product offerings at the parks in operating expenses increased due to several factors  including higher employment related costs  higher operating supply costs  and higher self insurance expenses 
employment related costs increased approximately million due to normal merit increases  increases in health related benefit costs  additional staffing levels associated with new premium benefit offerings and other initiatives aimed at improving the overall guest experience  and non recurring severance payments 
operating supplies and expenses increased approximately million due primarily to initiatives to expand or enhance live entertainment at the parks  as well as incremental costs associated with our new e commerce platform 
during the year  public liability and workers compensation expense increased million due to claim settlements and an increase in our reserves based on management estimates of future claims 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative costs was due to a decrease in employment related costs million and professional and administrative costs million  offset by an increase in operating supplies million and advertising fees million 
the decrease in employment costs was primarily due to a decrease in costs associated with a legal accrual made 
table of contents in  offset somewhat by higher wages and benefits due to normal merit increases and additional staffing 
professional and administrative fees decreased primarily due to a reduction in litigation expenses and costs for sec compliance matters related to special meeting requests in the operating supplies and advertising increases were due to incremental costs to support operating initiatives including general infrastructure improvements 
the overall increase in costs and expenses also reflects the positive impact of exchange rates on our canadian operations million during the loss on impairment retirement of fixed assets  net  during totaled million  reflects a non cash charge of million for the partial impairment of operating and non operating assets at wildwater kingdom along with losses on other retirements in the normal course of business

after depreciation and amortization  as well as impairment charges and all other non cash costs  operating income for decreased million to million from million in interest expense for the year decreased million to million from million in the reduction in interest expense was primarily attributable to an approximate basis point bps decline in our effective interest rate  the result of lower fixed rates on london interbank offered rate libor within our interest rate swap contracts 
the average fixed libor rate in our swap agreements declined from in to in additionally during  million of term debt principal payments were made  reducing our average debt outstanding 
during  the net effect of our swaps was recorded as a benefit to earnings of million compared to a benefit to earnings of million in the difference reflects the regularly scheduled amortization of amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci related to the swaps  which were offset by gains from marking the ineffective and de designated swaps to market and foreign currency gains related to the us dollar denominated canadian term loan in the current period 
during  we also recognized a million net benefit to earnings for unrealized realized foreign currency gains  which included a million unrealized foreign currency gain on the us dollar denominated debt held at our canadian property 
a provision for taxes of million was recorded in  consisting of a provision for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries of million and a provision for publicly traded partnership ptp taxes of million

in park guest per capita spending represents the amount spent per attendee to gain admission to a park  plus all amounts spent while inside the park gates 
the improved attendance for compared to was largely due to increases in season passes sold and season pass visits 
the growth in season pass visits was the result of an increased marketing focus toward season passes at several of our parks  resulting in a significant increase in the number of season passes sold 
the increase in revenues also reflects an increase of  or approximately million  in out of park revenues  which represents the sale of hotel rooms  food  merchandise and other complementary activities located outside of the park gates 
the increase in out of park revenues was primarily driven by an increase in occupancy and average daily room rates at most of our hotel properties 
the increase in revenues for the fiscal year also reflects the impact of currency exchange rates and the weakening us dollar on our canadian operations approximately million during operating costs and expenses increased million  or  to million versus million for and were in line with expectations 
the increase in costs and expenses was the result of a million increase in cost of goods sold  a million increase in operating expenses  and a increase in selling  general and administrative costs 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to higher wages of million  million of higher maintenance costs and million of higher operating supply costs 
the cost of operating supplies trended up primarily as a result of higher attendance 
the increase in wages was largely due to increased seasonal labor hours as a result of expanded operating hours at several parks  additional attractions and guest services  and the overall effect of increased attendance 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs reflects the impact of million of non recurring costs incurred in  including litigation expenses and costs for sec compliance matters related to special meeting requests  as well as costs associated with the relocation of a future ride and costs associated with the transition to a new advertising agency 
additionally  selling  general and administrative costs increased due to an increase in costs associated with our long term executive compensation plans resulting in large part from the increase in the market price of our units during the period

this compares to a non cash charge of million at great america for the partial impairment of its fixed assets and a million charge for asset retirements across all properties 
additionally  non cash charges of million and million were recorded during the second and fourth quarters of  respectively  for the partial impairment of trade names originally recorded at the time of the ppi acquisition 
although the acquisition of the ppi parks continues to meet our collective operating and profitability goals  the performance of certain acquired parks fell below our original expectations in  which when coupled with a higher cost of capital  resulted in the impairment charges recorded in it is important to 
table of contents note that each of the acquired ppi parks produces positive cash flow  and that trade name write downs and fixed asset impairment losses do not affect cash  adjusted ebitda or liquidity

additionally  interest expense increased due to higher average interest rates as a result of refinancing a portion of term debt with the bond indenture in july this increase in rates was slightly offset by a decline in rates on our derivative portfolio during the fourth quarter of  as billion of derivatives matured and were replaced by derivatives with lower effective interest rates 
also  as the result of the july refinancing  a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt was recognized and recorded in the statement of operations for during  the net effect of our swaps increased million to a non cash benefit to earnings of million  reflecting gains from marking the ineffective and de designated swaps to market  offset somewhat by the regularly scheduled amortization of amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci related to the swaps and foreign currency losses related to the us dollar denominated canadian term loan in the current period

financial condition with respect to both liquidity and cash flow  we ended in sound condition 
the working capital ratio current assets divided by current liabilities of at december  was the result of our highly seasonal business 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities  capital expenditures  partnership distributions  and pre opening expenses as required 
operating activities net cash from operating activities in increased million to million from million in the increase in operating cash flows between years was primarily attributable to the increase in the operating results of our parks in over and deferred taxes  somewhat offset by a negative change in working capital 
net cash from operating activities in increased million to million from million in the increase in operating cash flows between years was primarily attributable to the increase in the operating results of our parks in and the positive change in working capital

total cash spent on capital expenditures was million in including the effect of the two asset sales  net cash used for investing activities in totaled million  compared to million in and million in the capital expenditures plan was larger than the prior year 
the change between and was due to the timing of capital expenditures for rides being placed into service for the season 
historically  we have been able to improve our revenues and profitability by continuing to make substantial capital investments in our park and resort facilities 
this has enabled us to maintain or increase attendance levels  as well as to generate increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations 
for the operating season  we will be investing approximately of net revenues in marketable capital investments across our properties  with the highlight of the program being the addition of gatekeeper  a foot tall winged steel coaster  at cedar point 
in addition to gatekeeper  the tallest and fastest wooden coaster in northern california  called gold stryker  will be making its debut at california great america 

table of contents in addition to these new thrill rides  we are also investing in other capital improvements across our parks  including the introduction of new dinosaur attractions at carowinds  valleyfair and worlds of fun 
additionally  we will be combining worlds of fun and oceans of fun into a single admission ticket  while significantly upgrading the water park attractions at oceans of fun 
finally  we will also be enhancing entertainment offerings and continuing our infrastructure upgrades across our properties

net cash utilized for financing activities in  which reflected the february refinancing of our debt  decreased million compared with an increase in distribution payments in million vs 
million in was somewhat offset by an increase in cash from operating activities 
liquidity and capital resources in july  we issued million of senior unsecured notes the notes in a private placement  including million of original issue discount to yield 
the notes mature in concurrently with this offering  we entered into a new  million credit agreement the credit agreement  which includes a  million senior secured term loan facility and a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
the net proceeds from the offering of the notes  along with borrowings under the credit agreement  were used to repay in full all amounts outstanding under our previous credit facilities 
on february   we amended the credit agreement as so amended  the amended credit agreement and extended the maturity date of the us term loan portion of the credit facilities by one year 
certain terms of the amendment are described below 
terms of the credit agreement include a million revolving credit facility 
under the agreement  the canadian portion of the revolving credit facility has a limit of million 
us denominated loans made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate of libor plus bps with no libor floor 
canadian denominated loans made under the canadian portion of the facility also bear interest at a rate of libor plus bps with no libor floor 
the revolving credit facility  which matures in july  also provides for the issuance of documentary and standby letters of credit 
the extended us term loan  as amended on february   amortizes at million per year and matures in december in may  the partnership prepaid million of long term debt to meet its obligation under the excess cash flow ecf provision of the credit agreement 
as a result of this prepayment  as well as additional optional long term debt prepayments made in august and september of million and million  respectively  the partnership has no scheduled term debt principal payments until the first quarter of the extended us term loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus bps  with a libor floor of bps 
until our amendment to the credit agreement  the us term loan bore interest at a rate of libor plus bps  with a libor floor of bps 
at december   we had  million of variable rate term debt  million of the fixed rate notes  and no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
after letters of credit  which totaled million at december   we had million of available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
of our total term debt outstanding at the end of the year  none is scheduled to mature within the next twelve months 
our million face value of notes require semi annual interest payments in february and august  with the principal due in full on august  the notes may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at any time prior to august  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus a make whole premium together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date 
thereafter  the notes may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at various prices depending on the date redeemed 
prior to august   up to of the notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at 
in  we entered into several fixed rate interest rate swap agreements totaling billion 
the weighted average fixed libor rate on those interest rate swaps  which matured in october  was 
based upon our scheduled quarterly regression analysis testing for the effectiveness of the accounting treatment of these swaps  as well as changes in the forward interest rate yield curves used in that testing  the swaps were deemed to be ineffective beginning in october and continued through their maturity 
this resulted in the swaps not qualifying for hedge accounting during the fourth quarter of through october of in  we entered into two cross currency swap agreements  which matured in february and effectively converted million of term debt at the time  and the associated interest payments  from us dollar denominated debt at a rate of libor plus bps to fixed rate canadian dollar denominated debt 
as a result of paying down the underlying canadian term debt with net proceeds from the sale of surplus land near canada s wonderland in august  the notional amounts of the underlying debt and the cross currency swaps no longer matched 
because of the mismatch of the notional amounts  we determined the swaps would no longer be highly effective going forward  resulting in the de designation of the swaps as of the end of august based on the change in currency exchange rates from the time we originally entered into the cross currency swap agreements in  the termination liability of the swaps has increased steadily over time 
in order to minimize further downside risk to the swaps termination value  in may we entered into several foreign currency swap agreements to fix the exchange rate on of the liability 
in july  we fixed the exchange rate on another of the swap liability  leaving only exposed to further fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
based on currency exchange rates in place at the termination date and the exchange rates contracted in the foreign currency swap agreements  the cash termination costs of the cross currency swaps totaled million on february  
table of contents in addition to the above mentioned covenants and provisions  the amended credit agreement contains an initial three year requirement that at least of our aggregate term debt and senior notes be subject to either a fixed interest rate or interest rate protection 
as of december   we were in compliance with this requirement as discussed below 
in order to maintain fixed interest costs on a portion of our domestic term debt beyond the expiration of the swaps that matured in october  in september we entered into several forward starting swap agreements that effectively convert a total of million of libor based variable rate debt to fixed rates beginning in october the weighted average fixed rate on these libor based interest rate swaps  which mature in december  is 
in order to monetize the difference in the libor floors  in march we entered into several additional forward starting basis rate swap agreements march swaps that  when combined with the september swaps  effectively convert million of variable rate debt to fixed rates beginning in october the september swaps and the march swaps  which have been jointly designated as cash flow hedges  mature in december and fix libor at a weighted average rate of 
on may   we entered into four additional forward starting interest rate swap agreements may forward starting swaps that effectively convert another million of variable rate debt to fixed rates beginning in october these swaps  which have been designated as cash flow hedges  mature in december and fix libor at a weighted average rate of 
the fair market value of all million of forward starting swap agreements at december  was a liability of million  which was recorded in derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
the following table presents our september swaps  march swaps  and may forward starting swaps  which became effective october  and mature december   along with their notional amounts and their effective fixed interest rates 
s in thousands forward starting interest rate swaps notional amounts libor rate total s average rate the amended credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios  which if breached for any reason  including a decline in operating results due to economic or weather conditions  could result in an event of default under the agreement 
the most critical of these ratios is the consolidated leverage ratio 
at the end of  this ratio was set at x consolidated total debt excluding the revolving debt to consolidated ebitda 
as of december   our consolidated total debt excluding revolving debt to consolidated ebitda ratio was x  providing million of consolidated ebitda cushion on the consolidated leverage ratio

these restricted payments are not subject to any specific covenants 
additional restricted payments are allowed to be made based on an excess cash flow formula  should our pro forma consolidated leverage ratio be less than or equal to x consolidated total debt excluding the revolving debt to consolidated ebitda as defined  measured on a quarterly basis 
per the terms of the indenture governing our notes  our ability to make restricted payments is permitted should our trailing twelve month total indebtedness to consolidated cash flow ratio be less than or equal to x consolidated total indebtedness including average revolving debt to consolidated ebitda  measured on a quarterly basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates  and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates on our operations in canada and  from time to time  on imported rides and equipment 
the objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed rate long term debt  interest rate swaps that fix a portion of our variable rate long term debt  and variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
translation exposures with regard to our canadian operations are not hedged 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify as effective hedging activities are reported as net effect of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  the other comprehensive income loss related to interest rate swaps that become ineffective is amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swap  and reported as a component of net effect of swaps in the consolidated statement of operations 
after considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements  at december   approximately billion of our outstanding long term debt represents fixed rate debt and approximately million represents variable rate debt 
assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings of approximately million  a hypothetical bps increase in day libor on our variable rate debt would lead to an increase of approximately million in annual cash interest costs due to the impact of our fixed rate swap agreements 
a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in a million decrease in annual operating income 
impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases could not be passed along to our guests 
in particular  increases in labor  supplies  taxes  and utility expenses could have an impact on our operating results 
the majority of our employees are seasonal and are paid hourly rates which are consistent with federal and state minimum wage laws 
historically  we have been able to pass along cost increases to guests through increases in admission  food  merchandise and other prices  and we believe that we will continue to have the ability to do so over the long term 
we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our operating results and financial condition have been and will continue to be minor
