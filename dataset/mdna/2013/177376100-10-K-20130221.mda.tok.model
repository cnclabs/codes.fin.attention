item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview citrix is a cloud computing company that enables mobile workstyles empowering people to work and collaborate from anywhere  accessing enterprise apps and data on any of the latest devices  as easily as they would in their own office simply and securely 
citrix cloud computing solutions help it and service providers build both private and public clouds  leveraging virtualization and networking technologies to deliver high performance  elastic and cost effective services for mobile workstyles 
we market and license our products directly to enterprise customers  over the web  and through systems integrators  or sis  in addition to indirectly through value added resellers  or vars  value added distributors  or vads  and original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
citrix is a delaware corporation founded on april  executive summary we believe our approach is unique in the market because we have combined innovative technologies to enable and power mobile workstyles 
our technologies mobilize desktops  apps  workloads and people to help our customers drive business value 
our mobile and desktop products are leaders in the area of desktop management  including desktop virtualization marketed as xendesktop and xenapp 
in addition  in january of  we acquired zenprise  inc  or zenprise  and its mobile device management  or mdm  products  which will be integrated with our citrix cloudgateway product offering to provide customers a complete solution for mobile enterprise management 
our networking and cloud products offer customers a value added approach to building and delivering it to end users  including our cloud networking products  which allow our customers to deliver services to mobile users with high performance  security and reliability  and our cloud platform products  which allow our customers to build scalable and reliable private and public cloud computing environments 
we believe this combination of products allows us to deliver a comprehensive end to end mobile lifestyles solution  and one that we believe  when considered as a whole  is competitively differentiated by its feature set and interoperability 
in today s business environment there is a sharp focus on it products and services that can reduce cost and deliver a quick  tangible return on investment  or roi 
with our customers focused on economic value in technology solutions  we continue highlighting our products abilities to reduce it costs  increase business flexibility and deliver roi with a simpler more flexible approach to computing 
in  we saw uncertainties surrounding it spending  particularly in the european markets 
through the third quarter of  we continued to encounter hesitancy on the part of customers in initiating large capital projects causing opportunities to be pushed into the future or to be split into smaller transactions 
in the fourth quarter of  we saw improvements in demand across all geographies  which contributed to our overall product and license revenue growth 
see our summary of results section below 
although we experienced greater demand in the fourth quarter of  we believe that continued economic uncertainty may adversely affect sales of our products and services and may result in longer sales cycles  slower adoption of technologies and increased price competition  particularly in north america and europe 
in  we plan to focus on helping our customers embrace and power mobile workstyles and build cloud infrastructure so cloud services can be delivered virtually anywhere with a high quality user experience 
we plan to sustain the long term growth of our businesses around the world by expanding our go to market reach and direct customer touch through hiring additional enterprise account managers and expanding consulting and technical support capacity  investing in product innovation  bringing new technologies to market and improving integration across our product portfolio to drive simplicity and better end user experience  and making selective and strategic acquisitions of technology  talent and or businesses 
we also plan to invest in new service provider channel programs that allow our partners to upgrade their capabilities in desktop virtualization  giving us more capacity to drive strategic mobile and desktop transactions and to cross sell cloud networking  cloud platforms  collaboration and data sharing 
enterprise division our desktop virtualization products are built to transform and reduce the cost of traditional desktop management by virtualizing the desktop  with our xendesktop product  and virtualizing applications  with our xenapp product  in a customer s datacenter 
we are moving the delivery of desktops and related applications to an on demand service rather than the delivery of a device 
we continue to see growing customer interest in xendesktop and  in addition  by making the xendesktop trade up program a standard program  we are maximizing our xenapp install base and driving continued xendesktop adoption 
in january  we completed our acquisition of zenprise  a privately held leading innovator in mdm 
we are currently working to integrate the zenprise products for mdm with our citrix cloudgateway product for managing mobile apps and data to offer our enterprise it customers comprehensive products that make it easier to manage and secure devices  apps and data  while allowing users to embrace mobile workstyles and access enterprise apps from virtually any device 
we believe our mobility products will offer a comprehensive approach that can transform organizations into mobile enterprises with the security and control it requires  the ease of use and flexibility users desire  and the productivity business demands 
our cloud networking products power mobile workstyles while altering the traditional economics of the datacenter by providing greater levels of flexibility of computing resources  especially with respect to servers  improving application performance and thereby reducing the amount of processing power involved  and allowing easy reconfiguration of servers by permitting storage and network infrastructure to be added in virtually rather than physically 
our cloud networking products are also enhancing our differentiation and driving customer interest around desktop virtualization as enterprises are finding good leverage in deploying these technologies together 
in july  we acquired bytemobile  inc  or bytemobile  a privately held leading provider of data and video optimization solutions for mobile network operators 
the bytemobile acquisition has given us a strategic foothold in the core infrastructure of certain mobile operators which are experiencing rapid growth in network traffic  driven by the combination of new consumer devices  rich multimedia content  and high speed g  g and lte networks 
our bytemobile smart capacity products combined with our citrix netscaler line of cloud networking products enhance our broader strategy of powering mobile workstyles and cloud services and allow us to offer mobile operators combined solutions that deliver a high quality user experience to mobile subscribers 
our cloud platform products allow our customers to build scalable and reliable private and public cloud computing environments where customers can quickly and easily build cloud services within their existing infrastructure and provision hosted applications  desktops  services and infrastructure as a service  or iaas  from the cloud 
online services division our online services division is focused on developing and marketing collaboration and data products 
these products are primarily marketed via the web to large enterprises  medium and small businesses  prosumers and individuals 
our online services division collaboration products offer secure and cost effective solutions that allow users to host and actively participate in online meetings  webinars and training sessions remotely and reduce costs associated with business travel 
in addition  we offer products that offer users a secure  simple and cost efficient way to access their desktops remotely and support over the internet on demand 
in the second quarter of  we acquired podio aps  or podio  a privately held provider of a cloud based collaborative work platform 
podio became part of our online services division and is a natural extension of our collaboration business  providing today mobile workforce an easy  secure and social way to come together and work as teams 
our data sharing product  sharefile  makes it easy for businesses of all sizes to securely store  sync and share business documents and files  both inside and outside the company 
sharefile centralized cloud storage capability also allows users to share files across multiple devices and access them from any location 
reclassifications during the first quarter of  we performed a review of the presentation of certain of our revenue categories and adopted a revised presentation  which we believe is more comparable to those presented by other companies in our industry and better reflects our evolving product and service offerings 
as a result  technical support  hardware maintenance and software updates revenues  which were previously presented in technical services and license updates are classified together as license updates and maintenance 
a corresponding change was made to rename cost of services revenues to cost of services and maintenance revenues  however  there was no change in classification 
product training and certification and consulting services  which were previously presented in technical services  are classified together as professional services 
product licenses has been renamed to product and licenses to more appropriately describe its composition of both software and hardware  however  there was no change in classification 
the composition and classification of software as a service remained unchanged 
this change in presentation will not affect our total net revenues  total cost of net revenues or gross margin 
additionally  during the first quarter of  we revised our methodology for allocating certain it support costs to more closely align these costs to the employees directly utilizing the related assets and services and to reflect how management assesses the cost of headcount 
as a result  certain it support costs have been reclassified from general and administrative expenses to cost of services and maintenance revenues  research and development expenses and sales  marketing and services expenses based on the headcount in each of these functional areas 
this change in presentation will not affect our income from operations or cash flows 
conforming changes have been made for all prior periods presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the reclassifications described above 
summary of results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   we delivered the following financial performance product and license revenue increased to million  software as a service revenue increased to million  license updates and maintenance revenue increased to  million  professional services revenue increased to million  operating income decreased to million  and diluted earnings per share decreased to 
the increase in our product and licenses revenue was primarily driven by sales of our networking and cloud products  led by netscaler and increased sales of our mobile and desktop products  led by xendesktop 
we currently target our product and licenses revenue to increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of our software as a service revenue increased due to increased sales of our collaboration products  led by gotomeeting and our data sharing product  sharefile 
the increase in license updates and maintenance revenue was primarily due to an increase in renewals and sales of our subscription advantage product and an increase in maintenance revenues  primarily driven by increased sales of our networking and cloud products  led by netscaler 
professional services revenue increased primarily due to increases in consulting revenues related to increased implementation sales of our enterprise division s products 
we currently target that total revenue to increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of in addition  when comparing the fiscal year to the fiscal year we target total revenue to increase 
the decrease in operating income and diluted net income per share when comparing to was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation costs primarily related to our retention focused annual stock grant to key employees and our recent acquisitions and an increase in amortization of intangible assets primarily related to our recent acquisitions 
also contributing to the decrease is an increase in cost of net revenues due to increases in sales of products with a hardware component and increased sales of our services  both of which have a higher cost than our software products

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent auditors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is earned and when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the service has been provided and we have no remaining obligations  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
we define these four criteria as follows persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists 
we primarily sell our software products via electronic or paper licenses and typically require a purchase order from the distributor  reseller or end user depending on the arrangement who have previously negotiated a master distribution or resale agreement and an executed product license agreement from the end user 
for appliance sales  our customary practice is to require a purchase order from distributors and resellers who have previously negotiated a master packaged product distribution or resale agreement 
we typically recognize revenue upon shipment for our appliance sales 
for maintenance  technical support  product training and consulting services  we require a purchase order and an executed agreement 
for saas  we generally require the customer or the reseller to electronically accept the terms of an online services agreement or execute a contract 
delivery has occurred and we have no remaining obligations 
we consider delivery of licenses under electronic licensing agreements to have occurred when the related products are shipped and the end user has been electronically provided the software activation keys that allow the end user to take immediate possession of the product 
for hardware appliance sales  our standard delivery method is free on board shipping point 
consequently  we consider delivery of appliances to have occurred when the products are shipped pursuant to an agreement and purchase order 
for saas  delivery occurs upon providing the users with their login id and password 
for product training and consulting services  we fulfill our obligation when the services are performed 
for license updates  maintenance and technical support  we assume that our obligation is satisfied ratably over the respective terms of the agreements  which are typically to months 
for saas  we assume that our obligation is satisfied ratably over the respective terms of the agreements  which are typically months 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
in the normal course of business  we do not provide customers with the right to a refund of any portion of their license fees or extended payment terms 
the fees are considered fixed or determinable upon establishment of an arrangement that contains the final terms of the sale including description  quantity and price of each product or service purchased 
for saas  the fee is considered fixed or determinable if it is not subject to refund or adjustment 
collectability is probable 
we determine collectability on a customer by customer basis and generally do not require collateral 
we typically sell product licenses and license updates to distributors or resellers for whom there are histories of successful collection 
new customers are typically subject to a credit review process that evaluates their financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
customers are also subject to an ongoing credit review process 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectability is not probable  revenue recognition is deferred until customer payment is received and the other parameters of revenue recognition described above have been achieved 
management s judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on an evaluation of customer specific information  historical experience and economic market conditions 
the majority of our product license revenue consists of revenue from the sale of stand alone software products 
stand alone software sales generally include a perpetual license to our software and are subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
in accordance with this guidance  we allocate revenue to license updates related to our stand alone software and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vsoe of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria described above have been met 
the balance of the revenues  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered 
if management cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on vsoe of fair value  revenue recognition is deferred until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
we also make certain judgments to record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives  at the time sales are recorded 
our hardware appliances contain software components that are essential to the overall functionality of the products 
for hardware appliance transactions entered into prior to january   revenue for arrangements with multiple elements  such as sales of products that included services  was allocated to each element using the residual method based on the vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered items pursuant to authoritative guidance 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements 
if vsoe of one or more undelivered items does not exist  revenue from the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized at the earlier of i delivery of those elements or ii when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element  in which case  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period 
for hardware appliance transactions entered into subsequent to january   the arrangement consideration is allocated to stand alone software deliverables as a group and the non software deliverables based on the relative selling prices of using the selling price hierarchy in the amended revenue recognition guidance 
the selling price hierarchy for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available  third party evidence  or tpe  if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition 
vsoe of selling price is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range based on historical discounting trends for specific products and services 
tpe of selling price is established by evaluating competitor products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers 
however  as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and our solutions offer substantially different features and functionality  the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained 
additionally  as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products selling prices are on a stand alone basis  we are not typically able to determine tpe 
the estimate of selling price is established considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices in different geographies and through different sales channels and competitor pricing strategies 
for our non software deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables 
for our hardware appliances we use esp as our selling price 
for our support and services  we generally use vsoe as our selling price 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe for our support and services  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
our saas products are considered service arrangements per the authoritative guidance  accordingly  fees related to online service agreements are recognized ratably over the contract term 
in addition  saas revenues may also include set up fees  which are recognized ratably over the contract term or the expected customer life  whichever is longer 
generally  our saas is sold separately and not bundled with enterprise division products and services 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for further information on our revenue recognition 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of the authoritative guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service or performance period  which is the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and a monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair of non vested stock unit awards that vest based on market and service conditions 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected term of the award  the risk free interest rate and any expected dividends 
for stock options  we determine the expected volatility factor  by utilizing the implied volatility in two year market traded options on our common stock based on third party volatility quotes in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
the expected term of our options is based on historical employee exercise patterns 
we also periodically analyze our historical pattern of option exercises based on certain demographic characteristics and we determined that there were no meaningful differences in option exercise activity based on demographic characteristics 
the approximate risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term on our options 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  we used a dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
for non vested stock unit awards that vest based on market and service conditions  the attainment level under each award will be based on our total return to stockholders over the performance period compared to the return on the nasdaq composite total return index  or the xcmp 
the range of expected volatilities utilized was based on the historical volatilities of our common stock and the xcmp 
we utilize historical volatility to value these awards because historical stock prices were used to develop the correlation coefficients between our stock performance and the xcmp in order to model the stock price movements 
the volatilities used were calculated over the most recent year period  which was the remaining term of the performance period at the date of grant 
the risk free interest rate was based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the remaining performance period 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  accordingly  we used a dividend yield of zero in our model 
in and  we issued non vested stock units with performance goals to senior level employees 
the number of non vested stock units underlying each award may be determined based on a range of attainment within defined performance goals 
we are required to estimate the attainment that will be achieved related to the defined performance goals and number of non vested stock units that will ultimately be awarded in order to recognize compensation expense over the vesting period 
if our initial estimates of performance goal attainment change  the related expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on those estimates and if the performance goals are not met  no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based payment awards that vest based on service  including those with graded vesting schedules  are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to options and non vested stock units 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating grant date fair value for our stock based awards or in future periods if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes models and monte carlo simulations  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for further information regarding our adoption of the authoritative guidance for stock based compensation 
valuation and classification of investments the authoritative guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price 
our available for sale investments are measured to fair value on a recurring basis and accordingly are carried at fair value 
in addition  we hold investments that are accounted for based on the cost method 
these investments are periodically reviewed for impairment and when indicators of impairment exist  are measured to fair value as appropriate on a non recurring basis 
in determining the fair value of our investments we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques 
the authoritative guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
the authoritative guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level  observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level  inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level  unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which requires us to develop our own assumptions 
observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are based on market data obtained from independent sources  such as market quoted prices 
when level observable inputs for our investments are not available to determine their fair value  we must then use other inputs which may include indicative pricing for securities from the same issuer with similar terms  yield curve information  benchmark data  prepayment speeds and credit quality or unobservable inputs that reflect our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the investments based on the best information available in the circumstances 
when valuation techniques  other than those described as level are utilized  management must make estimations and judgments in determining the fair value for its investments 
the degree to which management s estimation and judgment is required is generally dependent upon the market pricing available for the investments  the availability of observable inputs  the frequency of trading in the investments and the investment s complexity 
if we make different judgments regarding unobservable inputs we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of our investments 
after we have determined the fair value of our investments  for those that are in an unrealized loss position  we must then determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we review our investments quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment and if different judgments are used the classification of the losses related to our investments could differ 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the carrying value of an available for sale investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than carrying value our intent to retain or sell the investment and whether it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the investment before the recovery of its amortized cost basis  which may not be until maturity 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  rating agency actions and changes in credit default swap levels 
for our cost method investments  our quarterly review of impairment indicators encompasses the analysis of specific criteria of the entity  such as cash position  financing needs  operational performance  management changes  competition and turnaround potential 
if any of the above impairment indicators are present  we further evaluate whether an other than temporary impairment should be recorded 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources for more information on our investments and fair value measurements 
intangible assets we have acquired product related technology assets and other intangible assets from acquisitions and other third party agreements 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired intangible assets acquired through third party agreements based on their estimated relative fair values 
we allocate a portion of purchase price of acquired companies to the product related technology assets and other intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
we typically engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of product related technology assets and other intangible assets acquired 
such valuations and useful life determinations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in determining the fair value and useful lives of the product related technology assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows earned from the product related technology and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows 
critical estimates in valuing certain other intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  patents  brand awareness and market position  as well as discount rates 
management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
we monitor acquired intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis by reviewing indicators of impairment 
if an indicator exists we compare the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the intangible asset 
the recoverability of the intangible assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize products utilizing the acquired technologies  retain existing customers and customer contracts  and maintain brand awareness 
the estimated net realizable value of the acquired intangible assets is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such intangible assets 
our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of the performance of our products  customer retention rates and ability to secure and maintain our market position 
actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from product related technology assets and other intangible assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value 
if these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers and distributors  and there is no alternative future use for the technology  or if we fail to retain acquired customers or successfully market acquired brands  we could determine that some or all of the remaining million carrying value of our acquired intangible assets is impaired 
in the event of impairment  we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
goodwill the excess of the fair value of purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities from our acquisitions is recorded as goodwill 
at december   we had  million in goodwill related to our acquisitions 
the goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes 
our revenues are derived from sales of our enterprise division products  which include our mobile and desktop products  networking and cloud products and related license updates and maintenance and from sales of our online services division s collaboration and data products 
the enterprise division and the online services division constitute our two reportable segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for additional information regarding our reportable segments 
we evaluate goodwill between these segments  which represent our reporting units 
we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb s authoritative guidance  which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to an annual impairment test 
we complete our goodwill and certain intangible assets impairment test on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill and certain intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in  we early adopted the authoritative guidance  which provides entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further quantitative impairment testing for goodwill and certain intangible assets is necessary  which we refer to as the qualitative screen 
in performing the qualitative screen  we are required to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to the following the evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as related to our business  industry and market trends  and the overall future financial performance of our reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which they operate 
if after performing the qualitative screen impairment indicators are present  we would perform a quantitative impairment test to estimate the fair value of goodwill and certain intangible assets 
in doing so  we would estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the goodwill and certain intangible assets carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our results of operations 
we performed the qualitative screen for our goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of as a result of the qualitative screen  no further quantitative impairment test was deemed necessary 
there was no impairment of goodwill as a result of the annual impairment tests completed during the fourth quarters of and income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million in net deferred tax assets 
the authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that a million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits was necessary 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the following discussion relating to the individual financial statement captions  our overall financial performance  operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in overview and part item a entitled risk factors  included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   which could impact our future performance and financial position

product and licenses primarily represent fees related to the licensing of the following major products mobile and desktop formerly desktop solutions is primarily comprised of our desktop virtualization products xendesktop and xenapp  and networking and cloud formerly datacenter and cloud solutions is primarily comprised of cloud networking products  which include netscaler  cloud bridge including our product formerly known as branch repeater and bytemobile smart capacity  and the cloud platform products which include xenserver  cloudplatform formerly cloudstack and cloudportal 
in addition  we offer incentive programs to our vads and vars to stimulate demand for our products 
product and license revenues associated with these programs are partially offset by these incentives to our vads and vars 
license updates and maintenance consists of our subscription advantage program  an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of unspecified software upgrades  enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription  for which fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months  and our maintenance fees  which include technical support and hardware and software maintenance  and which are recognized ratably over the contract term 
professional services revenues are comprised of fees from consulting services related to implementation of our products  which are recognized as the services are provided  and fees from product training and certification  which are recognized as the services are provided 
our online services division s revenues  which are recognized ratably over the contractual term  consist of fees related to our saas products including collaboration products  which primarily include gotomeeting  gotowebinar  gototraining  gotomypc and gotoassist  data sharing product  which primarily includes sharefile 
during the first quarter of  we performed a review of the historical manner of presentation of certain of its revenue categories and adopted a revised presentation  which we believe is more comparable to those presented by other companies in the industry and better reflects our evolving product and service offerings 
as a result  technical support  hardware maintenance and software updates revenues  which were previously presented in technical services and license updates are classified together as license updates and maintenance 
a corresponding change was made to rename cost of services revenues to cost of services and maintenance revenues  however  there was no change in classification 
product training and certification and consulting services  which were previously presented in technical services  are classified together as professional services 
product licenses has been renamed to product and licenses to more appropriately describe its composition of both software and hardware  however  there was no change in classification 
the composition and classification of software as a service remained unchanged 
this change in manner of presentation will not affect our total net revenues  total cost of net revenues or gross margin 
year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands revenues product and licenses software as a service license updates and maintenance professional services total net revenues product and licenses product and licenses revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to increased sales of our networking and cloud products  led by netscaler  of million and increased sales of our mobile and desktop products  led by xendesktop  of million

we currently are targeting that license updates and maintenance revenue will increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of and when comparing the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of professional services professional services revenue increased during when compared to and during when compared to primarily due to increases in consulting revenues related to increased implementation sales of our enterprise division s products 
we currently target professional services revenue to increase when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of consistent with the increase in product and license revenue described above 
deferred revenue deferred revenues are primarily comprised of license updates and maintenance revenue from our subscription advantage product as well as maintenance and support contracts for our software and hardware products 
deferred revenues also includes saas revenue from annual service agreements for our online services and professional services revenue primarily related to our consulting contracts 
deferred revenues increased approximately million as of december  compared to december  primarily due to an increase in new and renewal sales of our subscription advantage product  led by xendesktop  of million  an increase in support sales related to our enterprise division products of million  an increase in sales of maintenance contracts  led by sales of netscaler  of million  and an increase related to bytemobile of million 
also contributing to the overall increase in deferred revenue is an increase in multi year contracts with our larger customers of our enterprise division 
we currently target deferred revenue to continue to increase in while it is generally our practice to promptly ship our products upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders  we sometimes have product license orders that have not shipped 
although the amount of such product license orders may vary  the amount  if any  of such product license orders at the end of a particular period has not been material to total revenue at the end of any reporting period 
we do not believe that backlog  as of any particular date  is a reliable indicator of future performance

operating expenses foreign currency impact on operating expenses the functional currency for all of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in our enterprise division is the us dollar 
a substantial majority of our overseas operating expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies and are therefore subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize the impact on our operating results  we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks up to months in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses 
when the dollar is weak  the resulting increase to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by the gain in our hedging contracts 
when the dollar is strong  the resulting decrease to foreign currency denominated expenses will be partially offset by the loss in our hedging contracts 
there is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the timeframe for which we hedge our risk 
research and development expenses year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands research and development research and development expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs and facility and equipment costs directly related to our research and development activities

amortization of other intangible assets year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands amortization of other intangible assets amortization of other intangible assets consists of amortization of customer relationships  trade names and covenants not to compete primarily related to our acquisitions 
the increase in amortization of other intangible assets when comparing to was primarily due to amortization of other intangible assets acquired in conjunction with our acquisitions  primarily bytemobile

for more information see liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  income taxes we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to us federal income taxes  as well as income taxes of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local  or non us  income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain and judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in june  we reached a settlement in principle with the internal revenue service  or irs  regarding certain previously disclosed income tax deficiencies asserted in a revenue agent s report  or the rar  the terms of which were approved in june  or the final approval 
under the terms of the settlement  we agreed to an assessment of income tax deficiencies in full settlement of all open claims under the rar and resolved with finality for future years all of the transfer pricing issues raised in the rar 
based on this  we incurred a charge of million in in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
in connection with the final approval  we finalized the tax deficiency calculations and formally closed all of our open issues with the irs relating to the and tax years 
because there were no changes from the agreement reached in  no additional amounts have been included in income tax expense during also  in june  we closed our irs examination for the through tax years 
we recognized a net tax benefit of million in related to the closing of tax audits with the irs for the through tax years  due to the reduction of the liability for uncertain tax positions for the closed tax years 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million in net deferred tax assets 
the authoritative guidance requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses and tax credits was necessary 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
we maintain certain strategic management and operational activities in overseas subsidiaries and our foreign earnings are taxed at rates that are generally lower than in the united states 
we do not expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 
our effective tax rate was approximately for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate when comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  was primarily due to the impact of the irs settlement for the tax years through  partially offset by the expiration of the us research and development tax credit for the tax year 
our effective tax rate generally differs from the us federal statutory rate of due primarily to lower tax rates on earnings generated by our foreign operations that are taxed primarily in switzerland 
we have not provided for us taxes for those earnings because we plan to reinvest all of those earnings indefinitely outside the united states 
our effective tax rate will fluctuate based on the mix of earnings from our us and foreign jurisdictions 
accordingly  earnings from the production and distribution of our products and services through our foreign headquarters in switzerland are currently taxed at lower income tax rates than earnings from our us operations 
the federal research and development credit expired on december  on january   the american taxpayer relief act of was signed into law 
under this act  the federal research and development credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after december  and before january  the effects of these changes in the tax law will result in net tax benefits of approximately million  which will be recognized in the first quarter of  which is the quarter in which the law was enacted 
liquidity and capital resources during  we generated operating cash flows of million 
these operating cash flows related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for  among other things  non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization expenses of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
also contributing to these cash inflows was an aggregate increase in operating assets and liabilities of million  net of effects of acquisitions 
our investing activities used million of cash consisting primarily of cash paid for acquisitions of million  the purchase of property and equipment of million and million in cash paid for licensing agreements and product related intangible assets and other investments 
these investing cash outflows were partially offset by net sales of investments of million 
our financing activities used cash of million primarily due to stock repurchases of million 
this financing cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based compensation plans of million 
during  we generated operating cash flows of million 
these operating cash flows related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for  among other things  non cash charges including depreciation and amortization expenses of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
also contributing to these cash inflows was an aggregate increase in operating assets and liabilities of million  net of the effects of acquisitions 
our investing activities used million of cash consisting primarily of cash paid for acquisitions of million  the purchase of property and equipment of million and million in cash paid for licensing agreements and product related intangible assets and other investments 
these investing cash outflows were partially offset by net sales of investments of million 
our financing activities used cash of million primarily due to stock repurchases of million 
this financing cash outflow was partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based compensation plans of million 
historically  significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations 
we currently expect this trend to continue throughout we believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives 
we could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions 
cash  cash equivalents and investments december  compared to in thousands cash  cash equivalents and investments the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  as compared to december   is primarily due to cash provided by our operating activities of million and cash received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock based compensation plans of million  partially offset by cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  of million  expenditures made on stock repurchases of million  purchases of property and equipment of million and purchases of cost method investments and product related intangible assets of million 
as of december   million of the  million of cash  cash equivalents and investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds are needed for our operations in the united states  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
our current plans are not expected to require repatriation of cash and investments to fund our us operations and  as a result  we intend to permanently reinvest our foreign earnings 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade  highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs 
our short term and long term investments primarily consist of interest bearing securities 
fair value measurements the authoritative guidance defines fair value as an exit price  representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  the guidance establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
available for sale securities included in level are valued utilizing inputs obtained from an independent pricing service  or the service  which uses quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments rather than direct observations of quoted prices in active markets 
the service gathers observable inputs for all of our fixed income securities from a variety of industry data providers including  for example  large custodial institutions and other third party sources 
once the observable inputs are gathered by the service  all data points are considered and an average price is determined 
the service s providers utilize a variety of inputs to determine their quoted prices 
these inputs may include interest rates  known historical trades  yield curve information  benchmark data  prepayment speeds  credit quality and broker dealer quotes 
substantially all of our available for sale investments are valued utilizing inputs obtained from the service and accordingly are categorized as level in the table below 
we periodically independently assess the pricing obtained from the service and historically have not adjusted the service pricing as a result of this assessment 
available for sale securities are included in level when relevant observable inputs for a security are not available 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy 
in certain instances  the inputs used to measure fair value may meet the definition of more than one level of the fair value hierarchy 
the input with the lowest level priority is used to determine the applicable level in the fair value hierarchy 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis our fixed income available for sale security portfolio generally consists of high quality  investment grade securities from diverse issuers with a minimum credit rating of a a and a weighted average credit rating of aa aa we values these securities based on pricing from the service  whose sources may use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level inputs or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly level inputs in determining fair value  and accordingly  we classify all of our fixed income available for sale securities as level see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for more information regarding our available for sale investments 
we measure our cash flow hedges  which are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other current liabilities  at fair value based on indicative prices in active markets level inputs 
assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level we have invested in convertible debt securities of certain early stage entities that are classified as available for sale investments 
as quoted prices in active markets or other observable inputs were not available for these investments  in order to measure them at fair value  we utilized a discounted cash flow model using a discount rate reflecting the market risk inherent in holding securities of an early stage enterprise  adjusted by the probability weighted exit possibilities associated with the convertible debt securities 
this methodology required us to make assumptions that were not directly or indirectly observable regarding the fair value of the convertible debt securities  accordingly they are a level valuation and is included in the purchases of level securities line in the table below 
during the third quarter of  one of these investments in a convertible debt security with a carrying amount of million was determined to be impaired based on the discounted cash flow model referenced above and has been written down to its fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
the valuation performed to determine the fair value of the convertible debt security required us to make assumptions that were not directly or indirectly observable  accordingly it is a level valuation and is included in the table below

realized losses included in earnings for the period are reported in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
assets measured at fair value on a non recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level during  certain of our cost method investments with a carrying value of million were determined to be impaired and have been written down to their combined fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million  which is included in other income expense  net in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in determining the fair value of cost method investments we consider many factors including but not limited to operating performance of the investee  the amount of cash that the investee has on hand  the ability to obtain additional financing and the overall market conditions in which the investee operates 
the fair value of the cost method investment represents a level valuation as the assumptions used in valuing this investment were not directly or indirectly observable 
additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements the carrying value of accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short maturity of these items 
accounts receivable  net december  compared to in thousands accounts receivable allowance for returns allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net the increase in accounts receivable at december  compared to december  was primarily due to increase in sales  particularly in the last month of compared to the last month of the activity in our allowance for returns was comprised primarily of million of provisions for returns recorded during partially offset by million in credits issued for returns

from time to time  we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances from our distributors or customers  which are comprised of large business enterprises  governments and small and medium sized businesses 
if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorates  our operating results could be adversely affected

we may use the approved dollar authority to repurchase stock at any time until the approved amounts are exhausted 
the objective of our stock repurchase program is to improve stockholders returns 
at december   approximately million was available to repurchase common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program 
all shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheets included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  a portion of the funds used to repurchase stock over the course of the program was provided by proceeds from employee stock option exercises and the related tax benefit 
we are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule b plan 
additionally  from time to time  we may enter into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds in order to lower the average cost to acquire shares 
these programs include terms that require us to make up front payments to the counterparty financial institution and result in the receipt of stock during or at the end of the agreement or the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreement  depending on market conditions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events  gains or losses 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
the counterparties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results could differ materially 
discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  exposure to exchange rates a substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  including euros  british pounds sterling  japanese yen  australian dollars  swiss francs  indian rupees  hong kong dollars  canadian dollars  singapore dollars and chinese renminbi 
to reduce our exposure to a reduction in us dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
our hedging program significantly reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
at december  and  we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair value asset of million and at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair value liability of million 
based on a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates  the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by million 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by million  resulting in a net asset position 
in these hypothetical movements  foreign operating costs would move in the opposite direction 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as the prices of our competitors products become more or less attractive 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these foreign exchange forward contracts 
exposure to interest rates we have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale investments 
we maintain available for sale investments in debt securities and we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
if market interest rates were to decrease by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would increase by approximately million and million  respectively 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our available for sale and trading investment portfolios 
this analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment
