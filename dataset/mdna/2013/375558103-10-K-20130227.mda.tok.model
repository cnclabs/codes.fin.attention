below is a summary of our key accomplishments during completed the billion acquisition of pharmasset  inc pharmasset  acquired the lead compound now known as sofosbuvir  a nucleotide analog being evaluated for the treatment of hcv infection and accelerated our timeline to develop the first all oral hcv regimen as a result of the acquisition  expanded worldwide access to complera eviplera  now available in countries  expanded our research and development r d pipeline with over active phase clinical studies at the end of  submitted marketing applications in the united states and european union for elvitegravir  an integrase inhibitor for the treatment of hiv infection in treatment experienced adults  and cobicistat  a pharmacoenhancing or boosting agent that increases blood levels to allow once daily dosing of certain hiv medicines 
the us food and drug administration fda has set target review dates of april under the prescription drug user fee act  obtained fda approval for and launched stribild  our third single tablet regimen for the treatment of hiv in the united states  announced the acquisition of ym biosciences ym  which closed in february  and will expand our growing oncology inflammation pipeline  and obtained fda approval for once daily oral truvada  in combination with safer sex practices  for pre exposure prophylaxis prep to reduce the risk of hiv infection among uninfected adults 
outlook our operating objectives for include increasing the market share of our commercial products  continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally developed and or externally in licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances 
from an r d perspective  we will continue advancing our growing product pipeline 
our focus will be on progressing our efforts towards filing marketing applications for sofosbuvir for the treatment of hcv  developing additional innovative hiv single tablet regimens and advancing new product candidates for the treatment of oncology and inflammation diseases 
as a result  we expect to move forward on a number of important late stage clinical studies related to hiv  hcv  oncology and inflammation 
from a commercial perspective  we have a number of initiatives to promote the continued growth of our franchises 
in the hiv area  the scientific support for earlier diagnosis and treatment  along with the use of single tablet regimens remains compelling both medically and practically 
in anticipation of receiving regulatory approval for sofosbuvir  we will begin to build our commercial organization to support the expected launch of this product in in  we launched stribild  a single tablet regimen for the treatment of hiv in the united states 
in  we expect continued strong uptake of stribild in the united states 
our marketing application for stribild is currently being reviewed by the european medicines agency  and if approved  we expect to make the product available in the second quarter of in the hbv area  we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on asian communities in the united states  highlighting the need to screen  diagnose and link patients to care 
in the cardiovascular area  we will continue our efforts to raise awareness of gilead in the pulmonary arterial hypertension and cardiology communities 
we are mindful that conditions in the current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals 
some of the factors that could affect our business include changes to legislation that may delay or impact funding for adaps in the united states  a continuation or worsening of economic conditions in certain key markets  particularly in europe  patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic competitors  continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
we will continue to monitor these conditions and will adjust our business processes  as appropriate  to attempt to mitigate these risks to our business 
we believe the successes we experienced in have enabled us to continue to build a financially sound business model that will allow us to continue to further expand our commercial and r d activities and to maintain quality and compliance 
as we continue to grow our business  we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for financial highlights during  total revenues grew to billion  driven by strong underlying demand for our products 
total product sales were billion for  an increase of over due primarily to growth in our antiviral franchise  which increased to billion compared to the prior year 
sales of letairis  ranexa and ambisome together surpassed the billion mark  reaching billion  an increase of compared to the prior year 
royalty revenues from our collaborations with corporate partners were million  an increase of compared to the prior year

we continued investing in our phase clinical studies  particularly in liver disease and oncology 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were billion for  an increase of million or over  reflective of the ongoing growth of our business and an increase in the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from us healthcare reform 
net income for was billion or per diluted share  a decrease from billion or per diluted share in  primarily due to the continued progression and investment of our product pipeline  and an increase in our effective tax rate resulting from a shift in our geographic mix of earnings  expiration of the federal research tax credit and an increase in acquisition related expenses for which we receive no tax benefit 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled billion  a decrease from billion as of december  in january  we completed the pharmasset acquisition which we financed with approximately billion in cash on hand  billion in senior unsecured notes issued in december and billion in bank debt issued in january we generated over billion in operating cash flows during  some of which we used to repay approximately billion in debt financing and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock for million 
results of operations total revenues total revenues include product sales  royalty revenues  and contract and other revenues 
total revenues were billion in  billion in and billion in increases in total revenues were driven by growth in product sales 
product sales total product sales were billion in  an increase of over total product sales of billion in  primarily driven by continued growth in sales of antiviral products  including atripla  truvada and complera eviplera 
the increase also reflected sales growth in other products  primarily letairis  ranexa and ambisome  which reached billion in compared to million in total product sales increased by in compared to billion in  primarily driven by the growth of atripla and truvada 
more than of our product sales are generated outside the united states and as a result  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily in euro 
we used foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our foreign currency exposure 
foreign currency exchange  net of hedges  had an unfavorable impact of million on our revenues compared to and a favorable impact of million on our revenues compared to product sales in the united states increased for to billion compared to billion in  primarily driven by higher underlying demand for our antiviral products and the launch of stribild in august product sales in other therapeutic areas also contributed to the growth 
letairis sales totaled million in  an increase of compared to ranexa sales totaled million in  an increase of compared to ambisome sales totaled million in  an increase of compared to product sales in europe increased for to billion compared to billion in  primarily driven by higher underlying demand in our antiviral franchise 
antiviral product sales in europe totaled billion in  an increase of compared to billion in  primarily driven by the sales of atripla and truvada 
foreign currency exchange  net of hedges  had an unfavorable impact of million on our european product sales in compared to total product sales are expected to grow in  as we realize the full year impact of sales of stribild and continued growth of complera eviplera and products in our cardiovascular franchise 
we believe this growth could be tempered by uncertainty around the timing of approval of the us federal budget  the possibility of an automatic reduction in federal spending  or sequestration in march  the unavailability or delay in aids drug assistance programs adap funding and the challenging economic environment in europe 
our results are also subject to continued potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates

research and development expenses change change research and development we manage our r d expenses by identifying the r d activities we anticipate will be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data  probability of successful development  market potential  available human and capital resources and other considerations 
we continually review our r d pipeline and the status of development and  as necessary  reallocate resources among the r d portfolio that we believe will best support the future growth of our business 
r d expenses summarized above consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations cros  materials and supplies  licenses and fees  milestone payments under collaboration arrangements  personnel costs  including salaries  benefits and stock based compensation and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
the following table provides a breakout of r d expenses by major cost type in thousands clinical studies and outside services personnel expenses facilities  it and other costs ipr d impairment charges total compared to  in  clinical studies and outside services increased million due to progression and expansion of our phase studies  particularly in liver disease and oncology  and personnel expenses increased million due to higher headcount to support our product pipeline and study progression

this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in ipr d impairment charges 
during  we recorded million of impairment charges related to certain ipr d assets acquired from cgi pharmaceuticals  inc cgi 
these impairment charges were a result of changes in the anticipated market share related to the syk compound 
during  we recorded million of impairment charges related to certain ipr d assets acquired from cv therapeutics  inc the majority of the impairment charge related to our gs program  a product candidate that was in phase clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia  which was terminated in the fourth quarter of due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients 
in  we expect r d expenses to increase over levels due to continued investment in our internal and collaborative r d efforts and advancement of our product pipeline  driven primarily by the progression of our phase clinical studies in the liver disease and oncology areas 
selling  general and administrative expenses change change selling  general and administrative sg a expenses relate to sales and marketing  finance  human resources  legal and other administrative activities

the increase was due primarily to a million increase in costs associated with the growth of our business which include personnel and headcount related expenses  a million increase in stock based compensation expenses primarily resulting from the acquisition of pharmasset and an increase of million in the pharmaceutical excise tax resulting from us healthcare reform 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in bad debt provisions of million  which included a gain of million related to the sale of our accounts receivables balances in spain in the second quarter of compared to  in  sg a expenses increased million or  due primarily to increased contract  legal and other professional services of million  pharmaceutical excise tax of million  increased compensation and benefits expenses of million as a result of higher headcount to support our expanding commercial activities  promotional costs of million driven by our expanding sales and marketing activities and bad debt provisions of million associated with slower collections in southern european countries 
in  we expect sg a expenses to increase over to support the expansion of our business including the pre launch activities in preparation for the anticipated nda filing of sofosbuvir in the first half of and an increase in the pharmaceutical excise tax 
we also expect bad debt provisions to return to historical levels as included significant collections of past due accounts receivable in spain and portugal  that we do not expect to occur in interest expense compared to  in  interest expense increased to million 
the increase was due primarily to the additional debt we issued in connection with our acquisition of pharmasset  which included billion in senior unsecured notes issued in december and billion in bank debt issued in january compared to  in  interest expense increased to million 
the increase in interest expense was due primarily to the issuance of our convertible senior notes for billion in july  the issuance of our senior unsecured notes for billion in march  and the issuance of our senior unsecured notes for billion in december this increase was partially offset by the maturity of our convertible senior notes due in may  which had an aggregate principal balance of million 
other income expense  net for  other income expense  net was a net expense of million compared to income of million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in other income expense  net  in compared to was due primarily to decreased interest income resulting from lower cash and marketable securities balances and yields and a million loss on greek bonds related to greece restructuring of its sovereign debt in the first quarter of the increase in other income expense  net  in compared to was driven primarily by a favorable net foreign currency exchange impact and an increase in interest income  partially offset by an increase in costs related to our hedging activities

in january  the us congress passed the american taxpayer relief act of which retroactively reinstated the federal research tax credit for and as a result  our income tax provision for the first quarter of will include a discrete tax benefit related to the federal research tax credit for which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and to a lesser extent  the annual effective tax rate 
acquisition of pharmasset in january  we completed the acquisition of pharmasset  a publicly held clinical stage pharmaceutical company committed to discovering  developing and commercializing novel drugs to treat viral infections 
pharmasset primary focus was the development of oral therapeutics for the treatment of hcv infection 
pharmasset lead compound  now known as sofosbuvir formally known as gs  is a nucleotide analog which  as of january  was being evaluated in phase and phase clinical studies for the treatment of hcv infection across genotypes 
we believe the acquisition of pharmasset provides us with an opportunity to complement our existing hcv portfolio and helps advance our effort to develop all oral regimens for the treatment of hcv 
we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of pharmasset for per share in cash through a tender offer and subsequent merger under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger entered into in november the aggregate cash payment to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock was billion 
we financed the transaction with approximately billion in cash on hand  billion in senior unsecured notes issued in december and billion in bank debt issued in january the pharmasset acquisition was accounted for as a business combination 
the results of operations of pharmasset have been included in our consolidated statement of income since january   the date on which we acquired approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of pharmasset  cash consideration was transferred  and as a result  we obtained effective control of pharmasset 
the acquisition was completed on january   at which time pharmasset became a wholly owned subsidiary of gilead and was integrated into our operations 
as we do not track earnings results by product candidate or therapeutic area  we do not maintain separate earnings results for the acquired pharmasset business 
the following table summarizes the components of the cash paid to acquire pharmasset in thousands total consideration transferred stock based compensation expense total cash paid the billion cash payment consisted of a billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders as well as a million cash payment to option holders under the pharmasset stock option plans 
the billion cash payment to the outstanding common stockholders and million of the cash payment to vested option holders under the pharmasset stock option plans were accounted for as consideration transferred 
the remaining million of cash payment was accounted for as stock based compensation expense resulting from the accelerated vesting of pharmasset employee options immediately prior to the acquisition 
the following table summarizes the acquisition date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and the consideration transferred in thousands identifiable intangible assets cash and cash equivalents other assets acquired liabilities assumed  net total identifiable net assets goodwill total consideration transferred identifiable intangible assets we acquired intangible assets  primarily comprised of the sofosbuvir in process research and development ipr d compound  which had an estimated fair value of billion as of the date of acquisition 
the fair value was determined using a probability weighted income approach that discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the estimated net cash flows were discounted using a discount rate of  which is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to that of pharmasset 
this rate is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for the acquisition and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible asset 
the projected cash flows were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to each project considering its stage of development on the acquisition date  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the product candidate  the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory agencies  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
intangible assets related to ipr d projects are considered to be indefinite lived assets and are not amortized until the completion or abandonment of the associated r d efforts 
goodwill the million of goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is attributable to the synergies expected from combining our r d operations with pharmasset 
none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes 
stock based compensation expense the stock based compensation expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of employee options immediately prior to the acquisition was reported in our consolidated statement of income as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense total stock based compensation expense other costs other costs incurred in connection with the acquisition include in thousands year ended december  transaction costs eg investment advisory  legal and accounting fees bridge financing costs restructuring costs total other costs the following table summarizes these costs by the line item in the consolidated statement of income in which these costs were recognized in thousands year ended december  research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense interest expense total other costs liquidity and capital resources we believe that our existing capital resources  supplemented by our cash flows generated from operating activities  as well as cash flow from financing activities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities resulting from a business combination and our tax provision 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product sales we recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery to the customer has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as medicaid reimbursements  customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment  distributor fees and expected returns of expired products 
these estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized 
of these reductions from gross product sales  government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management 
government rebates allowances and accrued government rebates we estimate reductions to our revenues for government managed medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal  state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs 
these reductions are settled either by us being invoiced directly or through charge backs from our wholesalers 
government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in accrued government rebates on our consolidated balance sheets 
for qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price  the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price  which we record as allowances against accounts receivable 
although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the united states  to date  payments made to foreign governments have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates 
for government programs in the united states  we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms  historical utilization rates  new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates  our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major us wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements 
during  and  u 
s government rebates and chargebacks of billion  billion and billion  respectively  representing  and of total gross product sales  respectively  were deducted from gross product sales 
we believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances 
however  actual results may differ 
based on the current information available to us  actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than from our estimates recorded in those periods 
as of december  and  we had accrued us government rebates of million and million  respectively  in accrued government rebates and had an allowance for government chargebacks of million and million  respectively  recorded against accounts receivable 
the following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our us government rebates allowance and accrued government rebate accounts balance at beginning of year charged to expense deducted from accruals balance at end of year year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued government rebates activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued government rebates activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including  but not limited to  contractual payment terms  historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances  an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  however  significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
valuation of intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities resulting from a business combination in conjunction with our business combinations  we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to ipr d projects  and we have recorded contingent consideration liabilities payable upon the achievement of specified development  regulatory approval or sales based milestone events 
both the identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date 
the models used in valuing these intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates  the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates  the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed annually for impairment  or when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
we revalue contingent consideration obligations each quarter following the acquisition and record increases or decreases in their fair value in r d expense within our consolidated statement of income 
increases or decreases in the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and contingent consideration liabilities can result from updates to assumptions such as the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestones  changes in projected revenues or changes in discount rates 
significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
updates to assumptions could have a significant impact on our results of operations in any given period 
actual results may differ from estimates 
as of december  and  we had total intangible assets of billion and billion  respectively  and contingent consideration liabilities of million and million  respectively 
tax provision we estimate our income tax provision  including deferred tax assets and liabilities  based on significant management judgment 
we evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance  we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made 
various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  interpretations of existing tax laws  changes in tax laws and rates  our portion of the non deductible pharmaceutical excise tax  the accounting for stock options and other share based payments  mergers and acquisitions  future levels of r d spending  changes in accounting standards  changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  changes in overall levels of pre tax earnings and resolution of federal  state and foreign income tax audits 
the impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on our net income 
we record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements  although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 
at december  and  we had total federal  state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of million and million  respectively 
of the total unrecognized tax benefits  million and million at december  and  respectively  if recognized  would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition 
as of december   we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change in the next months as we do not expect to have clarification from the irs and other tax authorities regarding any of our uncertain tax positions 
we file federal  state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the united states and abroad 
for federal income tax purposes  the statute of limitations is open for and onwards 
for certain acquired entities  the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years 
for california income tax purposes  the statute of limitations is open for and onwards 
our income tax returns are audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we are currently under examination by the irs for the and tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions 
there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations  and as a result  significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations  operating leases  capital commitments  purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory related items and clinical trials contracts 
the following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations  future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations capital commitments purchase obligations clinical trials total long term debt obligations include future interest payments based on fixed rates of  and for our convertible senior notes due in may  may and may  respectively 
long term debt obligations also include future interest payments based on fixed rates of    and for our senior unsecured notes due in december  december  april  december and december  respectively 
at december   the aggregate carrying values of our convertible notes and senior unsecured notes were billion and billion  respectively 
at december   we had firm capital project commitments of approximately million primarily relating to facilities improvement projects 
at december   we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory related items 
these amounts include minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing  collaboration and development arrangements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and have not been included in the table above 
at december   we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to cros 
although all of our material contracts with cros are cancelable  we historically have not cancelled such contracts 
these amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to  or terminations of  existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts 
we had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of million as of december  we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly change in the next months as we do not expect to have clarification from the irs and other tax authorities regarding any of our uncertain tax positions 
the unrecognized tax benefits were included in long term income taxes payable and non current deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet and have not been included in the table above 
recent accounting pronouncement in july  the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
entities will be allowed the option to first perform a qualitative assessment on impairment for indefinite lived intangible assets to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary 
this guidance is effective for impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted 
we elected to early adopt this guidance as of december  which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and credit risks 
to reduce certain of these risks  we enter into various types of foreign currency or interest rate derivative hedging transactions  follow investment guidelines and monitor outstanding receivables as part of our risk management program 
foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states  canada and ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the united states  including europe and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which is the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens against these currencies  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
more than of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during to partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales  we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts 
we also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid 
in general  the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged 
as of december  and  we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of billion and billion  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december   would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately million on this date and  if realized  would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december   would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately million on this date and  if realized  would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contracts 
the analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset 
interest rate risk our portfolio of available for sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk 
with respect to our investment portfolio  we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating  maturity  industry group and investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive after tax rate of return 
the following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest generating assets and fixed interest bearing liabilities at december  dollars in thousands expected maturity total fair value at december  thereafter total assets available for sale debt securities average interest rate liabilities long term debt average interest rate in december  we issued senior unsecured notes due in december   and in a registered offering 
the notes pay interest at fixed annual rates ranging from to 
in march  we issued senior unsecured notes due in april in a registered offering 
the notes pay interest at a fixed annual rate of in july  we issued convertible senior notes due in may and may in a private placement pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes due in may and may were issued at par and bear interest rates of and  respectively  and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances 
in april  we issued convertible senior notes due in may in a private placement pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of  and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances 
during the first quarter of  in connection with our acquisition of pharmasset  we entered into credit agreements that are subject to variable interest rates 
during  the portion of interest expense related to variable interest totaled million 
credit risk we are subject to credit risk from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
under our investment policy  we limit amounts invested in such securities by credit rating  maturity  industry group  investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
we are not exposed to any significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and a competitive after tax rate of return 
we are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales 
the majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the united states and europe 
during the second quarter of  we received payment on million in past due accounts receivable from customers based in spain 
included in this amount were proceeds from a one time factoring arrangement where we sold receivables with a carrying value of million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we received proceeds of million and recorded a gain of million  resulting primarily from the reversal of the related allowance for doubtful accounts 
this gain was recorded as an offset to sg a expenses in our consolidated statement of income 
subsequent to this transaction  we have had no continuing involvement with the transferred receivables  which were derecognized at the time of the sale 
as of december   our accounts receivable in southern europe  specifically greece  italy  portugal and spain  totaled approximately million  of which million were past due greater than days and million were past due greater than days 
as of december   our accounts receivable in southern europe  specifically greece  italy  portugal and spain totaled approximately billion  of which million were past due greater than days and million were past due greater than days 
to date  we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate at december
