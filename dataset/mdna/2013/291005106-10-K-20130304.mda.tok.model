item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus is the nation s largest provider of assisted living and alzheimer s memory care services 
as of december   we operated senior living communities in states 
fiscal in review emeritus results for fiscal reflect the resiliency of our business model  the needs driven nature of our primarily assisted living business and the talent and dedication of our employees 
our business has performed well this year despite the slow growth in the economy 
we continued to execute our business strategy  which includes acquisitions  as discussed in detail in 
business business strategy  in this form k 
our business fundamentals remain consistent  as evidenced by growth in revenue  revenue per unit  and average occupancy rate in our same community portfolio as defined below under 
same community portfolio 
we completed two significant transactions in the fourth quarter of we added communities to our consolidated portfolio that we had previously managed for the sunwest jv  and an additional four sunwest jv communities are expected to be added to our consolidated portfolio in early when their sale by the sunwest jv to hcp is expected to close 
this transaction took place approximately three years sooner than we had previously forecasted  due in part to the operational improvements we achieved since we began operating the communities in august following the initial closing of the hcp transaction  we acquired nurse on call  inc noc  the largest provider of medicare licensed home healthcare services in florida 
the noc acquisition provides us with our own platform for expanding home health services in our senior living communities in  total operating revenues increased to billion from billion in and billion in operating income from continuing operations was million in compared to million in and million in we recorded a net loss attributable to our common shareholders of million in compared to net losses of million in and million in positive cash flows generated by operating activities amounted to million in compared to million in and million in looking ahead to the united states economy remains sluggish and we cannot predict future economic conditions or their impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
however  we continue to believe that the needs driven nature of our business  potential pent up demand for and limited supply of new senior housing construction in our sector will support improved operating performance  especially if combined with economic recovery 
for  we expect significant revenue growth driven by our acquisitions  which will reflect a full year of revenue in  and by continued improvements in our same community portfolio 
as part of our long term strategy  we intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions in certain target markets that will allow us to increase our capacity and improve our operating efficiencies

significant transactions during   and  we entered into a number of transactions that affected our financing arrangements  our capital structure  and the number of communities we own  lease  and manage 
these transactions are summarized below 
our most significant senior living transaction in recent years affecting the number of communities that we operate was our participation in the sunwest jv 
during the last half of  the sunwest jv acquired communities previously operated by sunwest  which we managed for a fee equal to of gross 
table of contents collected revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  the sunwest jv entered into a purchase and sale agreement with hcp and emeritus whereby the sunwest jv agreed to sell of its communities to hcp and hcp agreed to lease of the communities to emeritus the hcp leased communities and sell nine communities to emeritus the emeritus nine communities 
as of december   the sunwest jv had closed on the sale of of the communities  including the emeritus nine communities  and expects to close on the remaining four in  as noted above 
in june  we acquired blackstone s ownership interest in communities that we managed on behalf of the blackstone jv  a previously unconsolidated joint venture in which emeritus owned and blackstone owned of the ownership interests

results of operations sources of revenues as described in item business  we generate revenues by providing senior housing and related healthcare services to the senior population 
we are the largest provider of assisted living and memory care services in the united states  with a capacity for approximately  residents 
assisted living and memory care units comprise approximately of our total operated portfolio 
the two basic drivers of our community revenues are the rates we charge our residents and the occupancy levels we achieve in our communities 
in evaluating the rate component  we utilize the average monthly revenue per occupied unit  computed by dividing the total operating revenue for a particular period by the average number of occupied units for the same period 
in evaluating the occupancy component  we track the average occupancy rate  computed by dividing the average units occupied during a particular period by the average number of units available during the period 

table of contents we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our charges for senior living services from their own or family resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
private pay residents represent of our payor mix 
we believe that only residents with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities  and that the rates we charge and our occupancy levels are interrelated 
therefore  we continuously evaluate rate and occupancy in each community to find the optimal balance so that we can benefit from our increasing capacity and anticipated future occupancy increases 
although our business is primarily needs driven  we believe that our occupancy growth has been slowed due to slow economic growth  as some seniors and their families have postponed moves for financial reasons  and we believe that high unemployment has enabled family members and others to provide home care for seniors 
revenues from government reimbursement programs  which are the federal medicare and state medicaid programs  represented of our community revenues in compared to in and in the increase in is due primarily to the acquisition of noc in november the increase in is due primarily to the lease acquisition of communities in november that included skilled nursing units  most of which receive medicare reimbursement 
the extent to which future changes in medicare and medicaid programs affect the revenues from our existing communities will depend upon factors that include resident mix  levels of acuity among our residents  overall occupancy and government reimbursement rates 
in  we expect an increase in the percentage of revenue attributable to government reimbursement programs as a result of our noc acquisition 
there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers in the future 
the budget control act of mandated  among other things  that medicare payments be reduced effective in january if lawmakers were unable to reach a compromise with respect to deficit reduction 
these cuts cannot be offset through higher co pays or other charges to patients 
the american taxpayer relief act  effective january   delayed until march  the mandatory sequestration cuts mandated by the budget control act of we believe that we can offset medicare cuts  if any  through targeted expense reductions  however  the reductions would not fully offset the potential revenue decrease 
we also earn management fee revenues by managing certain communities for third parties  including communities owned by related parties and by joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest 
the majority of our management agreements provide for fees equal to of gross collected revenues 
in addition to our monthly management fee  we receive reimbursement for operating expenses of managed communities 
during the second quarter of  we determined that the company is the primary obligor for certain expenses incurred and those reimbursed operating expenses should be reported on a gross rather than net basis  as had been reported in prior periods 
consequently  such expenses should be reported as costs incurred on behalf of managed communities and included in total operating expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations with a corresponding amount of revenue recognized in the same period in which the expense is incurred and the company is due reimbursement 
the prior period financial statements included in this filing have been revised to reflect this correction  which increased our total operating expenses and total operating revenues by million for and million for these revisions were limited to total operating revenues and expenses and had no impact on the company s condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows  operating income from continuing operations  or net loss 
we do not consider such revisions to be material to any previously issued financial statements 
as a result of the fourth quarter transactions described above  the number of communities managed for others was reduced significantly as of such managed communities became leased communities and nine became owned communities 
we expect a significant reduction in reimbursed costs incurred on behalf of managed communities in

these transaction expenses contributed  to our portion of the equity losses in equity earnings and losses related to the blackstone jv are impacted by changes in the fair value of its interest rate swap  which were recorded in the blackstone jv s earnings until our june  acquisition of these communities 
changes in the fair value of this swap resulted in equity earnings of  in and  in excluding the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap  equity earnings from the blackstone jv would have been  and  in and  respectively 
the average occupancy rate for our unconsolidated joint ventures increased to in from in  due primarily to an overall increase in occupancy in the sunwest jv 
average monthly revenue per occupied unit decreased to  in from  in  primarily as a result of our purchase of the blackstone jv communities  which had higher overall rates than our other unconsolidated joint ventures

see note  discontinued operations and note  fair value disclosures impairment of long lived assets 
loss from discontinued operations in consisted primarily of losses on the sales of two communities 
we did not reclassify the revenues and expenses of communities sold in and to loss from discontinued operations because we do not believe that the results of operations are material to the consolidated statements of operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash on hand of million compared to million at december  the company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception  and we had working capital deficits of million and million at december  and  respectively 
due to the nature of our business  it is not unusual to operate in the position of a working capital deficit because we collect revenues much more quickly  often in advance  than we are required to pay obligations  and we have historically refinanced or extended maturities of debt obligations as they become current liabilities 
our operations result in a very low level of current assets to the extent cash has been deployed in business development opportunities or to pay down long term liabilities 
along those lines  the working capital deficit as of december  included a million deferred tax asset and  as part of current liabilities  million of deferred revenue and unearned rental income 
a million deferred tax liability is included in other long term liabilities 
we do not expect the level of current liabilities to change from period to period in such a way as to require the use of significant cash  except for million in scheduled balloon payments of principal on long term debt maturing during the next months  which is included in current portion of long term debt as of december  we intend to refinance  extend  or retire these obligations prior to their maturities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such refinancing or be able to retire the obligations 

table of contents sources and uses of cash we expect to use our cash to invest in our core business as well as other new business opportunities related to our core business  such as the expansion of our ancillary services business 
as discussed above  we expect to refinance or extend our balloon debt payments in  however  if we are unable to do so  we believe the company would be able to generate sufficient cash flows to support its operating and investing activities and financing obligations for at least the next months by conserving its capital expenditures and operating expenses or selling communities or a combination thereof 
additionally  we expect to receive cash distributions from the wind down of the sunwest jv in totaling approximately million  assuming the release in full of all funds held in escrow in connection with the hcp transaction 
in connection with emeritus guarantees of certain debt and lease agreements  we are required at all times to maintain a minimum million balance of unencumbered liquid assets  defined as cash  cash equivalents and or publicly traded quoted marketable securities 
as a result  million of our cash on hand is not available to fund operations and we take this into account in our cash management activities 
we may use our available cash resources for acquisitions and other investments in support of our growth strategy 
significant acquisitions and or other new business opportunities will likely require additional outside funding 
we do not plan to pay cash dividends to our common shareholders in the foreseeable future 
other than normal operating expenses  we expect that cash requirements for will consist primarily of capital expenditures 
we expect to increase expenditures both to preserve and maintain our communities as well as to reposition or otherwise invest in return generating projects 
we also expect to invest in systems and technology in the communities and in our overall support infrastructure

financial covenants and cross defaults many of our debt instruments  leases  and corporate guarantees contain financial covenants that require that the company maintain specified financial criteria as of the end of each reporting period 
these financial covenants generally prescribe operating performance metrics such as debt or lease coverage ratios  operating income yields  fixed charge coverage ratios and or minimum occupancy requirements 
others are based on financial metrics such as minimum cash or net worth balances or have material adverse change clauses 
remedies available to the counterparties to these arrangements in the event of default vary but include the requirement to post a security deposit in specified amounts  acceleration of debt or lease payments  and or the termination of related lease agreements 
in addition  many of the lease and debt instruments contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations 
accordingly  an event of default could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition if a lender or landlord exercised its rights under an event of default 
as of december   the company had approximately billion of mortgage debt and notes payable outstanding comprised of the following mortgage debt financed through freddie mac and fannie mae of approximately billion  or approximately of our total debt outstanding excluding vehicle and equipment loans 
these obligations were incurred to facilitate community acquisitions over the past few years  were issued to single purpose entities spes and are secured by the assets of each spe  which consists of the real and personal property and intangible assets of a single community 
the debt is generally nonrecourse debt to the company in that only the assets or common stock of the spe are available to the lender in the event of default  with some limited exceptions 
these debt obligations do not contain provisions requiring ongoing maintenance of specific financial covenants but do contain typical events of default such as nonpayment of monetary obligations  failure to maintain insurance coverage  fraud and or misrepresentation of facts  unauthorized sale or transfer of assets  and the institution of legal proceedings under bankruptcy 
these debt instruments typically contain cross default provisions  which are limited to other related loans provided by the specific lender 
remedies under an event of default include the acceleration of payment of the related obligations 
mortgage debt financed primarily through traditional financial lending institutions of approximately million  or approximately of our total debt outstanding 
these obligations were incurred to facilitate community acquisitions over the past few years  were typically issued to and secured by the assets of each spe  which consist of the real and personal property and intangible assets of a single community 
the debt is generally recourse debt to the company in that not only are the assets or common stock of each spe available to the lender in the event of default  but the company has guaranteed performance of each spe s obligations under the mortgage 
these debt obligations generally contain provisions requiring ongoing maintenance of specific financial covenants  such as debt service coverage ratios  operating income yields  occupancy requirements  and or net operating income thresholds 
the company s guarantees generally contain requirements to maintain minimum cash and or net worth balances 
in addition  the mortgages contain other typical events of default such as nonpayment of monetary obligations  failure to maintain insurance coverage  fraud and or misrepresentation of facts  unauthorized sale or transfer of assets  and the institution of legal proceedings under bankruptcy 
these debt instruments may contain cross default provisions  but are limited to other loans provided by the specific lender 
remedies under an event of default include the acceleration of payment of the related obligations 

table of contents mezzanine debt financing in the amount of million provided by real estate investment trusts reits to facilitate community acquisitions  or approximately of our total debt outstanding 
these obligations are generally unsecured or are secured by mortgages on leasehold interests in community lease agreements between the specific reit and the company  and performance under the debt obligations is guaranteed by the company 
the company guaranty generally contains a requirement to maintain minimum cash and or net worth balances 
typical events of default under these obligations include nonpayment of monetary obligations  events of default under related lease agreements  and the commencement of legal proceedings under bankruptcy 
remedies under an event of default include the acceleration of payments of the related obligations 
as of december   we operated communities under long term lease arrangements  of which were leased from publicly traded reits 
of the leased properties  contain provisions requiring ongoing maintenance of specific financial covenants  such as rent coverage ratios 
other typical events of default under these leases include nonpayment of rents or other monetary obligations  events of default under related lease agreements  and the commencement of legal proceedings under bankruptcy 
remedies in these events of default vary but generally include the requirement to post a security deposit in specified amounts  acceleration of lease payments  and or the termination of the related lease agreements 
as of december   we were in violation of financial covenants in master lease agreements covering communities 
we obtained a waiver from the lessor through january  and  as such  are currently in compliance 
as required  we will test for compliance again on the next measurement date of march  significant accounting policies and use of estimates significant accounting policies are those that we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in our reporting materially different amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that our accounting policies regarding revenue recognition  investments in joint ventures  asset impairments  goodwill impairment  stock based compensation  leases  self insurance reserves  and income taxes are the most critical in understanding the judgments involved in our preparation of our financial statements 
those financial statements reflect our revisions to such estimates in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision became known 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note  description of the business  basis of presentation  and summary of significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition approximately   and of our community revenue in   and  respectively  were derived from governmental reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 
we record billings for services under third party payor programs net of contractual adjustments as determined by the specific program 
we accrue any retroactive adjustments when assessed  regardless of when the assessment is paid or withheld  even if we have not agreed to or are appealing the assessment 
we record subsequent positive or negative adjustments to these accrued amounts in net revenues when they become known 
nearly all of noc s revenues are derived from medicare 
home health services are reimbursed by medicare based on episodes of care 
under the medicare prospective payment system pps  an episode of care is defined as a length of care up to days per patient with multiple continuous episodes allowed 
billings per episode under pps vary based on the severity of the patient s condition and are subject to adjustment  both higher and lower  for changes in the patient s medical condition and certain other reasons 
at the inception of each episode of care  we submit a request for anticipated payment rap to medicare for or of the estimated pps reimbursement 
we estimate the net pps revenues to be earned during an episode of care based on the initial rap billing  historical 
table of contents trends and other known factors 
the net pps revenues are initially recognized as deferred net service revenues and subsequently amortized as net service revenues ratably over the estimated average length of episode 
at the end of each episode of care  a final billing is submitted to medicare and any changes between the initial rap and final billings are recorded as an adjustment to the allowance for contractual adjustments 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates may change in the near term 
the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations 
investments in joint ventures we have investments in joint ventures with equity interests ranging from to 
gaap requires that at the time we enter into a joint venture  we must determine whether the joint venture is a variable interest entity and  if so  whether we are the primary beneficiary and thus required to consolidate the entity 
in performing this analysis  we consider various factors such as the amount of our ownership interest  our voting rights  the extent of our power to direct matters that significantly impact the entity s activities  and our participating rights 
we must also reevaluate each joint venture s status quarterly or whenever there is a change in circumstances such an increase in the entity s activities  assets  or equity investments  among other things 
asset impairments when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we evaluate long lived assets for impairment 
we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss based on the asset s estimated fair value 
for community assets  the fair value of the assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on future revenues and operating costs  using internal projections 
for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  we determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of the investment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of individual assets inside the joint venture 
for our investments in marketable equity securities  we must make a judgment as to whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
for other assets  we use the valuation approach that is appropriate given the relevant facts and circumstances 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting asset useful lives 
further  our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
goodwill impairment we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill carrying values may exceed their fair values 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value  an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value 
in  we early adopted accounting standards update no 
 testing goodwill for impairment asu 
this revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing companies with the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a further impairment test is necessary 
as a result  we first assess a range of qualitative factors including  but not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for our 
table of contents products and services  regulatory and political developments  and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance when evaluating potential impairment for goodwill 
if  after completing such assessment  it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we proceed to a two step impairment test  whereby the first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered to not be impaired and the second step of the test is not performed 
the second step of the impairment test is performed when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  in which case the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
as of october  the date we elected as our annual goodwill impairment test  emeritus was comprised of a single reporting unit 
we performed our qualitative assessment as of october  and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its applicable carrying value 
accordingly  it was not necessary to perform the two step impairment test and no goodwill impairment was recognized in subsequently  we determined that effective as of december   emeritus is comprised of three operating segments and reporting units  which are i ancillary services  including noc  ii the communities acquired in the hcp transaction  and iii the legacy emeritus communities 
for financial reporting purposes  however  emeritus is comprised of one reporting segment  which is assisted living and related services 
for purposes of our october  goodwill assessment  we will allocate goodwill to each of the three segments 
our impairment loss assessment contains uncertainties because it requires us to apply judgment to estimate whether there has been a decline in the fair value of our company reporting unit  including estimating future cash flows  and if necessary  the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
as we periodically perform this assessment  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
stock based compensation we measure the fair value of stock awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the related service period 
for stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock awards expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
changes in our assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation  however  a change in our critical assumptions including volatility and expected term would not have a material impact for fiscal year the company s restricted stock awards vest only upon the achievement of performance targets 
gaap requires recognition of compensation cost only when achievement of performance conditions is considered probable 
consequently  our determination of the amount of stock compensation expense requires a significant level of judgment in estimating the probability of achievement of these performance targets 
additionally  we must make estimates regarding employee forfeitures in determining compensation expense 
subsequent changes in actual experience are monitored and estimates are updated as information is available 
leases we determine whether to account for our leases as operating  capital  or financing leases depending on the underlying terms 
as of december   we operated communities under long term leases with operating  capital  and financing lease obligations 
the determination of this classification under gaap is complex and in certain situations requires a significant level of judgment 
our classification criteria is based on estimates regarding 
table of contents the fair value of the leased communities  minimum lease payments  effective cost of funds  the economic life of the community  and certain other terms in the lease agreements 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks  including workers compensation  healthcare benefits  professional and general liability  property insurance  and director and officers liability insurance 
we are self insured for professional liability risk with respect to of the communities in our consolidated portfolio 
the other communities are insured with conventional indemnity policies 
the liability for self insured known claims and incurred but not yet reported claims was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses as of december   based on sensitivity testing of the various underlying actuarial assumptions  is approximately million to million 
the high end of the range reflects the potential for high severity losses 
communities not in the self insurance pool are insured under commercial policies that provide for deductibles for each claim ranging from  to  as a result  the company is  in effect  self insured for claims that are less than the deductibles 
the liability for known claims and incurred not yet reported claims was million and million as of december  and  with corresponding estimated amounts receivable from the insurance companies of million and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to the addition of the sunwest jv communities to our consolidated portfolio in the fourth quarter of we are self insured for workers compensation risk except in texas  washington  and ohio up to  per claim through a high deductible  collateralized insurance program 
the liability for self insured known claims and incurred but not yet reported claims was million and million at december  and  respectively  which is included in accrued employee compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses as of december   based on sensitivity testing of the various underlying actuarial assumptions  is approximately million to million 
for health insurance  we self insure each participant up to  per year above which a catastrophic insurance policy covers any additional costs 
the liability for self insured incurred but not yet reported claims is included in accrued employee compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
a change in the estimated liability at december  would have increased or decreased operated portfolio expenses during by approximately million 
we share any revisions to prior estimates with the communities participating in the insurance programs  including those that we manage for third parties  based on their proportionate share of any changes in estimates 
accordingly  the impact of changes in estimates on our consolidated income from operations would be less sensitive than the difference indicated above 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by emeritus are not discounted and we estimate them  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
for professional liability and workers compensation claims  we engage third party actuaries to assist us in estimating the related liabilities 
in doing so  we record liabilities for estimated losses for both known claims and incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates are based on historical paid and incurred losses and ultimate losses using several actuarial methods 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
changes in self insurance reserves are recorded as an increase or decrease to expense in the period that the determination is made 
in march  congress enacted healthcare reform legislation  referred to as the affordable care act aca  which we believe will increase our costs to provide healthcare benefits 
the specific provisions of the aca will be phased in over time through  unless modifying legislation is passed before some of the provisions become effective 
the aca did not have a material financial impact on our company in or although there are 
table of contents additional expenses that will be incurred in  we do not expect that the aca will result in a material increase in our operating expenses in however  we could see significant cost increases beginning in when certain provisions of the legislation are required to be implemented 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse 
we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 
we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and record a related liability 
we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or when more information becomes available 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation  the status of various income tax audits  and our particular facts and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates

impact of inflation inflation could affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on the senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
the monthly charges for the resident s unit and assisted living services are influenced by the location of the community and local competition 
our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
the near term slow growth economic outlook in the united states may impact our ability to raise prices 
in recent years  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial position  revenues  income from continuing operations or cash flows 
we do not expect inflation affecting the us dollar to materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the foreseeable future 
non gaap measures a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical financial position  results of operations  or cash flows but excludes or includes amounts that would not be excluded or included in most measures under gaap 

table of contents definition of adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss adjusted for the following items depreciation and amortization  interest income  interest expense  net equity earnings or losses for unconsolidated joint ventures  provision for income taxes  loss from discontinued operations  certain noncash revenues and expenses  and acquisition  development  and financing expenses 
we define adjusted ebitdar as adjusted ebitda plus community lease expense  net of amortization of above below market rents and deferred straight line rent 
management s use of adjusted ebitda ebitdar adjusted ebitda ebitdar are commonly used performance metrics in the senior living industry 
we use adjusted ebitda ebitdar to assess our overall financial and operating performance 
we believe these non gaap measures  as we have defined them  are useful in identifying trends in our financial performance because they exclude items that have little or no significance to our day to day operations 
these measures provide an assessment of controllable expenses and afford management the ability to make decisions  which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals  as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
these measures also provide indicators for management to determine if adjustments to current spending levels are needed 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar provide us with measures of financial performance  independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short term  such as depreciation and amortization  taxation  interest expense  and lease expense associated with our capital structure 
these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can influence in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar are some of the metrics used by senior management to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis and are used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance and value of the companies in our industry 
limitations of adjusted ebitda ebitdar adjusted ebitda ebitdar have limitations as analytical tools 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our losses to calculate adjusted ebitda ebitdar and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap net loss include the items excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda ebitdar generally represent income or expense items that may have a significant effect on our financial results  items determined to be non recurring in nature could  nevertheless  re occur in the future  and depreciation and amortization  while not directly affecting our current cash position  does represent wear and tear and or reduction in value of our properties 
if the cost to maintain our properties exceeds our expected routine capital expenditures  then this could affect our ability to attract and retain long term residents at our communities 
an investor or potential investor may find this important in evaluating our financial position and results of operations 
we use these non gaap measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 

table of contents adjusted ebitda ebitdar are not alternatives to net loss  loss from continuing operations  or cash flows provided by operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on adjusted ebitda ebitdar as substitutes for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of gaap net loss to adjusted ebitda ebitdar presented below  along with our consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  and statements of cash flows 
in addition  because adjusted ebitda ebitdar are not measures of financial performance under gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  these measures as presented may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

recurring routine capital expenditures include expenditures capitalized in accordance with gaap that are funded from cffo 
amounts excluded from recurring routine capital expenditures consist primarily of community acquisitions  including expenditures incurred in the months immediately following acquisition  new construction and expansions  computer hardware and software purchases  and purchases of vehicles 
management s use of cash from facility operations we use cffo to assess our overall liquidity and to determine levels of executive compensation 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords us the ability to make decisions that facilitate meeting our current financial and liquidity goals as well as to achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for us to determine if we need to make adjustments to our current spending decisions 
this metric measures our overall liquidity based on operational factors that we can influence in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
cffo is one of the metrics used by us and our board of directors i to review our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness including our credit facilities and long term leases  ii to assess our ability to make regular recurring routine capital expenditures to maintain and improve our communities on a period to period basis  iii for planning purposes  including preparation of our

limitations of cash from facility operations cffo has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of cash flows from operating activities 
cffo does not represent cash available for discretionary expenditures  since we may have mandatory debt service requirements or other non discretionary expenditures not reflected in the measure 
we believe cffo is useful to investors because it assists in their ability to meaningfully evaluate our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness  including our credit facilities and capital and financing leases  and our ability to make regular recurring routine capital expenditures to maintain and improve our communities 
cffo is not an alternative to cash flows provided by or used in operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on cffo as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of gaap net cash provided by operating activities to cffo  along with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
we also strongly urge you not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in addition  because cffo is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  the cffo measure as presented in this report may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the following table shows the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to cffo for the periods indicated in thousands three months ended year ended december  december  net cash provided by operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities  net contract buyout costs repayment of capital lease and financing obligations recurring capital expenditures distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures cash from facility operations transaction costs unusual income tax items self insurance reserve adjustments  prior years cash from facility operations  as adjusted contract buyout costs consist of payments for our purchase of rights related to communities included in a cash flow sharing agreement see note  related party agreements 
contract buyout costs are included in transaction costs in the consolidated statements of operations 
excludes distributions resulting from the hcp transaction  the sale of communities and refinancing of debt

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates due to our financing activities and changes in the availability of credit 

table of contents the table below provides information about our debt and capital lease and financing obligations  including weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of december  in thousands  except interest rates 
expected maturity year thereafter total fair value average interest rate long term debt capital lease obligations our results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our short term and long term borrowings 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate borrowings based on the monthly libor 
of this total variable rate debt  million varies with libor with no libor floors or ceilings 
for every change in the libor on this million in variable rate debt  interest expense will either increase or decrease by  as of december   the weighted average variable rate was in excess of libor on million of the variable rate debt  and the monthly and day libor was and  respectively 
in addition  we have variable rate debt of million that has libor floors at a weighted average floor of and a weighted average spread of  for a total weighted average rate of 
the libor floors effectively make this debt fixed rate debt as long as the monthly libor is less than the weighted average floor 
increases or decreases to the monthly libor do not change interest expense on this variable rate debt until the monthly libor rises above the floor and  conversely  interest expense does not decrease when the monthly libor falls below the floor 
this analysis does not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings or operating lease obligations that may occur subsequent to december  this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment  nor does it consider actions that we might be able to take with respect to our financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change 
in october  pursuant to the terms of a credit agreement related to the blackstone jv communities  we purchased an interest rate cap for million 
this contract effectively caps the libor on a notional amount of million at over the term of the loan 
the downturn in the united states housing market in triggered a constriction in the availability of credit that continued through this could impact our ability to borrow money or refinance existing obligations at acceptable rates of interest 
thus far  we have experienced no significant barriers to obtaining credit
