item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
the information in this section has been derived from the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto  which appear in item of this form k 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with these consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the business and financial information provided in this form k 
unless otherwise indicated  the financial information presented in this section reflects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of first financial northwest and its subsidiaries 
overview first savings bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of first financial northwest and  as such  comprises substantially all of the activity for first financial northwest 
first savings bank is a community based savings bank primarily serving king and to a lesser extent  pierce  snohomish and kitsap counties  washington through our full service banking office located in renton  washington 
first savings bank s business consists of attracting deposits from the public and utilizing these funds to originate one to four family residential  multifamily  commercial real estate  construction land development  business and consumer loans 
our current business strategy emphasizes one to four family residential  multifamily and commercial real estate lending 
over the last four years  the national residential lending market has experienced severe challenges as home values declined and loan delinquencies and foreclosure rates reached unprecedented levels 
during the residential lending market improved somewhat  especially late in the year  but remained at depressed levels 
nationally  at december   the delinquency rate for one to four family residential loans days or more delinquent was and the percentage of loans in foreclosure was according to the national delinquency survey published by the mortgage bankers association 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income 
first savings bank is liability sensitive  which means our liabilities reprice at a faster rate than our interest earning assets  the lower interest rate environment that we are currently experiencing has contributed to an improvement in our net interest rate spread 
during  our provision for loan losses totaled million  a decrease of million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in the provision during was attributable to the decline in the level of nonperforming and classified loans  improved delinquency rates  the decline in the level of charge offs and the decrease in the size of our loan portfolio 
we will continue to monitor our loan portfolio and make adjustments to our alll as we deem necessary 
our noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment  data processing  oreo related expenses  professional fees  regulatory assessments and other general and administrative expenses 
salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees  payroll taxes and expenses for retirement and other employee benefits 
occupancy and equipment expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment  consist primarily of real estate taxes  depreciation expenses  maintenance and costs of utilities 
oreo related expenses consist primarily of maintenance and costs of utilities for the oreo inventory  market valuation adjustments  build out expenses  gains and losses from oreo sales  legal fees  real estate taxes and insurance 
our noninterest expenses decreased  during the year ended december  as compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in regulatory assessment expenses and a  decrease in insurance and bond premiums 
both of these decreases were a result of the fdic and the dfi terminating the order and replacing it with the bank mou in march partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of million related to our proxy contest and related litigation expenses during the year ended december  business strategy our long term business strategy is to operate and grow first savings bank as a well capitalized and profitable community bank  offering one to four family residential  commercial and multifamily real estate  construction land development  consumer and business loans along with a diversified array of deposit and other products and services to individuals and businesses in our market areas 
we intend to accomplish this strategy by leveraging our established name and franchise  capital strength and mortgage production capability by capitalizing on our intimate knowledge of our local communities to serve the convenience and needs of customers  delivering a consistent and high quality level of professional service  offering competitive deposit rates and developing customer relationships to expand our core deposits  diversifying the deposit mix by growing lower cost deposits  attracting new customers and expanding our footprint in the geographical area we serve  managing our loan portfolio to minimize concentrations and diversify the types of loans within the portfolio  managing credit risk to minimize the risk of loss and interest rate risk to optimize our net interest margin  and improving profitability through disciplined pricing  expense control and balance sheet management  while continuing to provide excellent customer service 
during the fourth quarter of  management examined the components of the company total compensation expense  specifically the benefits portion 
also  during  as in previous years  the company examined peer group data with respect to compensation  and conducted a full market benchmark analysis which provided the basis for the development of job category grades and related pay range structure 
although the results of the peer group and benchmark analyses indicated that the company base salary pay structure was considered in line with our peer group  we determined that aggregate benefits were somewhat high 
in order to make our compensation expense consistent with the market  the following steps are being implemented during benefits associated with the company defined benefit pension plan will be frozen as of april   the accrual for paid time off pto for sick leave has been reduced by and a combined pto policy for both vacation and sick leave is being implemented  regular work hours per week have been increased from to hours  and all employees will be required to contribute toward their medical coverage premiums and toward dependent premiums 
in addition  the company is looking to restructure with the objective of reducing overall expenses 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have  or could have  a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets 
the following are our critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the alll must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for analyzing the alll consists of two components general and specific allowances 
the general allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans 
management considers factors such as charge off history  the prevailing economy  borrower s ability to repay  the regulatory environment  competition  geographic and loan type concentrations  policy and underwriting standards  nature and volume of the loan portfolio  management s experience level  our loan review and grading systems  the value of underlying collateral and the level of problem loans in assessing the alll 
the specific allowance component is created when management believes that the collectability of a specific loan has been impaired and a loss is probable 
the specific reserves are computed using current appraisals  listed sales prices and other available information less costs to complete  if any  and costs to sell the property 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions 
our audit committee approves the provision for loan losses on a quarterly basis and the board of directors ratifies the audit committees actions 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period earnings and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
we believe that the alll is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period requiring management to make assumptions about probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the impact of an unexpected large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
for additional information see item a 
risk factors if our allowance for loan losses is not adequate  we may be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations  in this form k 
valuation of oreo and foreclosed assets 
real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
fair value is generally determined by management based on a number of factors  including third party appraisals of fair value in an orderly sale 
accordingly  the valuation of oreo is subject to significant external and internal judgment 
if the carrying value of the loan at the date a property is transferred into oreo exceeds the fair value less estimated costs to sell  the excess is charged to the alll 
management periodically reviews oreo values to determine whether the property continues to be carried at the lower of its recorded book value or fair value  net of estimated costs to sell 
any further decreases in the value of oreo are considered valuation adjustments and are charged to noninterest expense in the consolidated income statements 
expenses from the maintenance and operations and any gains or losses from the sales of oreo are included in noninterest expense 
deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources  the most significant being a expenses  such as our charitable contribution to the first financial northwest foundation  that can be carried forward to be utilized against profits in future years  b expenses recognized in our financial statements but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs  and c write downs in the value of assets for financial statement purposes that are not deductible for tax purposes until the asset is sold or deemed worthless 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount which can be recognized in line with the relevant accounting standards 
the level of deferred tax asset recognition is influenced by management s assessment of our historic and future profitability profile 
at each balance sheet date  existing assessments are reviewed and  if necessary  revised to reflect changed circumstances 
in a situation where income is less than projected or recent losses have been incurred  the relevant accounting standards require convincing evidence that there will be sufficient future tax capacity 
for additional information regarding our deferred taxes  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item other than temporary impairments on the market value of investments 
declines in the fair value of any available for sale or held to maturity investment below their cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment to that of fair value 
a charge to earnings and an establishment of a new cost basis for the investment is made 
unrealized investment losses are evaluated at least quarterly to determine whether such declines should be considered other than temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition 
although these evaluations involve significant judgment  an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the investment security is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in interest rates and there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer 
an unrealized loss in the value of an equity security is generally considered temporary when the fair value of the security is below the carrying value primarily due to current market conditions and not deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer 
other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value of either a debt or an equity security is other than temporary include ratings by recognized rating agencies  the extent and duration of an unrealized loss position  actions of commercial banks or other lenders relative to the continued extension of credit facilities to the issuer of the security  the financial condition  capital strength and near term prospects of the issuer and recommendations of investment advisers or market analysts 
therefore  deterioration of market conditions could result in impairment losses recognized within the investment portfolio 
fair value 
fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item for additional information about the level of pricing transparency associated with financial instruments carried at fair value 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  general 
at december   total assets decreased million to million from billion at december  this decrease in total assets was primarily the result of reductions in interest bearing deposits of million  net loans receivable of million and oreo of million  partially offset by an increase of million in investments available for sale 
total liabilities decreased million to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to a decrease of million in deposits 
stockholders equity increased million to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to net income of million for the year and a million increase in additional paid in capital

funds received were utilized to increase the investment portfolio by million and to reduce our customer interest bearing deposits by million as part of our strategy to reduce our total assets  mainly cash  in light of the economic conditions that existed in the first half of reducing loan demand from creditworthy borrowers  and to reduce higher cost certificates of deposit 
net loans receivable decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  loan originations for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of million from the year ended december  the decline in our net loan portfolio was primarily the result of paydowns due to normal borrower activity and charge offs 
in addition  we have been continuing to work on resolving our problem loans through the foreclosure process  taking deeds in lieu of foreclosure  short sales and transferring the underlying collateral to oreo  which contributed to the decrease in the size of our loan portfolio over the past year 
loan originations increased primarily as a result of increased loan demand during the second half of and a renewed emphasis on loan originations by our staff  now that the performance of our loan portfolio has improved 
loan originations included million in one to four family residential  million in commercial real estate  million in multifamily and million in consumer loans 
we also originated million in construction land development and  in business loans 
loan repayments during were million and loans transferred to oreo totaled million 
our investments available for sale increased million  or to million at december  from million at december  during the year ended december   we sold million of investments 
gross proceeds from the sales were million with net gains of  during the year ended december   we purchased million of investments which included million of variable rate securities and million in fixed rate securities 
the purchases and sales of investments throughout were executed to improve our interest rate risk position  deploy excess liquidity into investments as there was weak demand for loans to creditworthy borrowers in our market area and to take advantage of gains in our securities portfolio 
our nonperforming loans decreased to million at december  from million at december  nonperforming loans as a percent of our total loan portfolio  net of lip  was and at december  and  respectively

foregone interest during the year ended december  relating to all nonperforming loans totaled million 
there were no lip related to nonperforming loans at december  compared to  at december  we foreclosed or accepted deeds in lieu of foreclosure on million of real estate during and million during we anticipate continued foreclosure activity in  however  at lower levels than in and the number of properties that have been transferred into oreo has decreased considerably compared to and the number of properties that we have sold has also declined 
during  we transferred properties into oreo  compared to properties during and properties during sales of oreo in totaled properties  as compared to properties in and properties in the decline in both the transfer of properties into oreo and the sale of oreo properties was a result of our efforts to identify the problem loans within our portfolio and take prompt appropriate actions to turn these nonperforming assets into performing assets 
management performs an impairment analysis on a loan when it determines it is probable that all contractual amounts of principal and interest will not be paid as scheduled 
the analysis usually occurs when a loan has been classified as substandard or placed on nonaccrual status 
if the market value less costs to sell market value  of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  impairment is recognized by establishing a specific reserve in the alll for the loan or by adjusting an existing reserve amount 
deposits 
during the year ended december   deposits decreased million to million as compared to million at december  the decrease in deposits was primarily the result of our strategy to utilize our excess liquidity  mainly cash  to reduce higher cost deposits by competing less aggressively on deposit interest rates 
in addition  we did not renew certificates of deposit from municipalities and other government related entities due to the higher cost of maintaining these accounts as a result of a change in state law 
public funds declined to million of which million were certificates of deposit at december  from million of which million were certificates of deposit at december  we experienced decreases in our certificates of deposit and money market accounts of million and million  respectively 
these decreases were slightly offset by increases in our now  statement savings and noninterest bearing accounts of million   and  respectively 
we did not have any brokered deposits at december  and advances 
we use advances from the fhlb as an alternative funding source to manage funding costs  reduce interest rate risk and to leverage our balance sheet 
total advances at december  were million  unchanged  as compared to december  in addition  in january  a million fhlb advance matured and was repaid and not replaced 
stockholders equity 
total stockholders equity increased million  or to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily the result of net income of million  generated during the year ended december  and million increase in additional paid in capital related to stock based compensation 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general 
net income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the prior year 
the million decrease in net income was primarily the result of a million decrease in net interest income before the provision for loan losses and a million decrease in noninterest income 
these decreases were partially offset by a million decrease in the provision for loan losses  a  decrease in noninterest expense and a million increase in federal income tax benefit 
net interest income 
net interest income in was million  a million or decrease from million in  as a result of the changes in interest income and interest expense as detailed below 
interest income 
total interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the following table compares detailed average interest earning asset balances  associated yields and resulting changes in interest and dividend income for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in interest and dividend income average balance yield average balance yield dollars in thousands loans receivable  net investments available for sale interest bearing deposits fhlb stock total interest earning assets the million decline in interest income for as compared to was primarily a result of the decline in the average balance of our loan portfolio 
the yield on average interest earning assets declined basis points to for the year ended december  from for  reflecting both the general decline in interest rates and the strategic shift in our investment portfolio to more lower yielding adjustable rate investments 
interest income from net loans receivable decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decline was due to the million decrease in the average loan balance to million as compared to the average loan balance in the decrease in loan interest income related to the size of our portfolio accounted for million of the reduction in loan interest income 
the yield on net loans receivable decreased to for the year ended december  from in  a decrease of basis points  or million 
the new loans being added to the portfolio are at much lower rates than the existing loans that are being paid off or transferred to oreo  resulting in an overall lower yield in the portfolio 
interest income from investments available for sale declined million  almost entirely due to the basis point decrease in the yield on average investments compared to as proceeds from maturing  higher yielding fixed rate investments were reinvested primarily in adjustable rate investments that are currently yielding relatively low market rates 
interest expense 
total interest expense for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from the prior year 
the following table details average balances  cost of funds and the resulting decrease in interest expense for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in interest expense average balance cost average balance cost dollars in thousands now accounts statement savings accounts money market accounts certificates of deposit advances from the fhlb total interest bearing liabilities total interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million or to million from million in the decline in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to was primarily a result of the decrease in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities which equated to a decrease in interest expense of million 
the average balance of certificates of deposit decreased million to million at december  from million at december   accounting for million of the decrease in interest expense 
our overall average cost of funds decreased to for from in the decline in the average cost of our certificates of deposit  which accounted for million of the million decline in total interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in the average rate paid on the certificates of deposit from in to in  due to new and renewing certificates of deposit priced at lower interest rates 
our interest rate spread for was as compared to in our net interest margin increased to in as compared to in provision for loan losses 
management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the alll must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for analyzing the alll consists of two components general and specific allowances 
the general allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans

the specific allowance component is created when management believes that the collectability of a specific loan  has been impaired and a loss is probable 
the specific reserves are computed using current appraisals  listed sales prices and other available information less costs to complete  if any  and costs to sell the property 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions 
the alll was million or of total loans outstanding  net of lip at december  as compared to million or of total loans outstanding  net of lip at december  the decline in the alll reflects the improvement in our overall asset quality as reflected by the decline in nonperforming and classified loans as well as a decline in the overall age of our loan portfolio as approximately of our total loan portfolio was originated in the last two years at approximately current real estate market values 
the value of real estate collateral for older loans that were replaced by these new loan originations typically had higher loan to value ratios utilizing current market values  resulting in a greater potential for loss and a need for a larger alll 
a provision for loan losses of million was recorded for the year ended december  the comparable provision for loan losses for the year ended december  totaled million 
as of december  nonperforming loans  net of lip  totaled million as compared to million at december  of our nonperforming loans  million related to the one to four family residential loan portfolio  million related to the multifamily loan portfolio  million related to the commercial real estate loan portfolio  million related to the construction land development loan portfolio  primarily located in whatcom county  and  related to consumer loans 
the decrease in the provision during was attributable to the decrease in the level of nonperforming and classified loans  the reductions of loan charge offs and the decrease in the size of our total loan portfolio 
we believe that we use the best information available to establish the alll  and that the alll as of december   was adequate to absorb the probable and inherent risks of loss in the loan portfolio at that date 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future  or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
future additions to the allowance may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions  the level of problem loans  business conditions  credit concentrations  increased loan balances  or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio 
in addition  the determination of the amount of our alll is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process  which may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination

these decreases were partially offset by proxy and related litigation expenses of million incurred during  net of a refund receivable from our directors and officers insurance 
there were no comparable expenses incurred during as part of our emphasis on reducing costs  in january  we decided to freeze our defined benefit pension plan  which is expected to reduce ongoing salaries and employee benefit expenses 
federal income tax expense 
there was a federal income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  these benefits were primarily due to a million deferred tax asset valuation allowance reversal 
we performed a complete evaluation of our deferred tax assets at december  in making the determination whether a deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized  we evaluate all available positive and negative evidence including the possibility of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial results 
a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is established to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
during  based on our evaluation  we partially reversed our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based upon our positive operating results for and at december   our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was million  reducing our net deferred tax asset to million 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance relates primarily to charitable contributions carryforward and the net capital loss on the sale of an investment 
the net deferred tax asset at december  represents the amount that we determined was more likely than not to be realized 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  general

we continued to execute our strategy implemented in  when we hired experienced professionals to form a special assets department whose primary focus was on the prompt and effective management of our troubled and nonperforming assets to expedite their disposition and minimize any losses 
this strategy changed our long standing practice of promoting builder partnering solutions  as opposed to that of bank directed solutions such as foreclosures  short sales and accepting deeds in lieu of foreclosure 
this approach resulted in first savings bank foreclosing or accepting deeds in lieu of foreclosure on million of real estate during and million during deposits

our board of directors has approved an asset liability management policy to guide management in maximizing interest rate spread by managing the differences in terms between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities while maintaining acceptable levels of liquidity  capital adequacy  interest rate sensitivity  credit risk and profitability 
the policy established an asset liability management committee comprised of certain members of senior management and the board of directors 
the committee s purpose is to communicate  coordinate and manage our asset liability position consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the asset liability management committee meets quarterly to review various areas including economic conditions  interest rate outlook  asset liability mix  interest rate risk sensitivity  current market opportunities to promote specific products  historical financial results  projected financial results  and capital position 
the committee also reviews current and projected liquidity needs 
as part of its procedures  the asset liability management committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential change in the market value of portfolio equity that is authorized by the board of directors 
our risk when interest rates change 
the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
our loans generally have longer maturities than our deposits 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
we have utilized the following strategies in our efforts to manage interest rate risk we have attempted  where possible  to extend the maturities of our deposits which typically fund our long term assets  we have invested in securities with relatively short average lives  generally less than eight years  and we have added adjustable rate securities to our investment portfolio 
how we measure the risk of interest rate changes 
we monitor our interest rate sensitivity on a quarterly basis to measure the change in net interest income as a percentage of net income in varying rate environments 
management uses various assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of our operations to changes in interest rates 
although management believes these assumptions are reasonable  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from these assumptions 
although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities lag behind changes in market interest rates 
non uniform changes and fluctuations in market interest rates across various maturities will also affect the results presented 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  a portion of our adjustable rate loans have interest rate floors below which the loan contractual interest rate may not adjust 
approximately of our total loans were comprised of adjustable rate loans at december  at that date  million  or  of these loans with a weighted average interest rate of were at their floor interest rate 
the inability of our loans to adjust downward can contribute to increased income in periods of declining interest rates 
also  when loans are at their floors  there is a further risk that our interest income may not increase as rapidly as our cost of funds during periods of increasing interest rates 
further  in the event of a significant change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
we consider all these factors in monitoring our interest rate exposure 
the assumptions we use are based upon a combination of proprietary and market data that reflect historical results and current market conditions 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  prepayments  deposit decay rates and the market value of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios 
we use market data to determine prepayments and maturities of loans  investments and borrowings and use our own assumptions on deposit decay rates except for time deposits 
time deposits are modeled to reprice to market rates upon their stated maturities 
we also assume that non maturity deposits can be maintained with rate adjustments not directly proportionate to the change in market interest rates  based upon our historical deposit decay rates which are substantially lower than market decay rates 
we have demonstrated in the past that the tiering structure of our deposit accounts during changing rate environments results in relatively lower volatility and less than market rate changes in our interest expense for deposits 
we tier our deposit accounts by balance and rate  whereby higher balances within an account earn higher rates of interest 
therefore  deposits that are not very rate sensitive generally  lower balance tiers are separated from deposits that are rate sensitive generally  higher balance tiers 
when interest rates rise  we do not have to raise interest rates proportionately on less rate sensitive accounts to retain these deposits 
these assumptions are based upon our analysis of our customer base  competitive factors and historical experience 
our income simulation model examines changes in net interest income in which interest rates were assumed to remain at their base level  gradually increase by  and basis points over a month period  or decline assuming a gradual basis point reduction in rates 
reductions of rates by and basis points were not reported due to the very low rate environment 
the current federal funds rate is making a and basis point decrease impossible 
the following table illustrates the change in our net interest income at december  that would occur in the event of a gradual change in interest rates equally across all maturities  with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
december  net interest income change basis point change in rates change base the following table illustrates the change in our net portfolio value npv at december  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates equally across all maturities  with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
basis point change in rates net portfolio value net portfolio as of portfolio value of assets market value of assets amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands base the current federal funds rate is  making a and basis point decline in rates impossible 
the net portfolio value is the difference between the present value of the discounted cash flows of assets and liabilities and represents the market value of the company s equity for any given interest rate scenario 
net portfolio value is useful for determining  on a market value basis  how equity changes in response to various interest rate scenarios 
large changes in net portfolio value reflect increased interest rate sensitivity and generally more volatile earnings streams 
the increase or decrease in the estimated net portfolio value at the indicated interest rates compared to the net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates 
net portfolio value divided by the market value of assets 
the increase or decrease in the net portfolio value divided by the market value of assets 
the market value of assets represents the value of assets under the various interest rate scenarios and reflects the sensitivity of those assets to interest rate changes 
when interest rates rise by  or basis points  our net interest income initially increases because a significant portion over of our interest earning assets are based on indices that adjust frequently to changes in market interest rates 
our interest earning assets are primarily fixed rate  intermediate term and long term loans  and to a lesser extent cash  investment securities and loans with yields based on market indexes 
an increasing percentage of our interest bearing liabilities are relatively short term deposits or fhlb borrowings 
deposits comprise the majority and their repricing is dependent upon management s response to increasing interest rates or  in the case of certificates of deposit  the contractual maturity of the deposit instrument 
when interest rates rise by  or basis points  our net portfolio value of equity declines 
the decrease is primarily due to the impact of increasing interest rates on our loan portfolio which loses value in rising rate environments because of its predominately long term  fixed rate nature 
typically during a rising interest rate environment  interest bearing deposits reprice more rapidly than our interest earning assets 
during  we began to change the composition of our investment securities portfolio by selling fixed rate investments and purchasing adjustable rate investment products 
this strategy had the benefit of increasing the sensitivity of our interest earning assets to changes in market interest rates 
when interest rates decline by basis points  our net interest income increases slightly because our loan portfolio is primarily fixed rate and does not reprice lower  while our maturing deposits will reprice lower 
both cash and nonmaturity deposits reprice immediately but offset each other 
a significant portion of our interest bearing liabilities are certificates of deposit  which will reprice over the next twelve months 
when interest rates decline by basis points  our net portfolio value of equity increases modestly 
the increase is primarily due to the fixed rate nature of our loan portfolio whose value appreciates in declining rate environments because the discounted present value increases as market rates decline 
the net interest income and net portfolio value tables presented above are predicated upon a stable balance sheet with no growth or change in asset or liability mix 
in addition  the net portfolio value is based upon the present value of discounted cash flows using our estimates of current replacement rates to discount the cash flows 
the effects of changes in interest rates in the net interest income table are based upon a cash flow simulation of our existing assets and liabilities and assuming that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
delinquency rates may change when interest rates change as a result of changes in the loan portfolio mix  underwriting conditions  loan terms or changes in economic conditions that have a delayed effect on the portfolio 
even if interest rates change in the designated amounts  there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as set forth above 
also  a change in us treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve would cause changes to the net portfolio value and net interest income other than those indicated above 
liquidity we are required to have enough cash flow in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation 
we maintain cash flows above the minimum level believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including potential deposit outflows 
on a daily basis  we review and update cash flow projections to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained 
our primary sources of funds are customer deposits  loan and investment repayments  maturing investment securities and advances from the fhlb 
these funds  together with equity  are used to make loans  acquire investment securities and other assets  and fund continuing operations 
while maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we believe that our current liquidity position  and our forecasted operating results are sufficient to fund all of our existing commitments 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments such as overnight deposits or agency or mortgage backed securities 
on a longer term basis  we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products as described in greater detail under item business lending activities 
at december   the total approved loan origination commitments outstanding amounted to million 
at the same date  the undisbursed portion of construction lip totaled million and unused lines of credit were million 
we use our sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments  to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals  to fund loan commitments and to maintain our portfolio of investment securities 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at december  totaled million 
management s policy is to maintain deposit rates at levels that are competitive with other local financial institutions  although recently we have been less aggressive in competing for certificates of deposit and public funds in order to reduce our cost of funds 
based on historical experience  we believe that a significant portion of maturing deposits will remain with first savings bank 
in addition  we had the ability at december  to borrow an additional million from the fhlb and million from an unused line of credit with another financial institution as funding sources to meet commitments and for liquidity purposes 
effective february   the fhlb increased our line of credit to of assets from of assets at december  see the consolidated statements of cash flows in item of this report for further details on our cash flow activities 
we measure our liquidity based on our ability to fund our assets and to meet liability obligations when they come due 
liquidity and funding risk occurs when funds cannot be raised at reasonable prices  or in a reasonable time frame  to meet our normal or unanticipated obligations 
we regularly monitor the mix between our assets and our liabilities to manage effectively our liquidity and funding requirements 
our primary source of funds is our deposits 
when deposits are not available to provide the funds for our assets  we use alternative funding sources 
these sources include  but are not limited to advances from the fhlb  wholesale funding  brokered deposits  federal funds purchased and dealer repurchase agreements  as well as other short term alternatives 
we may also liquidate assets to meet our funding needs 
on a monthly basis  we estimate our liquidity sources and needs for the next six months 
also  we determine funding concentrations and our need for sources of funds other than deposits 
this information is used by our asset liability management committee in forecasting funding needs and investing opportunities 
capital our total stockholders equity was million at december  consistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable financial organization we will actively seek to maintain a well capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards 
as of december   first savings bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
regulatory capital ratios for first savings bank were as follows as of december  total capital to risk weighted assets was as compared to the required under the bank mou  tier i capital to risk weighted assets was  and tier i capital to average assets was as compared to the required under the bank mou 
at december   first savings bank met the financial ratios to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory guidelines 
see item  business how we are regulated regulation and supervision of first savings bank capital requirements 
commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and the unused portions of lines of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
commitments to extend credit and lines of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by us until the instrument is exercised 
at december  and  we had no commitments to originate loans for sale 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit  is based on our credit evaluation of the customer 
the amount and type of collateral required varies  but may include real estate and income producing commercial properties 
the following table summarizes our outstanding commitments to originate loans  to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding lines of credit and to disburse funds related to our construction loans at december  amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed through one year after one through three years after three through five years after five years in thousands commitments to originate loans unused portion of lines of credit undisbursed portion of construction loans total commitments first financial northwest and its subsidiaries from time to time are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
there are currently no matters that in the opinion of management  would have a material adverse effect on first financial northwest s consolidated financial position  results of operation or liquidity 
among our contingent liabilities are exposures to limited recourse arrangements with respect to sales of whole loans and participation interests 
we anticipate that we will continue to have sufficient funds and alternative funding sources to meet our current commitments

impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturity structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation on earnings  as distinct from levels of interest rates  is in the area of noninterest expense 
expense items such as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation 
an additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
our management is unable to determine the extent  if any  to which properties securing loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation
