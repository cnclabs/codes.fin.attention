the improvement in working capital was driven principally by improved accounts receivable collections and inventory management  and an increase in accounts payable 
our margin accounts relating to commodity hedging contracts were relatively unchanged 
to manage price risk related to corn purchases in north america  we use derivative instruments corn futures and options contracts to lock in our corn costs associated with firm priced customer sales contracts 
we are unable to directly hedge price risk related to co product sales  however  we enter into hedges of soybean oil a competing product to our animal feed and corn oil in order to mitigate the price risk of animal feed and corn oil sales 
as the market price of corn fluctuates  our derivative instruments change in value and we fund any unrealized losses or receive cash for any unrealized gains related to outstanding corn futures and option contracts 
we plan to continue to use corn futures and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firm priced customer sales contracts in our north american business and accordingly  we will be required to make or be entitled to receive  cash deposits for margin calls depending on the movement in the market price for corn 
listed below are our primary investing and financing activities for sources uses of cash in millions capital expenditures payments on debt proceeds from borrowings dividends paid including dividends of to non controlling interests issuance of common stock repurchases of common stock on september   we sold million of percent senior notes due september  the notes

on december   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock 
this dividend was paid on january  to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  we currently anticipate that capital expenditures for will be in the range of million to million 
we currently expect that our future cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our anticipated capital expenditures  dividends  and other investing and or financing strategies for the foreseeable future 
we have not provided federal and state income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because these earnings are planned to be permanently reinvested 
approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents as of december  is held by our operations outside of the united states 
we expect that available cash balances and credit facilities in the united states  along with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for the foreseeable future 
it is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings 
we do not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to the united states to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business  including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements 

table of contents hedging we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions  authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities 
these transactions utilize exchange traded derivatives or over the counter derivatives with investment grade counterparties 
our hedging transactions may include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments such as commodity futures  options and swap contracts  forward currency contracts and options  interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
commodity price risk we use derivatives to manage price risk related to purchases of corn and natural gas used in the manufacturing process 
we periodically enter into futures  options and swap contracts for a portion of our anticipated corn and natural gas usage  generally over the following twelve to eighteen months  in order to hedge price risk associated with fluctuations in market prices 
these derivative instruments are recognized at fair value and have effectively reduced our exposure to changes in market prices for these commodities 
we are unable to directly hedge price risk related to co product sales 
unrealized gains and losses associated with marking our commodities based derivative instruments to market are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income oci 
at december   our accumulated other comprehensive loss account aoci included million of losses  net of tax of million  related to these derivative instruments 
it is anticipated that approximately million of these losses  net of tax of million  will be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months 
we expect the losses to be offset by changes in the underlying commodities cost 
foreign currency exchange risk due to our global operations  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result  we have exposure to translational foreign exchange risk when our foreign operation results are translated to us dollars usd and to transactional foreign exchange risk when transactions not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit are revalued 
we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts  swaps and options to selectively hedge our foreign currency transactional exposures 
we generally hedge these exposures up to twelve months forward 
at december   we had million of foreign currency forward sales contracts and million of foreign currency forward purchase contracts that hedged transactional exposures 
the fair value of these derivative instruments was approximately million at december  interest rate risk we occasionally use interest rate swaps and treasury lock agreements t locks from time to time to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes  to reduce the volatility of our financing costs  or to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating rate debt  based on current and projected market conditions 
at december   we did not have any t locks outstanding 
we have interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert the interest rate on our percent million senior notes due november  to a variable rate 
these swap agreements call for us to receive interest at a fixed rate percent and to pay interest at a variable rate based on the six month us dollar libor rate plus a spread 
we have designated these interest rate swap agreements as hedges of the changes in fair value of the underlying debt obligation attributable to changes in interest rates and account for them as fair value hedges 
the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements approximated million at december  and is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet within non current assets  with an offsetting amount recorded in long term debt to adjust the carrying amount of the hedged debt obligation 
at december   our accumulated other comprehensive loss account included million of losses net of tax of million related to settled treasury lock agreements 
these deferred losses are being amortized to financing costs

pursuant to the terms of the agreement  comgas supplies natural gas to the cogeneration facility at ingredion brazil s mogi guacu plant 
this agreement will expire on march   unless extended or terminated under certain conditions specified in the agreement 
during the term of the agreement  ingredion brazil is obligated to purchase from comgas  and comgas is obligated to provide to ingredion brazil  certain minimum quantities of natural gas that are specified in the agreement 
the price for such quantities of natural gas is determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the agreement 
the price may vary based upon gas commodity cost and transportation costs  which are adjusted annually  the distribution margin which is set by the brazilian commission of public energy services  and the fluctuation of exchange rates between the us dollar and the brazilian real 
we estimate that the total minimum expenditures by ingredion brazil through the remaining term of the agreement will be approximately million based on current exchange rates as of december  and estimates regarding the application of the formula set forth in the agreement  spread evenly over the remaining term of the agreement

table of contents key financial performance metrics we use certain key financial metrics to monitor our progress towards achieving our long term strategic business objectives 
these metrics relate to our return on capital employed  our financial leverage  and our management of working capital  each of which is tracked on an ongoing basis 
we assess whether we are achieving an adequate return on invested capital by measuring our return on capital employed roce against our cost of capital 
we monitor our financial leverage by regularly reviewing our ratio of net debt to adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization net debt to adjusted ebitda and our net debt to capitalization percentage to assure that we are properly financed 
we assess our level of working capital investment by evaluating our operating working capital as a percentage of net sales 
we believe these metrics provide valuable managerial information to help us run our business and is useful to investors 
the metrics below include certain information including capital employed  adjusted operating income  adjusted ebitda  net debt  adjusted current assets  adjusted current liabilities and operating working capital that is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
management uses non gaap financial measures internally for strategic decision making  forecasting future results and evaluating current performance 
by disclosing non gaap financial measures  management intends to provide a more meaningful  consistent comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with our gaap results  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business 
these non gaap measures should be considered as a supplement to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

at december   we had achieved our established targets 
however  no assurance can be given that we will continue to meet our financial performance metric targets 
see item a risk factors and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objectives set out below reflect our current 
table of contents aspirations in light of our present plans and existing circumstances 
we may change these objectives from time to time in the future to address new opportunities or changing circumstances as appropriate to meet our long term needs and those of our shareholders 
return on capital employed our long term goal is to achieve a return on capital employed roce in excess of percent 
in determining this performance metric  the negative cumulative translation adjustment is added back to total equity to calculate returns based on the company s original investment costs 
our roce for grew to percent from percent in  as our adjusted operating income growth more than offset a higher capital employed base 
our effective income tax rate for  excluding the impact of the reversal of the korea deferred tax asset valuation allowance  restructuring charges and integration costs  was percent  down from percent in  excluding the impact of the nafta award  integration costs and restructuring charges 
net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio our long term objective is to maintain a ratio of net debt to adjusted ebitda of less than 
driven by our strong earnings growth  this ratio declined to at december   from at december  net debt to capitalization percentage our long term goal is to maintain a net debt to capitalization percentage in the range of to percent 
at december   our net debt to capitalization percentage was percent  down from percent a year ago  primarily reflecting a percent reduction in total net debt and a higher capital base driven by our earnings growth 
operating working capital as a percentage of net sales our long term goal is to maintain operating working capital in a range of to percent of our net sales 
at december   the metric was percent  down from the percent of a year ago 
the decrease in the metric reflects our sales growth and improved working capital position 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified below the most critical accounting policies upon which the financial statements are based and that involve our most complex and subjective decisions and assessments 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with members of the audit committee of our board of directors 
these accounting policies are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion that follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
long lived assets we have substantial investments in property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets 
for property  plant and equipment  we recognize the cost of depreciable assets in operations over the estimated useful life of the assets and evaluate the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for definite lived intangible assets  we recognize the cost of these amortizable assets in operations over their estimated useful life and evaluate the recoverability of the assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 

table of contents in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets  we may have to make projections regarding future cash flows 
in developing these projections  we make a variety of important assumptions and estimates that have a significant impact on our assessments of whether the carrying values of property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets should be adjusted to reflect impairment 
among these are assumptions and estimates about the future growth and profitability of the related business unit  anticipated future economic  regulatory and political conditions in the business unit s market  the appropriate discount rates relative to the risk profile of the unit or assets being evaluated and estimates of terminal or disposal values 
in  we decided to restructure our business operations in kenya and close our manufacturing plant in the country 
as part of that decision  we recorded a million restructuring charge  which included fixed asset impairment charges of million to write down the carrying amount of certain assets to their estimated fair values 
as part of our ongoing strategic optimization  in the third quarter of  we decided to exit our investment in shouguang golden far east modified starch co  ltd gfems  a non wholly owned consolidated subsidiary in china 
in conjunction with that decision  we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of gfems to its estimated net realizable value 
we also recorded a million charge for impaired assets in colombia in the third quarter of in addition  as part of a manufacturing optimization program developed in conjunction with the acquisition of national starch to improve profitability  we completed a plan in october that will optimize our production capabilities at certain of our north american facilities 
as a result  we recorded restructuring charges to write off certain equipment by the plan completion date 
for the year ended december   we recorded charges of million of which million represented accelerated depreciation on the equipment 
through our continual assessment to optimize our operations  we address whether there is a need for additional consolidation of manufacturing facilities or to redeploy assets to areas where we can expect to achieve a higher return on our investment 
this review may result in the closing or selling of certain of our manufacturing facilities 
the closing or selling of any of the facilities could have a significant negative impact on the results of operations in the year that the closing or selling of a facility occurs 
even though it was determined that there was no additional long lived asset impairment as of december   the future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate that would require a change in our assumptions or strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions  could require us to perform tests of recoverability in the future 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets our methodology for allocating the purchase price of acquisitions is based on established valuation techniques that reflect the consideration of a number of factors  including valuations performed by third party appraisers when appropriate 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value assigned to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we have identified several reporting units for which cash flows are determinable and to which goodwill may be allocated 
goodwill is either assigned to a specific reporting unit or allocated between reporting units based on the relative excess fair value of each reporting unit 
in addition  we have certain indefinite lived intangible assets in the form of trade names and trademarks  the majority of which were acquired through the national starch acquisition in the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  was million and million  respectively 
we perform our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests annually as of october  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 

table of contents in performing our annual impairment test for goodwill as of october  management made certain estimates and judgments  including the identification of reporting units and determination of fair values for each reporting unit  which management estimates using both discounted cash flow analysis and an analysis of market multiples 
significant assumptions used in the determination of fair value for each reporting unit include estimates for discount and long term net sales growth rates  in addition to operating and capital expenditure requirements 
we considered significant changes in discount rates for each reporting unit based on current market interest rates and specific risk factors within each geographic region 
we also evaluated qualitative factors  such as legal  regulatory  or competitive forces  in estimating the impact to the fair value of each reporting unit noting no significant changes that would result in any reporting unit failing the step one impairment test 
changes in assumptions concerning projected results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting units in the future 
based on the results of our assessment as of october   we concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of all reporting units was greater than their carrying value 
in performing the qualitative annual impairment assessment for indefinite lived intangible assets  we considered various factors in determining if it was more likely than not that the fair value of these indefinite lived intangible assets was greater than their carrying value 
we evaluated net sales attributable to these intangible assets as compared to original projections and evaluated future projections of net sales related to these assets 
in addition  we considered market and industry conditions in the reporting units in which these intangible assets are allocated noting no significant changes that would result in a failed step one 
based on the results of this qualitative assessment as of october   we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of these indefinite lived intangible assets was greater than their carrying value 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method recognizes the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and provides a valuation allowance when deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
at december   we maintain valuation allowances of million against approximately million of foreign operating loss carryforwards  million of state loss carryforwards and million of us capital loss carryforward that management has determined will more likely than not expire prior to realization 
during  valuation allowances were reduced from million to million 
the december  valuation allowance on our korean subsidiary of million was reversed because we consider it more likely than not the net deferred tax assets are realizable 
in addition  we have impaired virtually all the assets of our kenyan subsidiary and ceased conducting business in the ordinary course 
because the net deferred tax assets no longer exist  the million valuation allowance reported in december  has also been reversed 
the remaining million of change consists of the capital loss and other immaterial amounts 
we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities  and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe there is uncertainty with respect to certain positions and we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit 
we evaluate these unrecognized tax benefits and related reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest and penalties in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of realizing tax benefits  such as the settlement of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable 
however  final determinations of prior year tax liabilities  either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations  could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and 
table of contents liabilities and historical income tax provisions 
the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 
no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested 
if future events  including changes in tax law  material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply  which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 
retirement benefits we sponsor non contributory defined benefit plans covering substantially all employees in the united states and canada  and certain employees in other foreign countries 
we also provide healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees in the united states  canada  and brazil 
in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these benefits  our management must make a variety of estimates and assumptions including discount rates  expected long term rates of return  rate of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates  and other factors 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis as of december or more frequently if a significant event requiring remeasurement occurs and modify our assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is appropriate to do so 
the effects of modifications are recognized immediately on the balance sheet  but are generally amortized into operating earnings over future periods  with the deferred amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we believe the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable and based on experience  market conditions  and input from our actuaries 
we use third party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions and estimates  as well as to appropriately measure the costs and obligations associated with our retirement benefit plans 
had we used different estimates and assumptions with respect to these plans  our retirement benefit obligations and related expense could vary from the actual amounts recorded  and such differences could be material 
additionally  adverse changes in investment returns earned on pension assets and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities or changes in required funding levels may have an unfavorable impact on future expense and cash flow 
net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost for all of our plans was million in and million in we determine our assumption for the discount rate used to measure year end pension and postretirement obligations based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of the expected benefit payments  which has been benchmarked using a long term  high quality aa corporate bond index 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine our obligations under us pension plans for december  and were percent and percent  respectively 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine our obligations under non us pension plans for december  and were percent and percent  respectively 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine our obligations under our postretirement plans for december  and were percent and percent  respectively 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rates at december  would have increased the accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation by the following amounts millions us pension plans accumulated benefit obligation projected benefit obligation non us pension plans accumulated benefit obligation projected benefit obligation postretirement plans accumulated benefit obligation 
table of contents the company s investment policy for its pension plans is to balance risk and return through diversified portfolios of passively managed equity index instruments  fixed income index securities  and short term investments 
maturities for fixed income securities are managed such that sufficient liquidity exists to meet near term benefit payment obligations 
the asset allocation is reviewed regularly and portfolio investments are rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
we have assumed an expected long term rate of return on assets of percent for us plans and percent for canadian plans 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption on plan assets  which consist mainly of us and canadian equity and debt securities  management evaluated historical rates of return achieved on plan assets and the asset allocation of the plans  input from our independent actuaries and investment consultants  and historical trends in long term inflation rates 
projected return estimates made by such consultants are based upon broad equity and bond indices 
we also maintain several funded pension plans in other international locations 
the expected returns on plan assets are determined based on each plan s investment approach and asset allocations 
health care cost trend rates are used in valuing our postretirement benefit obligations and are established based upon actual health care cost trends and consultation with actuaries and benefit providers 
at december   the health care trend rate assumption for the us  canada and brazil plans were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the sensitivities of service cost and interest cost and year end benefit obligations to changes in health care trend rates for the postretirement benefit plans as of december  are as follows one percentage point increase in trend rates increase in service cost and interest cost components million increase in year end benefit obligations million one percentage point decrease in trend rates decrease in service cost and interest cost components million decrease in year end benefit obligations million see also note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information related to our benefit plans

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt and price risk on our fixed rate date 
as of december   approximately percent or billion of our borrowings are fixed rate debt and the remaining percent or approximately billion of our debt is subject to changes in short term rates  which could affect our interest costs 
we assess market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential change in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical percentage point change in interest rates at december  a hypothetical increase of percentage point in the weighted average floating interest rate would increase our interest expense by approximately million 
see also note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled financing arrangements for further information 
at december  and  the carrying and fair values of long term debt were as follows in millions carrying amount fair value carrying amount fair value senior notes  due november  senior notes  due november  senior notes  due september  senior notes  due april  senior notes  due april  senior notes  due march  us revolving credit facility  due october  fair value adjustment related to hedged fixed rate debt total long term debt a hypothetical change of percentage point in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt at december  by approximately million 
since we have no current plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments before their maturities  the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long term debt is not expected to have an affect on our consolidated financial statements 
in anticipation of our issuance of the million percent senior notes due november  the notes and the million percent senior notes due november  the notes  we entered into t lock agreements with respect to million of the notes and million of the notes the t locks 
the t locks were designated as hedges of the variability in cash flows associated with future interest payments caused by market fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate between the time the t locks were entered into and the time the debt was priced 
the t locks are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the t locks were terminated on september  and we paid approximately million  representing the losses on the t locks  to settle the agreements 
the losses are included in aoci and are being amortized to financing costs over the terms of the and notes 
on march   we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert the interest rate on our notes to a variable rate 
these swap agreements call for us to receive interest at a fixed rate percent and to pay interest at a variable rate based on the six month us dollar libor rate plus a spread 
we have designated these interest rate swap agreements as hedges of the changes in fair value of the underlying debt obligation attributable to changes in interest rates and account for them as fair value hedges 
the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements approximated million at december  and is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet within non current assets  with an offsetting amount recorded in long term debt to adjust the carrying amount of the hedged debt obligation 
raw material and energy costs 
our finished products are made primarily from corn 
in north america  we sell a large portion of finished products at firm prices established in supply contracts typically lasting for periods of up to one year 
in order to minimize the effect of volatility in the cost of corn related to these firm priced supply contracts  we enter into corn futures contracts  or take other hedging positions in the corn futures market 
these contracts typically 
table of contents mature within one year 
at expiration  we settle the derivative contracts at a net amount equal to the difference between the then current price of corn and the futures contract price 
while these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  changes in the value of the underlying exposures we are hedging generally offset such fluctuations 
while the corn futures contracts or other hedging positions are intended to minimize the volatility of corn costs on operating profits  occasionally the hedging activity can result in losses  some of which may be material 
outside of north america  sales of finished products under long term  firm priced supply contracts are not material 
energy costs represent approximately percent of our operating costs 
the primary use of energy is to create steam in the production process and to dry product 
we consume coal  natural gas  electricity  wood and fuel oil to generate energy 
the market prices for these commodities vary depending on supply and demand  world economies and other factors 
we purchase these commodities based on our anticipated usage and the future outlook for these costs 
we cannot assure that we will be able to purchase these commodities at prices that we can adequately pass on to customers to sustain or increase profitability 
we use derivative financial instruments  such as over the counter natural gas swaps  to hedge portions of our natural gas costs  primarily in our north american operations 
our commodity price hedging instruments generally relate to contracted firm priced business 
at december   we had outstanding futures and option contracts that hedged approximately million bushels of forecasted corn purchases 
also at december   we had outstanding swap and option contracts that hedged approximately million mmbtu s of forecasted natural gas purchases 
based on our overall commodity hedge position at december   a hypothetical percent decline in market prices applied to the fair value of the instruments would result in a charge to other comprehensive income of approximately million  net of income tax benefit 
it should be noted that any change in the fair value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be substantially offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
foreign currencies 
due to our global operations  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result  we have exposure to translational foreign exchange risk when our foreign operation results are translated to usd and to transactional foreign exchange risk when transactions not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit are revalued 
we selectively use derivative instruments such as forward contracts  currency swaps and options to manage transactional foreign exchange risk 
based on our overall foreign currency transactional exposure at december   a hypothetical percent decline in the value of the usd would have resulted in a transactional foreign exchange gain of approximately million 
at december   our accumulated other comprehensive loss account included in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet includes a cumulative translation loss of million 
the aggregate net assets of our foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency approximated billion at december  a hypothetical percent decline in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would have resulted in a reduction to our cumulative translation loss and a credit to other comprehensive income of approximately million
