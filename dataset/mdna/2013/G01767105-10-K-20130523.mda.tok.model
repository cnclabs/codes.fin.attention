overview we develop medicines that address the unmet needs and challenges of people living with chronic diseases 
a fully integrated global biopharmaceutical company  we apply proven scientific expertise  proprietary technologies and global development capabilities to the creation of innovative treatments for major clinical conditions with a focus on cns disorders  such as schizophrenia  addiction and depression 
we create new  proprietary pharmaceutical products for our own account  and we collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we are increasingly focused on maintaining rights to commercialize our leading product candidates in certain markets 
on september   the business of alkermes  inc and edt were combined under the business combination in a transaction accounted for as a reverse acquisition with alkermes  inc treated as the accounting acquirer 
as a result  the operating results of the acquiree  edt  are included only after the date of acquisition  september  prior to september   the operating results are that of alkermes  inc for a more detailed discussion of the business combination  refer to note  the company  and note  acquisitions  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended march  executive summary we and our pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners have more than commercialized products sold worldwide  including in the us we earn manufacturing and or royalty revenues on net sales of products commercialized by our partners and earn revenue on net sales of vivitrol  which is a proprietary product that we manufacture  market and sell in the us our five key products are expected to generate significant revenues for us in the near and medium term  as they possess long patent lives  are singular or competitively advantaged products in their class and are generally in the launch phases of their commercial lives 
these five key products are risperdal consta and invega sustenna xeplion  ampyra fampyra  bydureon  and vivitrol 
for the year ended march   we reported million in revenues which represented an increase of over the year ended march  revenues from our five key products accounted for of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended march  for the year ended march   total operating expenses increased by million  as compared to the year ended march   due primarily to the addition of a full twelve months of activity from the former edt business 
in september  we entered into an amendment the refinancing to the first lien term loan pursuant to which the first lien term loan was amended and restated to  among other things  provide for a new tranche of term loans in an amount equal to million  the proceeds of which  together with cash on hand of approximately million  were used to repay in full all monies due pursuant to the second lien term loan 
the new term loan facility includes the term loans and each of the term loans included a libor floor of in february  we further amended the term loans the repricing to secure i a reduction in interest payable under term loan b to libor plus and a decrease in the 
table of contents libor floor to  ii a reduction in interest payable under term loan b to libor plus and a decrease in the libor floor to  and c a shortened time period  from one year to six months  during which a refinancing of our term loans  as described in the amended and restated credit agreement  would trigger a prepayment premium 
in connection with the refinancing and repricing  we incurred a charge of million  which was recorded within interest expense  and we expect to save approximately million in contractual cash interest expense through the remaining life of the term loans 
results of operations manufacturing and royalty revenues manufacturing revenues are earned from the sale of products under arrangements with our collaborators when product is shipped to them at an agreed upon price 
royalties are earned on our collaborators sales of products that incorporate our technologies 
royalties are generally recognized in the period the products are sold by our collaborators 
the following table compares manufacturing and royalty revenues earned in the years ended march   and years ended march  change favorable unfavorable in millions manufacturing and royalty revenues risperdal consta invega sustenna xeplion ampyra fampyra ritalin la focalin xr tricor verelan bydureon other manufacturing and royalty revenues our long acting  antipsychotic franchise consists of risperdal consta and invega sustenna xeplion 
under our risperdal consta supply and license agreements with janssen  we earn manufacturing revenues at of janssen unit net sales price of risperdal consta and royalty revenues at 
under our invega sustenna xeplion agreement with janssen  we earn royalties on end market sales of invega sustenna xeplion of up to the first million in calendar year sales  on calendar year sales of between million and million  and on calendar year sales exceeding million 
the royalty rate resets at the beginning of each calendar year to 
the decrease in risperdal consta manufacturing and royalty revenues for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to a decrease in the number of units shipped to janssen and a decrease in royalties 
the decrease in royalties was due to a decrease in janssen end market sales of risperdal consta from  million during the year ended march  to  million during the year ended march  the increase in risperdal consta manufacturing and royalty revenues for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to an increase in the number of units shipped to janssen and a increase in royalties 
the increase in royalties was due to an increase in janssen end market sales of risperdal consta from  million during the year ended march  to  million during the year ended march  
table of contents the increase in royalty revenues from invega sustenna xeplion in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was due to having a full twelve months of invega sustenna xeplion royalties in the year ended march  and an increase in end market sales of the product 
janssen end market sales of invega sustenna xeplion in the years ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
in the year ended march   we earned a royalty from janssen for sales made during the period of september   the closing date of the business combination  through march  we expect revenues from our long acting atypical antipsychotic franchise to continue to grow  as invega sustenna xeplion is launched around the world 
a number of companies  including us  are working to develop products to treat schizophrenia and or bipolar disorder that may compete with risperdal consta and invega sustenna xeplion 
increased competition may lead to reduced unit sales of risperdal consta and invega sustenna xeplion  as well as increasing pricing pressure 
risperdal consta is covered by a patent until in the eu and in the us  and invega sustenna xeplion is covered by a patent until in the eu and in the us  and as such  we do not anticipate any generic versions in the near term for either of these products 
the increase in royalty revenues from ampyra fampyra was due to having a full twelve months of ampyra fampyra royalties in the year ended march   an increase in demand for ampyra in the us and an increase in the number of countries in which fampyra is sold 
acorda end market sales of ampyra fampyra in the year ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
in the year ended march   we earned a royalty from acorda for sales made during the period of september   the closing date of the business combination  through march  we expect ampyra fampyra sales to continue to grow as acorda continues to penetrate the us market with ampyra and biogen idec continues to launch fampyra in the rest of the world 
ampyra is covered by a patent until in the us and fampyra is covered by a patent until in the eu  and as such  we do not anticipate any generic versions of these products in the near term 
a number of companies are working to develop products to treat multiple sclerosis that may compete with ampyra fampyra  which may negatively impact future sales of the products 
the increase in royalty revenues from ritalin la focalin xr  tricor  and verelan and the other manufacturing and royalty revenues were primarily due to the addition of the portfolio of commercialized products from the former edt business 
included in other manufacturing and royalty revenues is million related to the exercise of an option to license certain of our intellectual property that is not used in our key clinical development programs or commercial products 
a number of our mature products  including ritalin la and verelan currently face generic competition 
in november  a generic version of tricor was introduced to the market  and as a result  we have seen a reduction in the sales of tricor a generic version of certain doses of focalin xr is expected to occur at any time 
as a result of these generic entries  we expect sales of these products to decline over the next few fiscal years 
certain of our manufacturing and royalty revenues are earned in countries outside of the us and are denominated in currencies in which the product is sold

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information on currency exchange rate risk related to our revenues 
product sales  net our product sales  net consist of sales of vivitrol in the us to wholesalers  specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies 
the following table presents the adjustments to arrive at 
table of contents vivitrol product sales  net for sales of vivitrol in the us during the years ended march   and year ended march  year ended march  year ended march  in millions amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales product sales  gross adjustments to product sales  gross medicaid rebates chargebacks product returns co pay assistance other total adjustments product sales  net prior to august   product returns was a reserve for inventory in the channel  an estimate to defer the recognition of revenue on shipments of vivitrol to our customers until the product left the distribution channel as we did not have the history to reasonably estimate returns related to these shipments 
beginning on august   we changed the method of revenue recognition to recognize revenue upon delivery to our customers and provide for a reserve for future returns 
this change in the method of revenue recognition resulted in a one time million increase to product sales  net  which was recognized during the three months ended september  the increase in product sales  gross for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was due to a increase in the number of units sold 
the increase in product sales  gross for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to a increase in the number of units sold into the distribution channel and a increase in price 
the increases in medicaid rebates and chargebacks during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the increase in vivitrol sales during the period 
the increases in chargebacks during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the increase in the price of vivitrol and increased b phs pricing discounts 
we expect vivitrol sales  net to continue to grow as we continue to penetrate the opioid dependence indication market in the us in addition  we anticipate that janssen cilag will increase sales of vivitrol in russia and the cis  which are recorded as manufacturing and royalty revenues  and there exists the potential to launch the product in other countries around the world 
a number of companies  including us  are working to develop products to treat addiction  including alcohol and opioid dependence that may compete with vivitrol  which may negatively impact future sales of vivitrol 
increased competition may lead to reduced unit sales of vivitrol  as well as increasing pricing pressure 
vivitrol is covered by a patent that will expire in the us in and in europe in and  as such  we do not anticipate any generic versions of this product in the near term 
research and development revenue years ended march  change favorable unfavorable in millions research and development revenue 
table of contents research and development r d revenue is generally earned for services performed and milestones achieved under arrangements with our collaborators 
the decrease in r d revenue for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to million in bydureon milestone payments we received during the year ended march  under our agreement with amylin  we received a million milestone payment related to the first commercial sale of bydureon in the eu in july and a million milestone payment related to the first commercial sale of bydureon in the us in february during the year ended march   we also received a million milestone payment upon receipt of regulatory approval for vivitrol in russia for the opioid dependence indication 
costs and expenses cost of goods manufactured and sold years ended march  change favorable unfavorable in millions cost of goods manufactured and sold the increase in cost of goods manufactured and sold in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to an increase of million in cost of goods manufactured from the edt portfolio of commercialized products and a million increase in vivitrol cost of goods manufactured and sold  partially offset by a million decrease in risperdal consta cost of goods manufactured 
the increase in cost of goods manufactured from the edt portfolio of commercialized products is primarily due to having a full twelve months of cost of goods manufactured expense in the year ended march  the increase in vivitrol cost of goods manufactured and sold is due to a increase in the amount of vivitrol sold in the us and shipped to russia for resale by cilag 
the decrease in risperdal consta cost of goods manufactured is due to a decrease in the amount of risperdal consta shipped to janssen 
the increase in cost of goods manufactured and sold in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the addition of million of cost of goods manufactured from the addition of edt portfolio of commercialized products and a million increase in vivitrol cost of goods manufactured and sold primarily due to an increase in the number of vivitrol units sold 
research and development expenses for each of our r d programs  we incur both external and internal expenses 
external r d expenses include costs related to clinical and non clinical activities performed by contract research organizations  consulting fees  laboratory services  purchases of drug product materials and third party manufacturing development costs 
internal r d expenses include employee related expenses  occupancy costs  depreciation and general overhead 
we track external r d expenses for each of our development programs  however  internal r d expenses are not tracked by individual program as they benefit multiple programs or our technologies in general 

table of contents the following table sets forth our external r d expenses relating to our individual key development programs and all other development programs  and our internal r d expenses by the nature of such expenses years ended march  change favorable unfavorable in millions external r d expenses key development programs aripiprazole lauroxil alks alks alks other development programs total external expenses internal r d expenses employee related occupancy depreciation other total internal r d expenses research and development expenses these amounts are not necessarily predictive of future r d expenditures 
in an effort to allocate our spending most effectively  we continually evaluate the products under development  based on the performance of such products in preclinical and or clinical trials  our expectations regarding the likelihood of their regulatory approval and our view of their commercial viability  among other factors 
the increase in r d expenses related to the aripiprazole lauroxil program in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the continuation of the phase study  initiated in december  to assess the efficacy  safety and tolerability of aripiprazole lauroxil in approximately patients experiencing acute exacerbation of schizophrenia 
the increase in r d expenses related to the alks program in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the phase study of alks  initiated in january  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alks in approximately patients with mdd 
the results of this phase study were announced in april the decrease in r d expenses related to the alks program in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was due to the decision in may not to advance alks after the results from the phase b multicenter  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  repeat dose study did not satisfy our pre specified criteria for advancing into phase clinical trials 
the increase in r d expenses related to the aripiprazole lauroxil program in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to increased work leading up to and the initiation of the phase study in december the increase in r d expenses related to the alks program in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to increased work leading up to and the initiation of two phase b studies of alks  which began in july and october the increase in total internal r d expenses in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   and for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   are primarily due to the addition of the former edt business in september 
table of contents we expect an increase in r d expenses in the year ended march  primarily due to increased r d investment as certain of our key development programs  most notably alks and alks  continue to advance through the pipeline and as aripiprazole lauroxil nears completion of its phase clinical trial 
selling  general and administrative expenses years ended march  change favorable unfavorable in millions selling  general and administrative the decrease in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to a million decrease in professional service expense  partially offset by an million increase in employee related expenses 
the decrease in professional service expense was primarily due to million of costs incurred in connection with the business combination during the year ended march  the increase in employee related expense was primarily due to having a full twelve months of employee related expenses from the former edt business as well as an increase in share based compensation expense due in part to the increase in the number of eligible participants in our equity plans as a result of the business combination  and the fact that recent equity grants have been awarded with higher grant date fair values than older grants due to the increase in our stock price 
the increase in sg a costs for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to an increase of million in professional service expenses  million in employee related expenses and million in marketing expense from the alkermes  inc  business  as well as the addition of million of sg a expense for the former edt business 
the increase in professional services was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the business combination 
the increase in employee related expenses was primarily due to an increase in headcount and share based compensation expense as recent equity grants have been awarded with higher grant date fair values than older grants  and the increase in marketing expenses was due to an analysis we performed to determine the marketability of our existing products and product candidates 
amortization of acquired intangible assets years ended march  change favorable unfavorable in millions amortization of acquired intangible assets the intangible assets being amortized in the year ended march  and were acquired as part of the business combination 
in connection with the business combination  we acquired certain amortizable intangible assets with a fair value of million  which are expected to be amortized over to years 
we amortize our amortizable intangible assets using the economic use method  which reflects the pattern that the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed as revenue is generated from the underlying patent or contract 
based on our most recent analysis  amortization of intangible assets included within our consolidated balance sheet at march  is expected to be approximately million  million  million  million and million in the fiscal years ending march  through  respectively 
we also acquired million of goodwill in connection with the business combination  which is considered an indefinite lived asset and is not amortized  but is subject to an annual review for 
table of contents impairment or when circumstances indicate the fair value may be below its carrying value 
our goodwill solely relates to  and has been assigned to  a reporting unit which consists of the former edt business 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the three months ended december  and determined that the fair value of the former edt business reporting unit was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value and there was no impairment in the value of this asset 
restructuring years ended march  change favorable unfavorable in millions restructuring on april   we approved a restructuring plan related to our athlone  ireland manufacturing facility consistent with the evolution of our product portfolio and designed to improve operational performance in the future 
under the restructuring plan  we will terminate manufacturing services for certain older products becoming uneconomic to produce due to decreasing demand from its customers resulting from generic competition 
we expect to continue to generate revenues from the manufacturing of these products during fiscal year and  for certain of these products  into fiscal year as a result of the termination of these services  we expect to implement a corresponding reduction in headcount of up to employees 
the restructuring plan commenced immediately and will be implemented over a period of approximately two years 
this restructuring plan is expected to result in estimated annual cost savings of between million to million by fiscal year and beyond 
in conjunction with the restructuring plan  we recorded a one time restructuring charge  expected to be settled in cash payments  related to severance and other employee related expenses of million in the year ended march   as we determined that an obligation had been incurred  it was probable that the obligation would be paid and the amount of the obligation could be reasonably estimated 
the total amount of the restructuring charges is accrued at march  as part of the restructuring plan  we also expect to incur non cash charges resulting from the accelerated depreciation of certain manufacturing assets  currently estimated to be approximately million and million in the years ended march  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets years ended march  change favorable unfavorable in millions impairment of long lived assets during the three months ended march   we performed an impairment analysis on certain of our manufacturing equipment dedicated to the production of vivitrol 
we determined that the manufacturing space previously assigned to vivitrol will be used for the scale up of the aripiprazole lauroxil manufacturing line 
as such  certain equipment  originally purchased by cephalon in connection with our vivitrol collaboration and later acquired by us upon the termination of the vivitrol collaboration  was determined to have no future use 
we recorded an impairment charge of million which represents the net carrying value of the equipment less the proceeds received upon the sale of certain of this equipment 

table of contents during the year ended march   and after finalization of the purchase accounting for the business combination  we identified events and changes in circumstances  such as correspondence from regulatory authorities and further clinical trial results related to three product candidates  including megestrol for use in europe  acquired as part of the business combination which indicated that the assets may be impaired 
accordingly  we performed an analysis to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
we performed the valuation of the ipr d from the viewpoint of a market participant through the use of a discounted cash flow model 
the model contained certain key assumptions including the cost to bring the products through the clinical trial and regulatory approval process  the gross margin a market participant would likely earn if the product were approved for sale  the cost to sell the approved product  and a discount factor based on an industry average weighted average cost of capital 
based on the analysis performed  we determined that the ipr d was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million 
other expense  net years ended march  change favorable unfavorable in millions interest income interest expense other income expense  net total other expense  net the increase in interest expense for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   is primarily due to the refinancing and repricing transactions 
the refinancing and repricing transactions were considered a restructuring of our term loans and involved multiple lenders who were considered a part of a loan syndicate 
for accounting purposes  certain of the debt restructuring was treated either as an extinguishment or modification of the term loans 
the treatment of the debt restructuring and the million charge to interest expense in connection with the refinancing and repricing is as follows in millions september refinancing february repricing total extinguished debt unamortized deferred financing costs unamortized original issue discount modified debt debt financing costs original issue discount prepayment penalty total the increase in interest expense for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to our entry into million of term loan financing in july the term loans became effective upon the closing of the business combination in september included in interest expense during the year ended march  are commitment fees of million which were incurred during the period from when we priced the term loans  effective july   to when the term loans were funded in september 
table of contents provision for income taxes years ended march  change favorable unfavorable in millions income tax expense benefit our income tax expense for the year ended march  consists of a current income tax provision of million and a deferred income tax benefit of million 
the current income tax provision is primarily due to us federal and state taxes of million and million respectively on income earned in the us  and foreign withholding taxes of million 
the deferred income tax benefit is primarily due to a benefit of million in ireland as a result of the reversals of deferred tax liabilities for intangible assets for which the book basis exceeds the tax basis 
the intangible assets are being amortized for book purposes over the life of the assets 
our effective tax rate is  which is higher than the irish statutory tax rate of due to a number of factors  including income taxable at a rate higher than the irish statutory rate  losses in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is currently available and various expenses not deductible for income tax purposes 
our income tax benefit for the year ended march  consists of a current income tax provision of million and a deferred income tax benefit of million 
the current income tax provision is primarily due to a provision of million on the taxable transfer of the bydureon intellectual property from the us to ireland 
the deferred tax benefit is primarily due to a benefit of million from the partial release of the irish deferred tax liability relating to acquired intellectual property that was established in connection with the business combination and a benefit of million due to the partial release of an existing us federal valuation allowance as a consequence of the business combination 
in connection with the business combination  we were incorporated  and are headquartered  in dublin  ireland 
as a result  our statutory tax rate decreased from in the us to in ireland 
as of march   we had million of irish net operating loss nol carryforwards  million of us federal nol carryforwards and million of state nol carryforwards which either expire on various dates through or can be carried forward indefinitely 
these loss carryforwards are available to reduce certain future irish and us taxable income  if any 
these loss carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the appropriate taxing authorities 
these loss carryforwards  which may be utilized in any future period  may be subject to limitations based upon changes in the ownership of our stock 
we have performed a review of ownership changes in accordance with the us internal revenue code and have determined that it is more likely than not that  as a result of the business combination  we have experienced a change of ownership 
as a consequence  our us federal nol carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of million 
at march  we determined  based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence  on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized  and a valuation allowance has been recorded 
however  if we demonstrate consistent profitability in the future  the evaluation of the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets could change and the valuation allowance could be released in whole or in part

this was partially offset by a decrease in cash from working capital  most notably from a decrease in cash from accounts receivable of million and a decrease in cash from deferred revenue of million 
cash used by operating activities decreased in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   which was primarily due to a decrease in cash used in net income of million and million of payments made in connection with the early redemption of our non recourse notes during the year ended march  this was partially offset by changes in working capital  most notably from a decrease in cash provided by receivables of million and an increase in cash used to purchase inventory  prepaid expenses and other assets of million

the increase in cash flows provided by investing activities in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the million of cash we paid to acquire edt and a million increase in cash used to acquire property  plant and equipment  partially offset by a million increase in the net sales of investments 
we expect to spend approximately million during the nine months ended december  for capital expenditures 
amounts included as construction in progress in the consolidated balance sheets primarily include capital expenditures at our manufacturing facility in ohio 
we continue to evaluate our manufacturing capacity based on expectations of demand for our products and will continue to record such amounts within construction in progress until such time as the underlying assets are placed into service  or we determine we have sufficient existing capacity and the assets are no longer required  at which time we would recognize an impairment charge 
we continue to periodically evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these long lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
financing activities the increase in cash flows used in financing activities in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the million of cash received upon the issuance of the term loans in september during the year ended march   we used million of cash in the refinancing attributable to financing activities  and million of cash for principal payments on our long term debt  which was offset by a million increase in cash received from our employees upon the exercise of stock awards

we have the intent and ability to hold these investments until recovery  which may be at maturity  and it is more likely than not that we would not be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost 
at march   we performed an analysis of our investments with unrealized losses for impairment and determined that they are temporarily impaired 
at march  and  none and  respectively  of our investments are valued using unobservable  or level inputs  to determine fair value as they are not actively trading and fair values could not be derived from quoted market prices

at march   we have million of net liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions and we expect a net reduction in the amount of the million due to the expected resolution of certain matters over the next months 
in september  we entered into a license agreement with the rensselaer polytechnic institute rpi which granted us exclusive rights to a family of opioid receptor compounds discovered at rpi 
under the terms of the agreement  rpi granted us an exclusive worldwide license to certain patents and patent applications relating to its compounds designed to modulate opioid receptors

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit and risk committee of our board of directors 
manufacturing and royalty revenue our manufacturing and royalty revenues are earned under the terms of collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical companies  the most significant of which include janssen for risperdal consta and invega sustenna xeplion  acorda for ampyra fampyra and bristol myers for bydureon 
manufacturing revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title to the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the sales price for certain of our manufacturing revenues is based on the end market sales price earned by our collaborative partners 
as the end market sale occurs after we have shipped our product and the risk of loss has passed to our collaborative partner  we estimate the sales price for our product based on information supplied to us by our collaborative partners  our historical transaction experience and other third party data 
differences between the actual manufacturing revenues and estimated manufacturing revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period in which they become known  which is generally the following quarter 

table of contents royalty revenues are related to the sale of products by our collaborative partners that incorporate our technologies 
royalties are earned under the terms of a license agreement in the period the products are sold by our collaborative partner  and the royalty earned can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales information is provided to us by our collaborative partners and may require estimates to be made 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period in which they become known  which is generally the following quarter 
product sales  net we recognize revenue from product sales of vivitrol when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and title to the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we sell vivitrol to pharmaceutical wholesalers  specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies 
vivitrol product sales are recorded net of sales reserves and allowances 
sales of many pharmaceutical products in the us are subject to increased pricing pressure from managed care groups  institutions  government agencies and other groups seeking discounts 
we and other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies selling products in the us market are required to provide statutorily defined rebates and discounts to various us government and state agencies in order to participate in the medicaid program and other government funded programs 
the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program and type of customer 
estimates associated with medicaid and other us government allowances may become subject to adjustment in a subsequent period 
we record vivitrol product sales net of the following significant categories of product sales allowances medicaid rebates we record accruals for rebates to states under the medicaid drug rebate program as a reduction of sales when the product is shipped into the distribution channel 
we rebate individual states for all eligible units purchased under the medicaid program based on a rebate per unit calculation  which is based on our average manufacturer price amp 
we estimate expected unit sales and rebates per unit under the medicaid program and adjust our rebate estimates based on actual unit sales and rebates per unit 
to date  actual medicaid rebates have not differed materially from our estimates  chargebacks wholesaler and specialty pharmacy chargebacks are discounts that occur when contracted customers purchase directly from an intermediary wholesale purchaser 
contracted customers  which consist primarily of federal government agencies purchasing under the fss  generally purchase the product at its contracted price  plus a mark up from the wholesaler 
the wholesaler  in turn  charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contracted price paid to the wholesaler by the customer 
the allowance for wholesaler chargebacks is based on actual and expected utilization of these programs 
wholesaler chargebacks could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future participation in these programs 
to date  actual wholesaler chargebacks have not differed materially from our estimates  product returns we record an estimate for product returns at the time our customer takes title to our product 
we estimate the liability based on our historical return levels and specifically identified anticipated returns due to known business conditions and product expiry dates 
once vivitrol is returned  it is destroyed 
at march   our product return reserve rate is estimated to be approximately of our product sales 
prior to august  we deferred the recognition of revenue on shipments of vivitrol to our customers until the product left the distribution channel as we did not have sufficient history to reasonably estimate returns related to vivitrol shipments 
we estimated product shipments out of the distribution channel through data provided by external sources  including 
table of contents information on inventory levels provided by our customers in the distribution channel  as well as prescription information 
in order to match the cost of goods related to products shipped to customers with the associated revenue  we deferred the recognition of the cost of goods to the period in which the associated revenue is recognized  co pay assistance we have a program whereby a patient can receive up to per month towards their co payment  co insurance or deductible  provided the patient meets certain eligibility criteria 
reserves are recorded upon the sale of vivitrol

in addition  we hold strategic equity investments  which include the common stock of public companies we have or had a collaborative arrangement with 
substantially all of our investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at their estimated fair value 
the valuation of our available for sale securities for purposes of determining the amount of gains and losses is based on the specific identification method 
our held to maturity investments are restricted investments held as collateral under certain letters of credit related to our lease arrangements and are recorded at amortized cost 
the earnings on our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates  credit ratings  collateral value  the overall strength of credit markets and other factors that may result in other than temporary declines in the value of the securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review the fair market value of our investments in comparison to amortized cost 
if the fair market value of a security is less than its carrying value  we perform an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the 
table of contents amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary  and the full amount of the unrealized loss is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security 
for equity securities  when assessing whether a decline in fair value below our cost basis is other than temporary  we consider the fair market value of the security  the duration of the security decline and the financial condition of the issuer 
we then consider our intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient to recover our carrying value 
where we have determined that we lack the intent and ability to hold an equity security to its expected recovery  the security decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
we classify our financial assets and liabilities as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
fair values determined by level inputs are based on a market approach using quoted prices obtained from brokers or dealers for similar securities or for securities for which we have limited visibility into their trading volumes 
valuations of these financial instruments do not require a significant degree of judgment 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 
our level investments are valued using discounted cash flow models that include assumptions such as estimates for interest rates  the timing of cash flows  expected holding periods and risk adjusted discount rates  which include provisions for default and liquidity risk 
we also consider assumptions market participants would use in their estimate of fair value  such as collateral underlying the securities  the creditworthiness of the issuers  associated guarantees  bid and ask prices and callability features 
while we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate  the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on our results of operations 
share based compensation we have a share based compensation plan  which includes incentive stock options  non qualified stock options and restricted stock units 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  share based compensation in our notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our share based compensation plans 
the fair value of restricted stock units is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock option awards is determined through the use of a black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the expected option term  which takes into account both the contractual term of the option and the effect of our employees expected exercise and post vesting termination behavior  expected volatility of our ordinary shares over the option expected term  which is developed using both the historical volatility of our ordinary shares and implied volatility from our publicly traded options  the risk free interest rate over the option expected term  and an expected annual dividend yield 
due to the differing exercise and post vesting termination behavior of our employees and non employee directors  we establish separate black scholes input assumptions for three distinct employee populations our senior management  our non employee directors  and all other employees 

table of contents for the year ended march   and  the ranges in weighted average assumptions were as follows year ended march  expected option term years years years expected stock volatility risk free interest rate expected annual dividend yield in addition to the above  we apply judgment in developing estimates of award forfeitures 
for the year ended march   we used an estimated forfeiture rate of zero for our non employee directors  for members of senior management and for all other employees 
for all of the assumptions used in valuing stock options and estimating award forfeitures  our historical experience is generally the starting point for developing our assumptions  which may be modified to reflect information available at the time of grant that would indicate that the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past 
amortization and impairment of long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill  which is separately tested for impairment  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset carrying value exceeds the asset estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset 
when reviewing long lived assets for impairment  we group long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
our amortizable intangible assets include technology and collaborative arrangements that were acquired as part of the business combination 
these intangible assets are being amortized as revenue is generated from these products  which we refer to as the economic benefit amortization model 
this amortization methodology involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset 
an analysis of the anticipated product sales generated from our amortizable intangible assets is performed at least annually during our planning cycle  and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic benefit amortization model 
we amortize our amortizable intangible assets using the economic use method  which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed 
in order to determine the pattern in which the economic benefits of our intangible assets are consumed  we estimated the future revenues to be earned under our collaboration agreements and our nanocrystal and ocr technology based intangible assets from the date of acquisition to the end of their respective useful 
table of contents lives 
the factors used to estimate such future revenues include i our and our collaborative partners projected future sales of the existing commercial products based on these intangible assets  ii our projected future sales of new products based on these intangible assets which we anticipate will be launched commercially  iii the patent lives of the technologies underlying such existing and new products  and iv our expectations regarding the entry of generic and or other competing products into the markets for such existing and new products 
these factors involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control and could cause the actual economic benefits of these intangible assets to be materially different from our estimates 
we allocate the value of our intangible assets to match the expected revenue pattern 
based on our most recent analysis  amortization of intangible assets included within our consolidated balance sheet at march   is expected to be approximately million  million  million  million and million in the fiscal years ending march  through  respectively 
although we believe such available information and assumptions are reasonable  given the inherent risks and uncertainties underlying our expectations regarding such future revenues  there is the potential for our actual results to vary significantly from such expectations 
if revenues are projected to change  the related amortization of the intangible asset will change in proportion to the change in revenue 
if there are any indications that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis would be different than those utilized within our current estimates  our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of the products associated with our amortizable intangible assets 
for example  the occurrence of an adverse event could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense associated with our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations  which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually in the quarter ended december  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the goodwill for each reporting unit is tested using a two step process 
a reporting unit is an operating segment  as defined by the segment reporting accounting standards  or a component of an operating segment 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and is reviewed by management 
two or more components of an operating segment may be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes if the components have similar economic characteristics 
as of december   we have one operating segment and two reporting units 
our goodwill  which solely relates to the edt acquisition in the fiscal year ended march   has been assigned to one reporting unit which consists of the former edt business 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying value  which includes goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  the goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying value is higher than the fair value  there is an indication that an impairment may exist and the second step is required 
in step two  the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
we worked with a third party valuation firm and established fair value for the purpose of impairment testing by using an average of the income approach and the market approach 
the income approach employs a discounted cash flow model that takes into account i assumptions that market 
table of contents participants would use in their estimates of fair value  ii current period actual results  and iii budgeted results for future periods that have been vetted by senior management 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates the same fundamental pricing concepts used to calculate fair value in an acquisition due diligence process and a discount rate that takes into consideration our estimated cost of capital adjusted for the uncertainty inherent in an acquisition 
the market approach employs market multiples for comparable publicly traded companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries obtained from industry sources  taking into consideration the nature  scope and size of the acquired reporting unit 
in the market approach  estimates of fair value are established using an average of both revenue and ebitda multiples  adjusted for the reporting unit performance relative to peer companies 
we determined that the fair value of the former edt business reporting unit was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value and there was no impairment in the value of this asset as of december  a decline in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in goodwill impairment  and a related non cash impairment charge against earnings  if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit  including its goodwill 
a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations relating to our goodwill impairment assessment  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the estimated fair value of the former edt business reporting unit and we determined that a decrease in fair value of at least would be required before this reporting unit would have a carrying value in excess of its fair value 
acquisitions purchase price allocation in accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation as necessary  up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset values and liabilities assumed 
our intangible assets consist primarily of collaboration agreements and technology associated with human therapeutic products that we acquired as part of the business combination 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  we engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
if these projects are not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected product sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such products  will transpire as estimated 

table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
our most significant tax jurisdictions are the irish and us federal governments and states 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on management interpretations of jurisdiction specific tax laws or regulations and the likelihood of settlement related to tax audit issues 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective income tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in estimates of prior years items  likelihood of settlement  and changes in overall levels of income before taxes 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative income in the most recent fiscal years  changes in the business in which we operate and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
at march   we determined  based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence  on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized  and a valuation allowance has been recorded 
however  if we demonstrate consistent profitability in the future  the evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset could change and the valuation allowance could be released in part or in whole 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions 
our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process 
we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures  including all appeals and administrative reviews  we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position  and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position 
we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we hold securities in our investment portfolio that are sensitive to market risks 
our securities with fixed interest rates may have their market value adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to a fall in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value 
table of contents due to changes in interest rates 
however  because we classify our investments in debt securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
should interest rates fluctuate by  our interest income would change by an immaterial amount over an annual period 
due to the conservative nature of our short term and long term investments and our investment policy  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk as our investment policies specify credit quality standards for our investments and limit the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we do not believe that inflation and changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations  and as over of our investments are in debt securities issued by the us government  our exposure to liquidity and credit risk is not believed to be significant 
in accordance with the terms of the term loans  we entered into two interest rate cap agreements and an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate the interest rate risk on million principal amount of the term loans  however  in connection with the refinancing  there is no longer a requirement that we enter into such instruments to mitigate our interest rate risk 
at march   an interest rate cap and an interest rate swap agreement have yet to mature and remain outstanding 
the interest rate cap  with a notional amount of million  protects us if three month libor were to reach from the date of issuance through december  the interest rate swap protects us if three month libor were to reach from december  through september  term loan b bears interest at three month libor plus with a libor floor of 
as the three month libor rate was at march   and the libor floor under term loan b is  and as our interest rate cap and swap fixes our interest rate at for million principal amount and for million principal amount  respectively  we do not expect changes in the three month libor to have a material effect on our financial statements through march  term loan b bears interest at one month libor plus with no libor floor 
at march   the one month libor rate was 
a increase in the one month libor rate would increase our interest expense in the year ended march  by an immaterial amount 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
the counterparties to our interest rate cap and interest rate swap contracts are multinational commercial banks 
we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is remote 
currency exchange rate risk manufacturing and royalty revenues we receive on certain of our significant products  including risperdal consta  xeplion  fampyra  tricor  bydureon  focalin xr and ritalin la are a percentage of the net sales made by our collaborative partners 
a significant portion of these sales are made in countries outside the us and are denominated in currencies in which the product is sold  which is predominantly the euro 
the manufacturing and royalty payments on these non us sales are calculated initially in the currency in which the sale is made and are then converted into usd to determine the amount that our partners pay us for manufacturing and royalty revenues 
fluctuations in the exchange ratio of the usd and these non us currencies will have the effect of increasing or decreasing our manufacturing and royalty revenues even if there is a constant amount of sales in non us currencies 
for example  if the usd weakens against a non us currency  then our manufacturing and royalty revenues will increase given a constant amount of sales in such non us currency 
for the year ended march   an average strengthening of the usd relative to the currencies in which these products are sold would have resulted in our manufacturing and royalty revenues being reduced by approximately million 

table of contents as a result of the business combination  we incur substantial operating costs in ireland 
we face exposure to changes in the exchange ratio of the usd and the euro arising from expenses and payables at our irish operations that are settled in euro 
the impact of changes in the exchange ratio of the usd and the euro on our usd denominated manufacturing and royalty revenues earned in countries other than the us is partially offset by the opposite impact of changes in the exchange ratio of the usd and the euro on operating expenses and payables incurred at our irish operations that are settled in euro 
for the fiscal year ended march   an average weakening in the usd relative to the euro would have resulted in an increase to our expenses denominated in euro of million
