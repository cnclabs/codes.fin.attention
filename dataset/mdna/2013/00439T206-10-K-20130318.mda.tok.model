general overview we are one of the largest and most diversified manufacturers and suppliers of commercial vehicle components in north america 
our products include commercial vehicle wheels  wheel end components and assemblies  truck body and chassis parts  and ductile and gray iron castings 
we market our products under some of the most recognized brand names in the industry  including accuride  gunite  imperial  and brillion 
we serve the leading oems and their related aftermarket channels in most major segments of the commercial vehicle market  including heavy and medium duty trucks  commercial trailers  light trucks  buses  as well as specialty and military vehicles 
our primary product lines are standard equipment used by a majority of north american heavy and medium duty truck oems  which creates a significant barrier to entry 
we believe that substantially all heavy duty truck models manufactured in north america contain one or more accuride components 
our diversified customer base includes substantially all of the leading commercial vehicle oems  such as daimler truck north america  llc  with its freightliner and western star brand trucks  paccar  with its peterbilt and kenworth brand trucks  navistar  with its international brand trucks  and volvo mack  with its volvo and mack brand trucks 
our primary commercial trailer customers include leading commercial trailer oems  such as great dane limited partnership and utility trailer manufacturing company 
our major light truck customer is general motors corporation 
our product portfolio is supported by strong sales  marketing and design engineering capabilities and is manufactured in strategically located  technologically advanced facilities across the united states  mexico and canada 
key economic factors on our cost structure are raw material costs and production levels 
higher production levels enable us to spread costs that are more fixed in nature over a greater number of commercial vehicle products 
we use the commercial vehicle production levels forecasted by industry experts to help us predict our production levels along with other assumptions for aftermarket demand 
raw material costs represent the most significant component of our product cost and are driven by a combination of purchase contracts and spot market purchases as discussed in item raw materials and suppliers and elsewhere in this report 
business outlook global market and economic conditions have been challenging with slow economic growth in most major economies expected to continue into as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide credit to businesses and consumers 
these factors have lead to a decrease in spending by businesses and consumers alike 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and prolonged declines in business and consumer spending may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers  including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 

table of contents the heavy and medium duty truck and commercial trailer markets and the related aftermarket are the primary drivers of our sales 
these markets are  in turn  directly influenced by conditions in the north american truck industry and generally by conditions in other industries which indirectly impact the truck industry  such as the home building industry  and by overall economic growth and consumer spending 
industry forecasts predicted similar commercial vehicle production in as compared to however  the actual rate of production for the first half of was significantly greater than production in the final half of this decrease in production in the second half of was due to continued softness in orders for class commercial vehicles 
as a result of this softness  oems began to reduce build rates in the third and fourth quarters  often with very short notice to us  creating manufacturing inefficiencies 
furthermore  our gunite business experienced a loss of oem market share  which impacted our operating results in the second half of in addition  broader economic weaknesses in industrial manufacturing impacted our brillion business through reduced customer orders 
based upon the overall commercial vehicle industry production rates for the fourth quarter and the loss of market share at gunite  our results from continuing operations in were unfavorable compared to in response to these conditions  we lowered our cost structure by reducing our corporate salaried staff  eliminating production shifts  and resizing the workforce at our business units 
additionally  we accelerated the consolidation of gunite s elkhart  indiana and brillion  wisconsin machining operations into our rockford  illinois facility 
commercial vehicle equipment orders are expected to remain subdued into the first half of followed by improving industry conditions in the second half of as forecasted by industry experts 
we cannot accurately predict the commercial vehicle or broader economic cycle  and any deterioration of the economic recovery may lead to further reduced spending and deterioration in the markets we serve for the foreseeable future 
on march   we  along with one other united states domestic commercial vehicle steel wheel supplier  filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions with the united states international trade commission and the united states department of commerce alleging that manufacturers of certain steel wheels in china are dumping their products in the united states and that these manufacturers have been subsidized by their government in violation of united states trade laws 
in may  the international trade commission issued a preliminary determination that there was a reasonable indication that the us steel wheel industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of imports from china of certain steel wheels  and began the final phase of its investigation 
in august  the us department of commerce issued a preliminary determination of countervailing duties on steel wheels imported from china ranging from percent to percent ad valorem  and in october  the us department of commerce issued a preliminary determination of antidumping duty margins ranging from percent to percent ad valorem 
on march   the department of commerce made final determinations of dumping and subsidy margins which cumulatively were approximately percent to percent ad valorem 
however  on april   the international trade commission determined that the domestic industry has not been injured and was not presently threatened with injury from subject imports  and consequently withdrew all import duties on the subject imports 
subsequent to the international trade commission s decision  we have seen a resurgence of steel wheel imports from china in the aftermarkets we serve  creating a challenging competitive environment 
as of november   the company considered the impact of business developments in its gunite reporting unit including a loss of customer market share and evidence of declining aftermarket sales due to increased competition in the marketplace 
the gunite reporting unit had goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million at november  in addition to the recent concerns with our gunite business  the company has also experienced a recent decline in our stock price to an amount below current book value as of november  as part of the company s annual impairment review  the gunite reporting segment failed the step one goodwill impairment test  meaning that the estimate of fair value of the segment was below book value 
the company estimated the fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow model  as the company believes it is the most reliable indicator of fair value 
therefore  the second step of the analysis was performed and resulted in recognizing goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
the impairment charges are the result of lower volume demands due to lost market share at gunite  overall reduced production levels of the commercial vehicle market and its aftermarket segments in north america  operating losses for the past years and other factors

table of contents operating loss for the gunite segment was percent of its net sales for the year ended december  compared to percent of its net sales for the year ended december  the increase in operating loss was primarily attributable to the impact of increased competition  primarily from low cost countries and the loss of standard position for certain products at two oem customers in conjunction with million of restructuring charges related to closing the elkhart  indiana facility and million in impairment charges see footnotes and to consolidated financial statements in part iv item 
operating income for the brillion segment was percent of its net sales for the year ended december  compared to percent of its net sales for the year ended december  sales volume for our brillion segment increased during  particularly during the first half as the industrial and agricultural markets remained strong before reversing course in the second half of the year

the operating loss for the imperial segment was percent of its net sales for the year ended december  compared to operating income of percent of its net sales for the year ended december  the decline in operating income was due to the steep increase in demand experienced in the first half of the year which drive operating inefficiencies followed by a significant decrease in oem demand in the second half of the year  which created a difficult operating environment with low production levels

it is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year  but are not consistent from year to year 
in addition to state income taxes  the following items had the most significant impact on the difference between our statutory us federal income tax rate of percent and our effective tax rate 
in  we experienced a million increase  and a percent decrease in rates resulting from a change in our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities

our net sales for of million were percent above the combined net sales for of million 
of the total increase  approximately million was a result of higher volume demanded due to increased production levels of the commercial vehicle market and its aftermarket segments in north america 
the increased production is a result of continued increased maintenance and replacement demand of commercial vehicles see oem production builds in the table below

changes in financial condition at december   we had total assets of million  as compared to million at december  the million  or percent  decrease in total assets primarily resulted from a reduction in our ending cash position  changes in working capital and impairment of million at gunite

the company distributes earnings for the mexican foreign subsidiary and expects to distribute earnings annually 
therefore  deferred tax liabilities in the amounts of million and for and  respectively  have been established for the undistributed earnings of our mexican foreign subsidiary 
our ability to fund working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  scheduled debt payments  and to comply with any financial covenants under our abl credit facility  depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn  are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  amounted to million

on february   we exercised this right and increased the maximum capacity under the abl facility to million 
the four year abl facility matures on july  and provides for loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to the amount of the facility  subject to meeting certain borrowing base conditions  with sub limits of up to million for swingline loans and million to be available for the issuance of letters of credit 
loans under the abl facility initially bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at our option  either libor plus or base rate plus  subject to changes based on our leverage ratio as defined in the abl facility 
we must also pay a commitment fee equal to per annum to the lenders under the abl facility if utilization under the facility exceeds of the total commitments under the facility and a commitment fee equal to per annum if utilization under the facility is less than or equal to of the total commitments under the facility 
customary letter of credit fees are also payable as utilized 
the obligations under the abl facility are secured by i first priority liens on substantially all of the company s accounts receivable and inventories  subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens the abl priority collateral and ii second priority liens on substantially all of the company s owned real property and tangible and intangible assets other than the abl priority collateral  including all of the outstanding capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens the notes priority collateral 

table of contents senior secured notes also in connection the refinancing  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes 
under the terms of the indenture governing the senior secured notes  the senior secured notes bear interest at a rate of per year  paid semi annually in february and august  and mature on august  prior to maturity we may redeem the senior secured notes on the terms set forth in the indenture governing the senior secured notes 
the senior secured notes are guaranteed by the guarantors  and the senior secured notes and the related guarantees are secured by first priority liens on the notes priority collateral and second priority liens on the abl priority collateral 
on february   we completed an exchange offer pursuant to which all our outstanding senior secured notes were exchanged for registered securities with identical terms other than terms related to registration rights to the senior secured notes issued july  restrictive debt covenants 
our credit documents the abl facility and the indenture governing the senior secured notes contain operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters 
these covenants place significant restrictions on  among other things  the ability to incur additional debt  to pay dividends  to create liens  to make certain payments and investments and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities 
in addition  the abl facility contains a financial covenant which requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio during any compliance period  which is anytime when the excess availability is less than or equal to the greater of million or percent of the total commitment under the abl facility 
due to the amount of our excess availability as calculated under the abl facility  the company is not currently in a compliance period and we do not have to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio  although this is subject to change 
based on the forecasted production volumes below  we expect to be in compliance with all restrictive debt covenants through the next twelve months 
we continue  however  to operate in a challenging economic environment and our ability to maintain liquidity and comply with our debt covenants may be affected by economic or other conditions that are beyond our control and which are difficult to predict 
the production forecasts by act publications for the significant commercial vehicle markets that we serve  as of march   are as follows north american class north american classes us trailers prior convertible notes in connection with a conversion offer completed in november  we accepted all of our previously outstanding million of convertible notes for conversion and issued  shares of common stock on a pre reverse split basis to holders participating in the conversion of such notes the conversion offer 
asc requires the recognition of expense equal to the fair value of securities transferred in excess of the fair value of securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms 
related to the conversion offer  we recorded inducement expenses of million 
this charge represents the fair value of the incremental shares of common stock that were issued as a result of the conversion offer over the fair value of the shares of the common stock that the convertible note holders would have otherwise received contractually as of the date of the conversion offer 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap applied on a consistent basis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses during the reporting periods 
we continually evaluate our accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
we believe our critical accounting policies and estimates  as reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors  include impairment of long lived assets  goodwill  pensions  and income taxes 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
in performing the review of recoverability  we estimate future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and our eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require our subjective judgments 
the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  such as the determination of the primary asset group  the estimated life of the primary asset  and projected profitability  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
the company considered the impact of recent business developments in its gunite reporting unit including a loss of customer market share and evidence of declining aftermarket sales 
in addition to the recent concerns with our gunite business  the company has also experienced a recent decline in our stock price to an amount below current book value 
these events triggered a long lived asset impairment analysis for gunite 
we performed a recoverability test of the gunite s long lived assets by using an undiscounted cash flow method 
we first determined the asset group to be the gunite reporting unit  which represents the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 
our test concluded that the gunite asset group was not recoverable as the resulting undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group 
accordingly  we estimated the fair value of the long lived assets to determine the impairment amount 
determining fair value is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  considered to be level inputs 
to determine the estimated fair value of real and personal property  the market approach and cost approach were considered 
the income approach was not considered as we concluded it not feasible to allocate or attribute income to individual assets given our asset group determination to be the gunite reporting unit 
under the cost approach  the determination of fair value considered the estimates of the cost to replace or reproduce assets of equal utility at current prices with adjustments in value for physical deterioration and functional obsolescence based on the condition of the assets 
under the market approach  the determination of fair value considered the market prices in transactions for similar assets and certain direct market values based on quoted prices from brokers and market professionals 
for real estate  we concluded that the market approach was the most appropriate valuation method 
for buildings  we concluded that the cost approach was the most valuation appropriate method 
for personal property  we concluded that the cost approach  adjusted for an in exchange or salvage premise  was the most appropriate method for determining fair value 
significant level inputs for real estate and building measurements included location of the property  zoning  physical deterioration  functional obsolescence and external obsolescence 
significant level inputs for personal property included physical deterioration  functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence 
as a result of our fair value estimates  we adjusted the carrying amount of the gunite s personal property to fair value and recorded asset impairment charges of  at december  these charges were separately stated in the operating expenses the fair value estimates for the gunite personal property are based on a valuation premise that assumes the assets highest and best use are different than their current use as a result of lower volume demands for gunite s products due to the recent loss of customers  reduced production levels in the commercial vehicle market  and its declining aftermarket segments in north america 
see note  property  plant and equipment  for further discussion 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets the company performs its annual assessment for impairment of goodwill at november for all reporting units and tests these balances more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
the estimates and assumptions underlying the fair value calculations used in the company s annual impairment tests are uncertain by their nature and can vary significantly from actual results 
factors that management must estimate include  but are not limited to  industry and market conditions  sales volume and pricing  raw material costs  capital expenditures  working capital changes  cost of capital  and tax rates 
these factors are especially difficult to predict when us and global financial markets are volatile 
the estimates and assumptions used in its impairment tests are consistent with those the company uses in its internal planning 
these estimates and assumptions may change from period to period 
if the company uses different estimates and assumptions in the future  impairment charges may occur and could be material 
in performing the test on goodwill  the company utilizes the two step approach 
the first step under this guidance requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  of which the company has identified four in total  to the fair value of these reporting units 
the company uses the income approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
when we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a quantitative assessment  we compare the fair value of each reporting segment to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value using an income approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using growth rates and discount rates that are consistent with current market conditions in our industry 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets including goodwill assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets including goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment of goodwill has occurred and we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill as a component of operating income 
as a result of recent business developments in the gunite reporting unit including a loss of customer market share  evidence of declining aftermarket sales  overall reduced production levels of the commercial vehicle market  operating losses for the past several years  and recent declines in the company s stock price to an amount below book value  the gunite reporting unit failed the step one goodwill impairment test 
the company estimated the fair value of the gunite reporting unit utilizing a discounted cash flow model  as the company believes it is the most reliable indicator of fair value 
therefore  the second step of the analysis was performed resulting in the company recognizing goodwill impairment charges of million 
the wheels and brillion reporting units both passed the step one test 
however  the valuation for the wheels reporting unit is highly dependent upon projected builds for class  heavy duty trucks 
a permanent  long term decline in projected builds for these trucks could have a significant impact on the wheels reporting unit s ability to pass the step test in future periods 
the company determines the fair value of other indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily trade names  using the relief from royalty method  an income based approach 
the approach calculates fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to the asset and then discounting these after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the calculated fair value is compared to the carrying value to determine if any impairment exists 
if events or circumstances change  a determination is made by management to ascertain whether certain finite lived intangibles have been impaired based on the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows from operating activities 
if the estimated net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount necessary to write down the assets to fair value as determined from expected future discounted cash flows we performed a recoverability test of the gunite s finite lived intangible assets by using an undiscounted cash flow method 
we first determined the asset group to be the gunite reporting unit  which represents the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 
our test concluded that the gunite asset group was not recoverable as the resulting undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group 
accordingly  we estimated the fair value of the finite lived intangible assets to determine the impairment amount 
determining fair value is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  considered to be level inputs 
to determine the estimated fair value of customer relationships  the multi period excess earnings method was used 
this method is based on the concept that cash flows attributable to the assets analyzed are available after deducting costs associated with the business as well as a return on the assets employed in the generation of the cash flows 
significant level inputs for this valuation model include determining the attrition rate associated with customer revenues  contributory asset charges and required rates of return on tangible and intangible assets  as well as a discount rate for the cash flows 
to determine the fair value of technology  the relief from royalty method described above was used 
in applying this method to technology  significant level inputs include determining the technology obsolescence rate  a royalty rate  and an appropriate discount rate 
as a result of the fair value measurements for gunite s trade names  customer relationships and technology  the company recorded additional impairment charges of these intangible assets totaling million for the year ended december  pensions and other post employment benefits we account for our defined benefit pension plans and other post employment benefit plans in accordance with asc  defined benefit plans pensions  asc  defined benefit plans other postretirement  and asc  defined benefit plans general  which require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
as permitted by asc  we use a smoothed value of plan assets which is further described below 
asc requires that the effects of the performance of the pension plan s assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on our computation of pension income cost be amortized over future periods 
asc requires an employer to fully recognize the obligations associated with single employer defined benefit pension  retiree healthcare  and other postretirement plans in their financial statements 

table of contents the most significant element in determining our pension income cost in accordance with asc is the expected return on plan assets and discount rates 
in  we assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would be percent for our us plans and percent for our canadian plans 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income cost 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income cost 
the expected return on plan assets is reviewed annually  and if conditions should warrant  will be revised 
if we were to lower this rate  future pension cost would increase 
for  we currently anticipate lowering our long term rate of return assumption to percent for our us plans and percent for our canadian plans 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rates to be used to calculate the present value of each of the plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   we determined the blended rate to be percent 
the net effect of changes in the discount rate  as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience  has been deferred  in accordance with asc for the year ended december   we recognized consolidated pretax pension cost of million compared to million in we currently expect to contribute million to our pension plans during  however  we may elect to adjust the level of contributions based on a number of factors  including performance of pension investments  changes in interest rates  and changes in workforce compensation 
for the year ended december   we recognized consolidated pre tax post employment welfare benefit cost of million compared to million in we expect to contribute million during to our post employment welfare benefit plans 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and results of recent operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative operating income loss 
upon emergence from bankruptcy  the company adjusted its recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities using the valuation adjustments resulting from fresh start accounting 
we concluded at that time that we remained in a net deferred tax asset position and re evaluated the realizability of our us net deferred tax assets by assessing the likelihood of our ability to utilize them against future taxable income and availability of tax planning strategies 
we determined that a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets continued to be appropriate 
the company will continue to evaluate the likelihood of realization on a quarterly basis and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 

table of contents the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
asc provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  on the basis of the technical merits 
asc also provides guidance on measurement  de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that an increase of up to million in unrecognized tax benefits related to state exposures may be necessary within the coming year 
in addition  we believe that it is reasonably possible that approximately none of our currently remaining unrecognized tax benefits  each of which are individually insignificant  may be recognized by the end of as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates  raw material commodity prices  and interest rates 
we use derivative instruments to manage these exposures 
the objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures 
foreign currency risk certain forecasted transactions  assets  and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency derivatives 
the principal currencies of exposure are the canadian dollar and mexican peso 
from time to time  we use foreign currency financial instruments to offset the impact of the variability in exchange rates on our operations  cash flows  assets and liabilities 
at december   the notional amount of open foreign exchange forward contracts was million 
foreign currency derivative contracts provide only limited protection against currency risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our currency risk management programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of derivative instruments 
the counterparty to the foreign exchange contracts is a financial institution with an investment grade credit rating 
the use of forward contracts protects our cash flows against unfavorable movements in exchange rates  to the extent of the amount under contract 
raw material commodity price risk we rely upon the supply of certain raw materials and commodities in our production processes  and we have entered into firm purchase commitments for certain metals and natural gas 
a adverse change in pricing considering production volume would be approximately million  which would be reduced through the terms of the sales  supply  and procurement contracts 
additionally  from time to time  we use commodity price swaps and futures contracts to manage the variability in certain commodity prices on our operations and cash flows 
at december   we had no open commodity price swaps or futures contracts
