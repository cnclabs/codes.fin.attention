item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of rackspace 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements 
overview of our business we are the open cloud company  delivering open source technologies at web scale with a portfolio of cloud computing services 
our growth is the result of our technology leadership and our renowned service  known as fanatical support 
we have made significant investments in cloud computing  and over the last several years  we have made acquisitions that have expanded our product set into new areas of cloud computing  including private cloud and openstack 
we will continue to identify and pursue strategic investments that have the potential to increase our capabilities to serve customers  enhance our competitive advantage  and generate savings 
we sell our services to small and medium sized businesses  as well as large enterprises 
during  of our net revenue was generated by our operations outside of the us  mainly from the us additionally  we have operations in hong kong and recently opened a data center and sales office in australia 
our growth strategy includes  among other strategies  targeting international customers as we plan to continue our expansion in continental europe  the asia pacific region and latin america 
how we earn revenue and measure growth our subscription based business model generates the majority of our revenue on a recurring basis 
our customers pay us a recurring fee based on the size and complexity of the it systems we manage and the level of service intensity we provide  pursuant to service agreements that typically provide for monthly payments 
our public cloud service offers pay as you go services that are earned and recognized as recurring revenue as the services are provided 
revenue is reduced by credits issued to customers  primarily for service issues 
our revenue growth is primarily due to the increased volume of services provided  both because of an increasing number of new customers and incremental services rendered to existing customers  as well as a broader suite of cloud computing services acquired through acquisitions and research and development activities 
we use a metric called installed base growth to measure revenue growth derived only from our existing customer base 
our net revenue is denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies  including the pound sterling  the euro  and the hong kong dollar 
changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our net revenue 
nature of our operating expenses our operating expense categories are cost of revenue  sales and marketing  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization 
employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses  and we expect this to continue 
employee related costs include items such as wages  commissions  non equity incentive compensation  earned time off  benefits  and share based compensation 
employee non equity incentive compensation through our current non equity incentive plan is dependent upon the financial results of the company in relation to a pre set target level that is set at the beginning of each quarter 
thus  favorable financial performance in comparison to the pre set target level is partially offset by increased non equity incentive compensation expense 
additionally  the compensation committee has the discretion to increase or decrease a payout under the plan at any time in the event that it determines that circumstances warrant adjustment or to pay bonuses outside of the plan 
the metric we used for evaluating the financial results of the company is called nopat before bonus  which is calculated as net operating profit after tax nopat without the inclusion of any impact of non equity incentive compensation 
this cannot be calculated from our financial statements as we do not separately disclose total non equity incentive compensation for the period 
beginning in  we will begin using net revenue instead of nopat before bonus 

table of contents we had  and  employees as of december  and  respectively 
the year over year increase was primarily attributable to increases in our customer and data center support teams  as well as an increase in general and administrative positions  many of which are involved in the development of internal use software 
to maintain our service focus  our support teams have continued to grow with the growth of our business 
our headcount is expected to increase in as we continue to grow our business 
cost of revenue primarily consists of employee related costs of our customer support teams and data center employees  as well as the costs to operate our data centers 
the majority of our data center costs vary with the volume of services sold and include power  bandwidth  rent  and costs related to maintenance and the replacement of it equipment components 
our contracts with network operators for bandwidth capacity generally commit us to pay a monthly fee based on usage 
our data centers rely on local and regional utility companies as their primary source of power 
we have fixed price power arrangements with the electricity providers of our grapevine  texas and slough  uk data centers that expire in september another significant component of cost of revenue is costs associated with software licenses 
we enter into contracts with software providers that allow us to provide third party software to our customers 
our arrangements with these software vendors are typically one to three years in length  and we generally pay a fixed fee per license 
sales and marketing activities are directed toward both the acquisition of new customers and increasing our business with existing customers 
we pay commissions to our sales representatives generally upon execution of a service agreement 
sales and marketing expense also includes compensation to our channel partners 
marketing expenditures are used to communicate the advantages of our services and to generate customer demand 
the majority of our marketing expenditures relate to lead generation through pay per click placements on major internet search engines 
sales and marketing expenses are expected to increase slightly as a percentage of revenue because we intend to launch an initiative in to reinforce our brand as the open cloud company 
general and administrative activities are comprised of employee related costs  professional fees  general corporate costs and overhead 
while we continue to invest in our administrative infrastructure and personnel to support our growth  our focus has been and continues to be on scaling these administrative costs 
also included in general and administrative activities are expenses related to research and development activities 
as we invest more in our product portfolio  research and development expenses have increased over the last several years both in total and as a percentage of revenue 
we expect this trend to continue in depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of leasehold improvements associated with our data centers and corporate facilities  as well as depreciation of our data center infrastructure and equipment 
amortization expense is also comprised of the amortization of our customer based intangible assets related to acquisitions  internally developed technology  and software licenses purchased from third party vendors 
our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies  including the pound sterling  the euro  and hong kong dollar 
changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results 
the decrease in operating expenses due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately million  or less than  in capital expenditures our capital expenditures relate to customer gear  data center infrastructure  corporate office build outs  and internally developed software and other projects 
each category is defined below customer gear includes servers  firewalls  load balancers  cabinets  switches  backup libraries  storage arrays and drives and network cabling 
data center infrastructure includes generators  uninterruptible power supplies or ups  power distribution units  mechanical and electrical plants  chillers  raised floor and other data center building improvements 
corporate office build outs includes raised floor  furniture and general building improvements 
internally developed software and other includes salaries and payroll related costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of certain internal use software projects and other projects that meet the criteria for capitalization 

table of contents in  we expended cash or entered into lease arrangements for the purchase of customer gear of million and incurred data center infrastructure costs of million  corporate office build out costs of million and million of costs related to internally developed software and other capitalized projects 
our data center infrastructure is built to accommodate future revenue growth 
while we try to match the amount of capacity to customer demand  we consider appropriate lead times for these build outs  which requires us to build capacity ahead of actual revenue growth 
we also strive to align our investment in data center infrastructure with our revenue growth to keep utilization rates high 
we measure our utilization rate as the power being consumed by all electrical equipment relative to the total available capacity in our data centers excluding portions of the data center that have not been placed on line 
we pursue a modular build out strategy within our data centers that expands the operational footprint when needed 
from time to time  we will be required to make significant investments in new data centers or enter into long term facility leases to support expected growth beyond our ability to build out additional modules in existing facilities 
while many factors may influence our margins  in periods when we make large investments  margins may decrease 
such investments may be made in connection with data center and office expansion  as well as significant product and market development initiatives 
during  we continued to add to our existing data center footprint both in the us and internationally to support our growth  adding approximately megawatts of data center power capacity 
in april  we entered into an operating lease agreement to lease data center space with a maximum critical load power of megawatts in ashburn  virginia 
during the year we also entered into operating lease agreements for our first data center in australia and an additional data center in london 
this strategy of entering into operating lease agreements for data center space reduces the capital investments required to increase our data center capacity 
disciplined use of capital and management of profitability we have achieved net income profitability since the first quarter of through focused management of capital and profitability 
we use the economic value added model eva  which was developed by stern stewart co  as a tool to help ensure our growth and capital investments create stockholder value 
virtually all capital expenditures are evaluated against this metric using a standard cost of capital 
eva is calculated for our product offerings to evaluate our profitability 
we are also very careful with our facility and data center expansion practices 
currently  we sell to businesses in more than countries 
unlike a colocation provider  we do not need to be located near our customers  allowing us to build or lease centralized  cost optimized facilities with teams of highly trained staff 
we strive to locate our regional facilities and data centers in lower cost locations  which reduces rent  power and labor costs 
we also focus on either leasing or building sections of data centers in increments so that capital expenditures are more closely matched to revenue growth 
we have achieved a critical mass that generates long term cost advantages 
like any service that moves from distributed to centralized production  scale is a factor in ensuring costs are low enough to drive mass adoption 
we are able to generate significant cost advantages based on our large installed customer base and growth profile 
we purchase large quantities of computing and data center assets  which allows us to negotiate higher volume pricing savings 
key metrics we carefully track several financial and operational metrics to monitor and manage our growth  financial performance  and capacity 
our key metrics are structured around growth  profitability  capital efficiency  infrastructure capacity  and utilization

company highlights and developments growth of our business our business grew in with net revenue growth year over year  bringing total net revenue to billion 
our performance was the result of a combination of continued market demand for our services as well as our focused execution on our growth strategy 
as of december   we served over  customers running on over  servers within our data centers across the world  which represented incremental increases in each category as compared to our revenue growth has moved us into a new competitive landscape where our direct competitors are much larger and stronger financially 
we continue to compete more directly with amazon  microsoft  ibm and google as cloud computing services become increasingly more virtualized 
accordingly  we have been making increased infrastructure investments to complement and leverage fanatical support  our principal differentiation from our competitors across our multiple service offerings 
our cloud computing services provide customers with a mission critical service and world class support  and we believe this provides us with substantial growth opportunities 
we believe that by offering a higher service level agreement and extending our support to new open source technology platforms  our business becomes more capital efficient and our competitive advantage widens as our service capability increases 
product and service offerings we continue to invest in our public cloud service and believe it is a critical part of our future success 
public cloud continues to emerge as a new technology with high adoption rates and investment  which is reflected in its high revenue growth rate 
the primary benefit of public cloud is the value proposition that it provides for businesses because it enables them to match costs directly to revenue and to scale up and down on a real time basis as necessary 
we do not believe that public cloud will replace traditional dedicated cloud offerings because we believe the two complement one another  allowing customers to choose the best platform for each of their applications 
a focus in our growth strategy is to build our product portfolio to include higher service levels and additional capabilities 
we are investing heavily in this strategy and are creating new technologies to help businesses leverage the benefits of public cloud 
our product strategy includes the development of a variety of new capabilities and features and building a support business around the openstack cloud computing platform 
in we introduced the rackspace open cloud  which marks the first time any company has deployed a large scale open source public cloud powered by openstack 
the rackspace open cloud platform launch featured the release of several key products  including cloud servers  cloud databases  cloud monitoring  cloud backup  cloud block storage  and cloud networks  along with a powerful new control panel 
with the complete suite of openstack based cloud solutions in full production  rackspace offers an open  fast and simple cloud experience by providing customers with true choice and control without the fear of being locked into proprietary technologies 
these solutions  backed by fanatical support  further expand our portfolio and are also available under a managed service level that makes our expertise available to design  plan  deploy  optimize and maintain the environments our customers rely on for business critical applications 
we also introduced the industry first certification for openstack and announced the release of rackspace private cloud  powered by openstack  making it simple and easy for companies to install  test and run an openstack based private cloud environment 
this offering enables rackspace to extend fanatical support beyond the bounds of our data centers by remotely supporting and managing openstack environments that run in almost any data center and could become a meaningful part of our growth strategy in the long term 

table of contents the public cloud product and platform transition is a lengthy and complex process that began with a strategic decision to adopt an open source solution to power our public cloud 
this involved deploying significant resources to develop and implement the cloud products that comprise the key elements of the openstack platform  then continued through the actual roll out of the new platform  and continues today with infrastructure and support changes  new marketing and sales strategies  corporate wide knowledge development and training  and reorganization of business units as necessary for the success of the platform and products 
in the section titled  risk factors  see the risk factor  if we are unable to adapt to evolving technologies and customer demands in a timely and cost effective manner  our ability to sustain and grow our business may suffer 
while we believe that these new capabilities and features could drive future incremental demand  there are certain risks associated with such a significant product transition and platform shift 
we believe these risks could adversely impact our ability to execute on our growth strategy and therefore capitalize on the current market opportunity  both in the short and long term 
they include i the acceptance by current and prospective customers of our new public cloud and rackspace private cloud platform and product set  ii increasing competition in our industry by competitors that have greater financial  technical  and marketing resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  more established relationships in the industry  and the ability to acquire competitors and suppliers to increase their market presence and vertical reach capabilities  iii new pricing strategies that may include lowering price points for cloud products to recognize increasing technological efficiencies and offering discounted usage and volume based pricing for our cloud products to certain significant cloud customers  iv the adoption of openstack as the ubiquitous open source cloud computing platform standard for public and private clouds  which could be negatively impacted by a delay in product releases  v unfavorable economic conditions  worldwide political and economic uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we serve  including the current volatile economic environment found in europe  and vi other risks as set forth in the section titled risk factors 
other developments in february we acquired sharepoint  an industry leader in sharepoint consulting  training  and jumpstart services within sharepoint  and in august we acquired mailgun  an email services company 
while the acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial results  the acquisitions further enhance our portfolio of products and services 
we expect to make additional  similar acquisitions in the future in order to increase our service capabilities and product offerings 
in august we announced the opening of a data center in australia  which enables us to offer local dedicated cloud solutions to australian customers who prefer to keep their data onshore 
the data center will also provide the infrastructure to launch an openstack based open cloud platform in the future 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth our results of operations for the specified periods and as a percentage of our revenue for those same periods

table of contents years ended december  and net revenue our net revenue was billion during and billion during  an increase of million  or 
the increase in net revenue was primarily due to both an increasing number of new customers and incremental services rendered to existing customers 
year over year revenue increases were for our dedicated cloud service and for our public cloud service 
revenue increased in the us and in the rest of the world 
revenue is attributed to geographic location based on the operating location that enters into the contractual relationship with the customer 
partially offsetting the revenue increase outside the us was the negative impact of a stronger us dollar relative to the functional currencies of our foreign operations in compared to net revenue for would have been approximately million higher had foreign exchange rates remained constant from the prior year  with minimal impact to our margins as the majority of these customers are invoiced  and substantially all of our expenses associated with these customers are paid  by us or our subsidiaries in the functional currency of our company or our subsidiaries  respectively 
during  our monthly average churn rate was  compared to in overall  our installed base grew at a monthly average rate of in  compared to in our annual revenue growth was for our revenue growth rate decelerated year over year on a quarterly basis during from in the first quarter to in the fourth quarter 
a number of items have accounted for the growth rate deceleration with varying magnitude throughout the year  including without limitation  our ongoing public cloud platform transition  competition  and foreign exchange 
we reasonably expect that the ongoing public cloud platform transition will continue into  which may negatively impact our revenue growth rate on a year over year basis 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue was million during and million during  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in employee related expenses primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits 
these increases were the result of the hiring of data center and support personnel to support our growth 
the cost increase was further attributable to an increase in data center costs of million  related to rent  maintenance and bandwidth  and an increase in license costs of million 
the remaining increase was due to small variances in other cost of revenue expenses 
cost of revenue decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to payroll expenses increasing at a slower rate than revenue  driven by average headcount increasing compared to revenue growth of 
sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses were million during and million during  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in employee related expenses due to increases in salaries and benefits of million  share based compensation expense of million  and travel costs of million 
commissions were essentially flat 
total compensation increased as a result of the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel 
additionally  advertising and internet related marketing expenditures increased million 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses were million during and million during  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was attributable to employee related expenses due to increases in salaries and benefits of million  non equity incentive compensation of million  share based compensation expense of million and travel costs of million 
these increases are primarily due to additional headcount and equity awards granted in professional fees increased million primarily as a result of increased legal costs and consulting expenses related to accounting and tax services 
additionally  office expenses including rent and maintenance increased million  internal software support and maintenance increased million and merchant credit card fees increased million 
depreciation and amortization expense our depreciation and amortization expense was million during and million during  an increase of million  or 
this increase was a direct result of an increase in property and equipment related to depreciable assets to support the growth of our business  including increases in data center equipment and leasehold improvements due to data center build outs and internally developed and purchased software 

table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate was and in and  respectively 
the differences between our effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate of principally result from our geographical distribution of taxable income  tax credits  contingency reserves for uncertain tax positions and permanent differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items 
our foreign earnings are generally taxed at lower rates than in the united states
