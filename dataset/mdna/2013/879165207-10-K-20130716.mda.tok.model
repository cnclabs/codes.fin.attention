this includes working with the government to secure progress payments on these programs 
based on expected production releases  the company believes that it will have adequate liquidity  and backlog to fund operating plans for at least the next twelve months 
currently  the company has no material future capital expenditure requirements 
if the company is unable to obtain production releases within a reasonable period of time and or our vendors or lenders begin to pursue legal action demanding payments  it would result in a material adverse effect on the company s operations and its ability to pay its obligations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  the company applies its accounting policies as disclosed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity used in the preparation of financial statements include revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to  or acceptance by customer  provided title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer 
provisions  when appropriate  are made where the right to return exists 
in certain instances  the company may offer the unit on trial basis 
the company does not recognize revenue until the unit has been accepted 
the company only offers product on a trial basis in rare instances  and  as such  no provision has been made at march  and revenues for repairs and calibrations of the company s products represent and of revenues for the years ended march  and  respectively 
these revenues are for units that are periodically returned for annual calibrations and or for repairs after the warranty period has expired 
the company does not recognize any revenue from repairs and calibrations when the units are originally shipped 
revenues on repairs and calibrations are recognized at time the repaired or calibrated unit is shipped as it is at this time that the work is completed 
the company s terms are fob plant  and as such  delivery has occurred  and revenue recognized  when picked up and acknowledged by a common carrier 
due to the unique nature of the intermediate level tacan test set itats contract  wherein a significant portion of this contract was not delivered for over a year  revenues under this contract were recognized on a percentage of completion basis  which recognizes sales and profit as they are earned  rather than at the time of shipment 
revenues and profits were estimated using the cost to cost method of accounting where revenues are recognized and profits recorded based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimate of total costs at completion 
the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimate of total costs at completion was applied to the contract value to determine the revenues and profits 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required  any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
the company also received progress billings on this program  which is a funding mechanism by the government to assist contractors on long term contracts prior to delivery 
these progress payments are applied to unbilled government receivables resulting from revenues recognized under percentage of completion accounting 
as of march   the section of this contract was completed  the customer was billed  and the unbilled government receivables were cleared 
all other invoices on the program will be for production items  and revenues will be recognized at the time of shipment to  or acceptance by the customer  provided title and risk of loss is transferred to the customer shipping and handling costs charged to customers are classified as sales  and the shipping and handling costs incurred are included in cost of sales 
payments received prior to the delivery of units or services performed are recorded as deferred revenues 
inventory reserves inventory reserves or write downs are estimated for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these estimates are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
while such write downs have historically been within our expectation and the provision established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to receive positive results 
warranty reserves warranty reserves are based upon historical rates and specific items that are identifiable and can be estimated at time of sale 
while warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  future warranty costs could be in excess of our warranty reserves 
a significant increase in these costs could adversely affect operating results for the current period and any future periods these additional costs materialize 
warranty reserves are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates 
for the year ended march  warranty costs were  as compared to  for the year ended march  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based on customer payment and current credit worthiness  as determined by review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors credits and payments from its customers and maintains provision for estimated credit losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that have been identified 
for the year ended march  approximately of the company s sales were to the us government 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectation and the provision established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to receive positive results 
income taxes deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources  the most significant being a tax losses that can be carried forward to be utilized against profits in future years  b expenses recognized in the books but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs  and c valuation changes of assets which need to be tax effected for book purposes but are deductible only when the valuation change is realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by a valuation allowance for any tax benefit which is not more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  future taxable income is estimated  considering the realization of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can also be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event it was determined that the company would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made 
conversely  if it were determined that it would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  tel would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made 
in its evaluation of a valuation allowance  the company takes into account existing contracts and backlog  and the probability that options under these contract awards will be exercised as well as sales of existing products 
the company prepares profit projections based on the revenue and expenses forecast to determine that such revenues will produce sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is not party to any off balance sheet arrangements that may affect its financial position or its results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements no recently issued accounting pronouncements had or are expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
