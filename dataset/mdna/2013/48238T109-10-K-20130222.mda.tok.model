we cannot predict whether our growth strategy will be successful 
in addition  we cannot predict what portion of overall sales will be conducted through online auctions or other remarketing methods in the future and what impact this may have on our auction business 
overview we provide whole car and salvage auction services in north america 
our business is divided into three reportable business segments  each of which is an integral part of the vehicle remarketing industry adesa auctions  iaa and afc 
the adesa auctions segment serves an international customer base through online auctions and through whole car auction facilities in north america  that are developed and strategically located to draw professional sellers and buyers together and allow the buyers to inspect and compare vehicles remotely or in person 
openlane  a leader in internet based remarketing solutions  offers vehicles for sale from any location 
vehicles at adesa auctions 
table of contents are typically sold by commercial fleet operators  financial institutions  rental car companies  new and used vehicle dealers and vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance companies to franchise and independent used vehicle dealers 
adesa also provides value added ancillary services including inspections  storage  transportation  reconditioning  titling and other administrative services 
the iaa segment serves a domestic and international customer base through live and online auctions and through salvage vehicle auction sites in the united states and canada at december  the salvage auctions facilitate the remarketing of damaged or low value vehicles designated as total losses by insurance companies and charity donation vehicles  as well as recovered stolen or theft vehicles 
the salvage auction business specializes in providing services such as inbound transportation  titling  salvage recovery and claims settlement administrative services 
the afc segment provides short term  inventory secured financing  known as floorplan financing  primarily to independent used vehicle dealers 
at december   afc conducted business at locations in the united states and canada 
the holding company is maintained separately from the three reportable segments and includes expenses associated with the corporate office  such as salaries  benefits  and travel costs for our management team  certain human resources  information technology and accounting costs  and certain insurance  treasury  legal and risk management costs 
holding company interest expense includes the interest expense incurred on the corporate debt structure 
intercompany charges relate primarily to interest on intercompany debt or receivables and certain administrative costs allocated by the holding company 
industry trends whole car used vehicles sold in north america through whole car auctions were million  million and an estimated million in  and  respectively excluding approximately million used vehicles sold by openlane in and 
the reduction in auction volumes since is attributable to supply shortages in the north american whole car auction industry caused principally by declines in new vehicle sales and lease originations from to and declines in repossessions from to the supply shortages and resulting decline in industry auction volumes reflect a reduction in units sold by institutional consignors 
this reduction has been partially offset by an increase in dealer consignment units sold in  and other reasons for the fluctuations in industry volumes  which may also impact future volumes include new car sales in the us declined from million in to million in although new vehicle sales have climbed over the last three years to approximately million units in  the recovery in new vehicles sales has been gradual and may continue to be so for the foreseeable future 
the decline in total new vehicle sales  coupled with a tightening of consumer credit and changing policies regarding delinquent loans by the major lenders  resulted in a decline in repossessed vehicles coming to auction 
when lease residuals are below wholesale vehicle values  more vehicles are purchased by either the consumer or the grounding dealer or by dealers in online auctions  prior to the vehicles being transported to a physical auction 

table of contents as used vehicle prices have increased over the last few years  new vehicle dealers have shifted to selling more used vehicles  which can offset lower new vehicle sales 
dealers can also offer financing  warranties and insurance services on their used vehicle sales 
despite an increase in the number of trade ins dealers keep for retail sale  the number of dealer consignment vehicles remarketed through whole car auctions has increased 
there was a reduction in the number of lease originations in and  as new vehicle sales fell and lease financing was scaled back 
this decline negatively impacted the supply of off lease vehicles available at auction through and this trend could continue into based on the factors discussed above  we estimate that used vehicle auction volumes in north america  including units sold by openlane  will be approximately million units in  approach million units in and are expected to reach nearly million units by salvage vehicles deemed a total loss by automobile insurance companies represent the largest category of vehicles sold in the salvage vehicle auction industry 
the percentage of claims resulting in total losses is estimated at for  up from in there is no central reporting system that tracks the number of total loss vehicles in any given year which makes estimating industry volumes very difficult 
fluctuations in used vehicle and commodity pricing have an impact on proceeds received in the salvage vehicle auction industry 
in times of rising prices  as the industry has experienced over the last few years  revenue and gross profit are positively impacted 
if used vehicle and commodity prices moderate in  proceeds  revenue and gross profit at salvage auctions may be negatively impacted  which could adversely affect the level of profitability 
automotive finance afc works with independent used vehicle dealers to improve their results by providing a comprehensive set of business and financial solutions that leverages its local branches  industry experience and scale  as well as kar affiliations 
over the last few years  the us independent used vehicle dealer base has rebounded from approximately  dealers in to about  dealers in during this time  afc eligible dealer base has grown from  dealers in to approximately  dealers in and loan transactions have grown from  in to  in key challenges for the independent used vehicle dealer include used vehicle sales volume demand  disruptions in pricing of used vehicle inventory and lack of access to consumer financing 
these same challenges  to the extent they occur  could result in a material impact on afc results of operations 
a significant decline in used vehicle sales would result in a decrease in consumer auto loan originations and an increased number of dealers defaulting on their loans 
in addition  volatility in wholesale vehicle pricing impacts the value of recovered collateral on defaulted loans and the resulting severity of credit losses at afc 
afc implemented a number of strategic initiatives in recent years to enhance credit standards  improve portfolio risk management and enhance the customer experience 
these initiatives along with the current industry environment have enabled afc to increase its penetration of the independent dealer base while maintaining a high level of portfolio quality evidenced by low levels of net credit losses and a managed portfolio which was over percent current at december  
table of contents seasonality the volume of vehicles sold at our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter 
this seasonality is caused by several factors including weather  the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers  the availability and quality of salvage vehicles  holidays  and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles  which affects the demand side of the auction industry 
used vehicle auction volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions 
in addition  mild weather conditions and decreases in traffic volume can each lead to a decline in the available supply of salvage vehicles because fewer traffic accidents occur  resulting in fewer damaged vehicles overall 
as a result  revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis 
the fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather 
sources of revenues and expenses our revenue is derived from auction fees and related services at our whole car and salvage auctions  and from dealer financing fees and interest income at afc 
although auction revenues primarily include the auction services and related fees  our related receivables and payables include the gross value of the vehicles sold 
our operating expenses consist of cost of services  selling  general and administrative and depreciation and amortization 
cost of services is composed of payroll and related costs  subcontract services  supplies  insurance  property taxes  utilities  maintenance and lease expense related to the auction sites and loan offices 
cost of services excludes depreciation and amortization 
selling  general and administrative expenses are composed of payroll and related costs  sales and marketing  information technology services and professional fees

superstorm sandy in october  superstorm sandy damaged property throughout the eastern united states with the most significant damage concentrated in new jersey and new york 
as a direct result of superstorm sandy affect on new york city and neighboring communities  damage from the storm is estimated at over billion 
although the damage from superstorm sandy was widespread  the most significant damage was concentrated on the eastern seaboard of the united states 
kar and its subsidiaries did not experience significant damage to its properties or vehicles stored on our properties for our customers 
certain auction activities were delayed due to power outages  temporary loss of internet access and the inability of customers to attend the auctions immediately following the damage created by superstorm sandy 
iaa provides salvage auction services to substantially all of the major automobile insurance companies in the united states 
contracts with iaa insurance customers require iaa to provide services in the event of catastrophic events like superstorm sandy 
typically these catastrophic events create a temporary increase in the number of cars processed and sold 
the nature of the damage  the 
table of contents need to service our customers in a short period of time and the geographic concentration in a heavily populated  high cost area  led to substantially increased costs incurred to handle the significantly greater volumes of vehicles 
iaa has experienced a number of catastrophic events over the last years  most notably hurricane katrina  and none of these individual catastrophic events has resulted in a net loss to iaa 
superstorm sandy was unique in that its impact was greatest in the densely populated new york city area 
this resulted in a high concentration of total loss vehicles in a relatively small geographic area 
it is estimated that superstorm sandy damaged over  vehicles 
iaa customers assigned over  total loss vehicles to iaa for processing 
in order to store and process these vehicles  iaa secured over acres of temporary space in new york and new jersey 
in addition  the difficult infrastructure of the new york city and long island areas and the shortage of towing capacity required iaa to incur significantly greater towing costs to move damaged vehicles to its sites for processing 
in order to serve our customers in this region  iaa had to bring hundreds of employees to the affected areas to assist in the timely processing of these vehicles 
all of these activities resulted in a temporary increase in costs related to superstorm sandy vehicles 
in the fourth quarter of  iaa incurred a non recurring pre tax net loss of million related to the processing of superstorm sandy vehicles 
this net loss has been excluded from adjusted ebitda in accordance with the definitions in our credit agreement 
furthermore  the sale of superstorm sandy vehicles in is expected to result in an additional pre tax net loss of approximately million 
this loss will be incurred in the first half of with a majority of the activity taking place in the first quarter of these losses are net of auction services revenue realized or to be realized upon the sale of the vehicles 
the significantly higher tow costs incurred in order to respond to the requirements of our customers  increased occupancy costs due to the leasing of temporary locations to process superstorm sandy vehicles and increased labor costs for the temporary work force brought into the new york and new jersey area will result in a net loss on the sale of the superstorm sandy vehicles 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily representative of an increase of million related to openlane  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by a net decrease in depreciation and amortization as five year life computer software and technology assets  revalued as part of the april  merger between adesa and iaa  became fully amortized 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was primarily representative of million in interest expense incurred in the second quarter of in connection with the settlement and termination of our million notional swap agreement 
in addition  interest expense decreased as a result of the second quarter prepayment of our million principal amount senior notes and the remaining million principal balance of our senior subordinated notes  partially offset by term loan b debt  which had an interest rate of at december   compared with our previous term loan debt  which had an interest rate of approximately until its prepayment in may the decrease in interest expense was also partially offset by an increase in interest expense at afc  which resulted from an increase in the average us portfolio financed in as compared with  as well as an increase in the cost of funds  beginning in the second quarter of

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe that the significant indicators of liquidity for our business are cash on hand  cash flow from operations  working capital and amounts available under our credit facility 
our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash generated by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
december  dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents restricted cash working capital amounts available under credit facility cash flow from operations there were related outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which reduced the amount available for borrowings under the credit facility 
working capital a substantial amount of our working capital is generated from the payments received for services provided 
the majority of our working capital needs are short term in nature  usually less than a week in duration 
due to the decentralized nature of the business  payments for most vehicles purchased are received at each auction and branch 
most of the financial institutions place a temporary hold on the availability of the funds deposited that generally can range up to two business days  resulting in cash in our accounts and on our balance sheet that is unavailable for use until it is made available by the various financial institutions 
there are outstanding checks book overdrafts to sellers and vendors included in current liabilities 
because a portion of these outstanding checks for operations in the us are drawn upon bank accounts at financial institutions other than the financial institutions that hold the cash  we cannot offset all the cash and the outstanding checks on our balance sheet 
our available cash  which excludes cash in transit  was million at december  of this amount  approximately million was held by foreign subsidiaries  a portion of which is considered to be permanently reinvested in our non us businesses 
if the portion of funds held by our foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be permanently reinvested were to be repatriated  tax expense would need to be accrued at the us statutory rate  net of any applicable foreign tax credits 
such foreign tax credits would substantially offset any us taxes that would be due in the event cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was repatriated 
afc offers short term inventory secured financing  also known as floorplan financing  to independent used vehicle dealers 
financing is primarily provided for terms of to days

credit facilities on may   we established a billion  six year senior secured term loan facility term loan b and a million  five year senior secured revolving credit facility  the terms of which are set forth in the credit agreement  dated as of may  the credit agreement 
the credit facility is available for letters of credit  working capital and general corporate purposes including refinancing certain existing indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides that with respect to the revolving credit facility  up to million is available for letters of 
table of contents credit and up to million is available for swing line loans 
the credit agreement also permits up to million of additional revolving or term loan commitments from one or more of the existing lenders or other lenders with the consent of the administrative agent 
on november   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement 
the amendment provided for  among other things  modifications to the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement financial covenant and modifications to increase the amount of restricted payments as defined in the credit agreement permitted to be paid under the credit agreement 
restricted payments include  among other things  dividends  stock buybacks and other payments made in respect of the company equity securities 
term loan b was issued at a discount of million 
the discount is being amortized to interest expense over the six year term of the loan 
term loan b is payable in quarterly installments equal to of the original aggregate principal amount 
payments commenced on september   and the balance is payable at maturity 
the credit facility is subject to mandatory prepayments and reduction in an amount equal to i the net proceeds of certain debt offerings  asset sales and certain insurance recovery events  and ii for any fiscal year ending on or after december   any excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement  on or before the th day following the end of the fiscal year 
there were no excess cash flow payments  as defined  due for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the company has estimated that an excess cash flow payment of approximately million will be made in the second quarter of the prepayment will be credited to prepay in order of maturity the unpaid amounts due on the next eight scheduled quarterly installments of term loan b  and thereafter to the remaining scheduled quarterly installments of term loan b on a pro rata basis 
as such  after the march  quarterly installment on term loan b and the excess cash flow payment  there will be no further quarterly installments due until june  term loan b bears interest at an adjusted libor rate plus with an adjusted libor rate floor of per annum and revolving loan borrowings at an adjusted libor rate plus  however  for specified types of borrowings  the company may elect to make term loan borrowings at a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus and revolving loan borrowings at a base rate plus 
the rate on term loan b was at december  in addition  if the company reduces its consolidated senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement  which is based on a net debt calculation  to levels specified in the credit agreement  the applicable interest rate will step down by basis points 
the company also pays a commitment fee of basis points  payable quarterly  on the average daily unused amount of the credit facility 
the fee may step down to basis points based on the company consolidated senior secured leverage ratio as described above 
on december    million was outstanding on term loan b and there were no borrowings on the revolving credit facility 
at december   million was drawn on the revolving credit facility 
in addition  there were related outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million and million at december  and december   respectively  which reduce the amount available for borrowings under the credit facility 
our canadian operations also have a c million line of credit which was undrawn as of december  however  there were related letters of credit outstanding totaling approximately c million at december   which reduce credit available under the canadian line of credit  but do not affect amounts available for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the obligations of the company under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries the subsidiary guarantors and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and the subsidiary guarantors  including but not limited to a pledges of and perfected first priority security interests in of the equity interests of certain of the company and the 
table of contents subsidiary guarantors domestic subsidiaries and of the equity interests of certain of the company and the subsidiary guarantors first tier foreign subsidiaries and b perfected first priority security interests in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the company and each subsidiary guarantor  subject to certain exceptions 
the credit agreement contains certain restrictive loan covenants  including  among others  a financial covenant requiring that a maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio be satisfied as of the last day of each fiscal quarter if revolving loans are outstanding  and covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make acquisitions  consummate change of control transactions  dispose of assets  pay dividends  make capital expenditures  make investments and engage in certain transactions with affiliates 
the leverage ratio covenant is based on consolidated adjusted ebitda  which is ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude among other things a gains and losses from asset sales  b unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in respect of indebtedness  c certain non recurring gains and losses  d stock option expense  e certain other noncash amounts included in the determination of net income  f management  monitoring  consulting and advisory fees paid to the equity sponsors  g charges and revenue reductions resulting from purchase accounting  h unrealized gains and losses on hedge agreements  i minority interest  j expenses associated with the consolidation of salvage operations  k consulting expenses incurred for cost reduction  operating restructuring and business improvement efforts  l expenses realized upon the termination of employees and the termination or cancellation of leases  software licenses or other contracts in connection with the operational restructuring and business improvement efforts  m expenses incurred in connection with permitted acquisitions  n any impairment charges or write offs of intangibles  and o any extraordinary  unusual or nonrecurring charges  expenses or losses 
certain covenants contained within the credit agreement are critical to an investor understanding of our financial liquidity  as the failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could result in a default and allow our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed immediately due and payable 
the maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio is required to be met when there are revolving loans outstanding under our credit agreement 
beginning with the quarter ended december  the ratio could not exceed to and continues to decline throughout the remaining life of the credit facility until it reaches to at march  our actual consolidated senior secured leverage ratio was to at december  in addition  the indenture governing our floating rate senior notes contains certain financial and operational restrictions that  similar to the credit agreement  limit our ability to pay dividends and other distributions  make certain acquisitions or investments  incur indebtedness  grant liens and sell assets 
the covenants in the credit agreement and the indenture governing our floating rate senior notes affect our operating flexibility by  among other things  restricting our ability to incur expenses and indebtedness that could be used to grow the business  as well as to fund general corporate purposes 
we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement and the indenture governing our floating rate senior notes at december  we believe our sources of liquidity from our cash and cash equivalents on hand  working capital  cash provided by operating activities  and availability under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our short and long term operating needs for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we believe the previously mentioned sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements and debt service payments for the next twelve months

after the occurrence of a termination event  as defined in the us securitization agreement  the bank conduit facility may  and could  cause the stock of afc funding corporation to be transferred to the bank conduit facility  though as a practical matter the bank conduit facility would look to the liquidation of the receivables under the transaction documents as their primary remedy 
proceeds from the revolving sale of receivables to the bank conduit facility are used to fund new loans to customers 
afc  afc funding corporation and afci must maintain certain financial covenants including  among others  limits on the amount of debt afc and afci can incur  minimum levels of tangible net worth  and other covenants tied to the performance of the finance receivables portfolio

at december   we were in compliance with the covenants in the securitization agreements 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as presented herein  are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
they are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered substitutes for net income loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap 
ebitda is defined as net income loss  plus interest expense net of interest income  income tax provision benefit  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is ebitda adjusted for the items of income and expense and expected incremental revenue and cost savings  as described above in the discussion of certain restrictive loan covenants under credit facilities 
management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about one of the principal measures of performance used by our creditors 
in addition  management uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate our performance and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results as reported under gaap

for a discussion of the company capital expenditures  see capital expenditures below 
net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the change in net cash used by financing activities was primarily attributable to the repayment of million that was outstanding on our revolving credit facility  as well as a decrease in book overdrafts for the year ended december  and the payment of million in dividends to stockholders in the fourth quarter of capital expenditures capital expenditures for the years ended december  and approximated million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures were greater than expected in and related directly to capital deployed in the fourth quarter in order to handle superstorm sandy vehicles 
capital expenditures were funded primarily from internally generated funds 
we continue to invest in our core information technology capabilities and capacity expansion 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million for fiscal year anticipated expenditures are primarily attributable to ongoing information system projects  integration of openlane and adesa information systems  upkeep and improvements at existing vehicle auction facilities  improvements in information technology systems and infrastructure and expansion and relocation of existing auction sites that are at capacity 
future capital expenditures could vary substantially based on capital project timing and the initiation of new information systems projects to support our business strategies

table of contents expect to pay a quarterly dividend of per share in using cash flow from operations 
on february   the board of directors announced a cash dividend of per share payable on april   to stockholders of record at the close of business on march  future dividend decisions will be based on and affected by a variety of factors  including our financial condition and results of operations  contractual restrictions  including restrictive covenants contained in our credit agreement  afc securitization facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding debt securities  capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 
we have no prior history of declaring or paying any cash or other dividends  and no assurance can be given as to whether any future dividends may be declared by our board of directors or the amount thereof 
contractual obligations the table below sets forth a summary of our contractual debt and lease obligations as of december  some of the figures included in this table are based on management estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we may actually pay in future periods could vary from those reflected in the table

table of contents critical accounting estimates in preparing the financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex 
consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounting measurements that management believes are most critical to the reported results of our operations and financial condition include uncollectible receivables and allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts  goodwill and long lived assets  self insurance programs  legal proceedings and other loss contingencies and income taxes 
in addition to the critical accounting estimates  there are other items used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in cases where management estimates are used  they are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals  and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
in addition  our most significant accounting policies are discussed in note and elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   which are included in this annual report on form k 
uncollectible receivables and allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowances for credit losses and doubtful accounts are based on management evaluation of the receivables portfolio under current economic conditions  the volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio credit quality  review of specific collection matters and such other factors which  in management judgment  deserve recognition in estimating losses 
specific collection matters can be impacted by the outcome of negotiations  litigation and bankruptcy proceedings 
due to the nature of our business  substantially all trade receivables are due from vehicle dealers  salvage buyers  institutional customers and insurance companies 
we generally have possession of vehicles or vehicle titles collateralizing a significant portion of these receivables 
at the auction sites  risk is mitigated through a pre auction registration process that includes verification of identification  bank accounts  dealer license status  acceptable credit history  buying history at other auctions and the written acceptance of all of the auction policies and procedures 
afc allowance for credit losses includes an estimate of losses for finance receivables 
afc controls credit risk through credit approvals  credit limits  underwriting and collateral management monitoring procedures  which includes holding vehicle titles where permitted 
goodwill and long lived assets when we acquire businesses  we estimate and recognize the fair values of tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the purchase accounting process requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are 
table of contents inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may be impaired 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market valuation relative to our book value 
in assessing goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and earnings  changes in our business strategy and economic conditions affecting market valuations related to the fair values of our three reporting units which consist of our three operating and reportable business segments adesa auctions  iaa and afc 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
asc permits an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment model 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
the quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and we must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with asc  business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
we review long lived assets for possible impairment whenever circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if it is determined that the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds the total amount of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from that asset  we would recognize a loss to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
management judgment is involved in both deciding if testing for recovery is necessary and in estimating undiscounted cash flows 
our impairment analysis is based on the current business strategy  expected growth rates and estimated future economic conditions 
self insurance programs we self insure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program  as well as a portion of our automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims 
we have insurance coverage that limits the exposure on individual claims 
we also have insurance coverage that limits the total exposure to overall automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims 
the cost of the insurance is expensed over the contract periods 
we record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits  automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims 
trends in healthcare costs could have a significant impact on anticipated claims 
if actual claims are higher than anticipated  our accrual might be insufficient to cover the claims costs  which would have an adverse impact on the operating results in that period 

table of contents legal proceedings and other loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various legal proceedings and other loss contingencies  many involving litigation incidental to the business and a variety of environmental laws and regulations 
litigation and other loss contingencies are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes of such matters are often very difficult to predict and generally are resolved over long periods of time 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
estimating probable losses requires the analysis of multiple possible outcomes that often are dependent on the judgment about potential actions by third parties 
contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements  or otherwise disclosed  in accordance with asc  contingencies 
we accrue for an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
management regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether accrual amounts should be adjusted 
if the amount of an actual loss is greater than the amount accrued  this could have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period 
legal fees are expensed as incurred 
income taxes all income tax amounts reflect the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with different tax rates and must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we will undergo scheduled reviews by taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
tax reviews often require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
we record our tax provision based on existing laws  experience with previous settlement agreements  the status of current irs or other taxing authority examinations and management understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
we establish reserves when we believe that certain positions may not prevail if challenged by a taxing authority 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the new guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not that the indefinte lived intangible asset is impaired  then no further action is required 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
the new guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   however  early adoption is permitted 

table of contents we do not expect the adoption of asu will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency our foreign currency exposure is limited and arises from transactions denominated in foreign currencies  particularly intercompany loans  as well as from translation of the results of operations from our canadian and  to a much lesser extent  mexican subsidiaries 
however  fluctuations between us and us currency values may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts to hedge changes in the canadian or mexican exchange rates 
canadian currency translation negatively affected net income by approximately million for the year ended december  and positively affected net income by approximately million for the year ended december  currency exposure of our mexican operations is not material to the results of operations 
interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate borrowings 
accordingly  interest rate fluctuations affect the amount of interest expense we are obligated to pay 
we use interest rate derivative agreements to manage the variability of cash flows to be paid due to interest rate movements on our variable rate debt 
we have designated our interest rate derivatives as cash flow hedges 
the earnings impact of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded upon the recognition of the interest related to the hedged debt 
any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationships is recognized in current earnings 
there was no significant ineffectiveness in the years ended december  or in august  we purchased three interest rate caps for an aggregate amount of approximately million with an aggregate notional amount of million to manage our exposure to interest rate movements on our variable rate term loan b credit facility when one month libor exceeds 
the interest rate cap agreements each had an effective date of august  and each mature on august  the fair value of the interest rate derivatives is based on quoted market prices for similar instruments from commercial banks 
at december   the aggregate fair value of the three interest rate caps was a less than million asset recorded in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the aggregate fair value of the three interest rate caps was a million asset recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
unrealized gains or losses on the interest rate derivatives are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   there was a net unrealized loss totaling million  net of tax benefits of million 
at december   there was a net unrealized gain totaling million  net of tax benefits of less than million 
we were exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties  however  non performance is not anticipated 
we have only partially hedged our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our variable rate debt 
a sensitivity analysis of the impact on our variable rate debt instruments to a hypothetical basis point increase in short term rates for the year ended december  would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately million
