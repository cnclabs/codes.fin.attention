recent accounting pronouncements refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to net revenue  allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation  valuation of deferred income taxes  goodwill valuation  warranty reserves  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
a significant portion of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
therefore  the recognition of net revenue and related cost of revenue from sales to these distributors are deferred until the distributor resells the product 
when product revenue is recognized  we establish an estimated allowance for future product returns based on historical returns experience 
actual product returns or pricing adjustments that differ from our estimates could result in increases or decreases to revenue 
additionally  we sell extended warranty services  which extend the warranty period for an additional one to three years  depending upon the product 
warranty net revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the warranty service period 
warranty reserve the standard warranty periods for our products typically range from one to five years 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based upon our historical warranty experience  and additionally for any known product warranty issues 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs that differ from our estimates 
as a result  increases or decreases to warranty reserves could be required  which could impact our gross margins 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts and the general condition of the industry 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and impact our reported financial results 
inventory valuation our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess and obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future sales demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally twelve months 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing 
in addition  specific reserves are recorded to cover risks in the area of end of life products  inventory located at our contract manufacturers  deferred inventory in our sales channel and warranty replacement stock 
if our sales forecast is less than the inventory we have on hand at the end of an accounting period  we may be required to take excess and obsolete inventory charges  which will decrease our gross margin and net operating results for that period 
valuation of deferred income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to zero  primarily due to historical net operating losses and uncertainty of generating future taxable income 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize a deferred tax asset that currently has a valuation allowance  we would be required to reverse the valuation allowance  which would be reflected as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations at that time 
goodwill impairment testing in performing our goodwill impairment testing  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we conduct a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the analysis  which involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill  the difference of which represents the impairment loss 
the determination of the reporting unit s fair value requires significant judgment and is based on management s best estimate 
we generally use valuation techniques based on our market capitalization and multiples of revenue for similar companies 
in addition  management may consider the reporting unit s expected future earnings  and a control premium  which is the amount that a buyer is willing to pay over the current market price of a company as indicated by the traded price per share ie  market capitalization  in order to acquire a controlling interest 
if our actual financial results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit  we may be exposed to goodwill impairment losses 
during the fiscal year ended june   we made a qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment exists 
since we did not determine that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we were not required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
as of june   our book value was million while our market capitalization was million 
share based compensation we record share based compensation in the statements of operations as an expense  based on the estimated grant date fair value of our share based awards  whereby such fair values are amortized to expense over the requisite service period 
our share based awards are currently comprised of common stock options granted under our stock incentive plan and common stock purchase rights granted under our employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value of our common stock option and stock purchase rights is generally estimated on the grant date using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing formula 
while utilizing the bsm model meets established requirements  the estimated fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our share based awards as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based awards utilizing the bsm model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including the expected term  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yields 
the expected term of our stock options is generally estimated using the simplified method  as permitted by guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission sec 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on the us treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected term of our stock options and stock purchase rights 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  share based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested share based awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net revenue by product line the following table presents our net revenue by product line years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages embedded device enablement   external device management   device management    net revenue    to more closely align our product lines with how they are marketed  sold and deployed  we re categorized our product lines as follows i embedded device enablement products are now referred to as oem modules and ii external device enablement and device management products have been combined into a single product line and are now referred to as enterprise solutions 
the following table presents our re categorized net revenue by product line years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages oem modules   enterprise solutions   net revenue    the increase in net revenue from our oem modules product line was primarily due to increased unit sales of our asic  new premierwave en  xport direct and new xpico product families 
the unit increases for asic and premierwave en were primarily related to increased production for two existing customers in emea and japan  respectively 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in unit sales of our xport pro  matchport bg and wiport product families 
the unit decreases for xport pro were primarily related to the design out of a single customer 
the unit decreases for matchport bg and wiport were primarily related to the maturity of these products 
the increase in net revenue from our enterprise solutions product line was primarily due to increased unit sales of our new xprintserver product family 
in addition  we experienced increased unit sales of our eds product family and our new xdirect and premierewave xn product families 
these increases were partially offset by i a decrease in unit sales of our uds family in the americas and emea geographic regions primarily due to the maturity of the product  ii a decrease in unit sales of spider products as a result of the timing in customers project deployments  and iii a decrease in mss device server and scs console server families due to product end of life 
net revenue by geographic region and product line the following table presents net revenue by geographic region and product line years ended june  oem modules enterprise solutions total oem modules enterprise solutions total americas      emea      japan     asia pacific      the increase in net revenue primarily reflects increased unit sales in the americas and asia pacific regions 
the increase in net revenue in the americas region was primarily due to increased unit sales of our new xprintserver product family 
to a lesser extent  the increase in the americas was impacted by sales from other new product releases including the xpico  xdirect  and premierwave xn product families 
the increase in net revenue in the japan region was primarily due to an increase in production volumes for a single customer of our premierwave en product family 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenue less cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consisted primarily of the cost of raw material components  subcontract labor assembly from contract manufacturers  manufacturing overhead  establishing or relieving inventory reserves for excess and obsolete products or raw materials  warranty costs  royalties and share based compensation 
the following table presents gross profit years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages gross profit   the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenue referred to as gross margin was impacted by an increase in expedited freight costs 
in addition  gross margin was affected by the growth in sales  as a percentage of total net revenues  of certain lower margin new products 
since newer products typically have lower margins until they reach production volumes  we may experience downward pressure on gross margins if new product revenues continue to grow as a percentage of total net revenue 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consisted of personnel related expenses including salaries and commissions  share based compensation  facility expenses  information technology  trade show expenses  advertising and professional legal and accounting fees 
the following table presents selling  general and administrative expenses years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages personnel related expenses   professional fees and outside services   advertising and marketing   facilities   travel share based compensation depreciation severance other selling  general and administrative   the increase in selling  general and administrative was primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing fees related to various marketing initiatives attributable to new products releases 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was partially offset by decreases in i professional fees and outside services due to a reduction associated with the implementation of various cost cutting programs  as well as the fact that in the prior year  the balance included fees related to the special investigation that was completed during the quarter ended september   and ii certain facilities related equipment and insurance expenses 
research and development research and development expenses consisted of personnel related expenses including share based compensation  as well as expenditures to third party vendors for research and development activities  and product certification costs 
the following table presents research and development expenses years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages personnel related expenses   facilities outside services product certifications share based compensation depreciation other research and development   the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to a decrease in variable compensation and lower travel and other miscellaneous expenses 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the cost of outside services and certifications primarily related to development costs for new products 
other expense  net the following table presents other expense  net years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages other expense  net other expense  net  is comprised of foreign currency remeasurement and transaction adjustments related to our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar 
during fiscal year  as a result of the final dissolution of our foreign subsidiary in france  we reclassified to other income  in accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments related to this subsidiary that were previously suspended in accumulated other comprehensive income 
provision for income taxes the following table presents the income tax provision years ended june  of net of net change revenue revenue in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes the following table presents our effective tax rate based upon our income tax provision years ended june  effective tax rate we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate resulted primarily from the effect of our domestic losses recorded without a tax benefit  as well as the effect of foreign earnings taxed at rates differing from the federal statutory rate 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
as a result of our cumulative losses and uncertainty of generating future taxable income  we provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets for the fiscal years ended june  and due to the change of ownership provision of the tax reform act of  utilization of our net operating loss nol carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation against taxable income in future periods 
as a result of the annual limitation  a portion of these carryforwards may expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future income tax liabilities 
the following table summarizes our nols june  in thousands federal  state our nol carryovers for federal and state income tax purposes begin to expire in fiscal years and  respectively 
at june   our fiscal year ended through fiscal year ended tax years remain open to examination by federal  state  and foreign taxing authorities 
however  we have nols beginning in fiscal year ended which would cause the statute of limitations to remain open for the year in which the nol was incurred 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the following table presents details of our working capital and cash and cash equivalents june  increase decrease in thousands working capital    cash and cash equivalents    our principal sources of cash and liquidity include our existing cash and cash equivalents  amounts available under our credit facilities  and cash generated from operations 
we believe that these sources will be sufficient to fund our current requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and other financial commitments for at least the next months 
we anticipate that the primary factors affecting our cash and liquidity are net revenue  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
management defines cash and cash equivalents as highly liquid deposits with original maturities of days or less when purchased 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents balances at certain financial institutions in excess of amounts insured by federal agencies 
management does not believe this concentration subjects us to any unusual financial risk beyond the normal risk associated with commercial banking relationships 
we frequently monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our net revenue  research and development expenses  and expenses associated with any strategic partnerships or acquisitions and infrastructure investments 
we incurred a net loss of million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents  amounts available under our credit facilities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures  our working capital and other cash requirements 
from time to time  we may seek additional capital from public or private offerings of our capital stock  borrowings under our existing or future credit lines or other sources in order to i develop or enhance our products  ii take advantage of future opportunities  iii respond to competition or iv continue to operate our business 
if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds  our existing stockholders may experience dilution  and the new equity or debt securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
loan agreement we have a loan and security agreement the loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank svb dated may  we also have i a loan and security agreement ex im program the ex im loan and security agreement dated may  with terms that are generally parallel to the loan and security agreement and ii an export import bank of the united states the ex im bank working capital guarantee program borrower agreement the guarantee agreement 
on october   we entered into amendments to the svb loan agreements  effective september   and also re executed the guarantee agreement as of october  the amendments 
we collectively refer to the loan and security agreement and the ex im loan and security agreement herein  as each have been amended from time to time  as the amended svb loan agreements 
the loan and security agreement and the ex im loan and security agreement were established in favor of svb for the purpose of providing us with working capital to finance the manufacture  production or purchase and subsequent export of our finished goods or services and a means to use our assets related to our domestic and foreign receivables to secure our borrowings 
the ex im loan and security agreement and the guaranty agreement were established primarily as a means to use our assets related to our foreign receivables to secure our borrowings 
svb and the ex im bank required that we execute the guarantee agreement as a condition precedent to svb establishing the loan and security agreement and ex im bank providing the guarantee agreement 
the amended svb loan agreements provide for a revolving line of credit that in the aggregate may not exceed million and a million term loan the term loan 
the extended maturity date for the revolving line of credit under the amended svb loan agreements is september  the amendments also reduced the interest rate to a rate per annum equal to the greater of the prime rate plus or  provided that we maintain a monthly quick ratio of to or greater 
the quick ratio measures our ability to use our cash and cash equivalents maintained at svb or quick assets to extinguish or retire our current liabilities immediately 
if this ratio is not met  the interest rate will become the greater of the prime rate plus or 
additionally  the interest rate on the term loan was reduced to the prime rate plus  payable monthly 
the amendments required the payment of a fee of  for the amended loan and security agreement and  for the amended ex im loan and security agreement  upon execution  respectively 
we also are required to pay an additional  and  fee for the amended loan and security agreement and amended ex im loan and security agreement  respectively  on september  pursuant to the amended svb loan agreements  the available borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit is limited to the lesser of i million or ii the current portion of the trade receivable balance  less of the balance of deferred revenue  less outstanding borrowings on the revolving line of credit 
as of june   there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving line of credit under the amended svb loan agreements and the term loan is being repaid over equal monthly installments with a maturity date of september  the amended svb loan agreements adjusted our minimum tangible net worth minimum tnw covenant beginning as of september  from approximately million to million 
this amount will adjust upward  as further defined in the agreements  to the extent we raise additional equity or debt financing or achieve net income in future quarters 
our actual tangible net worth actual tnw is calculated as total shareholders equity  less goodwill 
if we continue to incur net losses  we may have difficulty satisfying the minimum tnw financial covenant in the future 
the following table sets forth the minimum tnw compared to our actual tnw june  in thousands minimum tnw  actual tnw  the following table presents the balance outstanding on the term loan  the available borrowing capacity on the revolving line of credit and outstanding letters of credit  which were used as security deposits 
to date  we have not used any of the borrowing capacity under the revolving line 
the available borrowing capacity under the revolving line set forth below reflects a change in the method of calculating our borrowing capacity for foreign trade receivables whereby only trade receivables derived from shipments originating within the us are used to determine our borrowing capacity  which effectively reduces our borrowing capacity to the extent we ship products to foreign customers from an overseas warehouse 
june  in thousands term loan available borrowing capacity  outstanding letters of credit as of june   approximately  of our cash was held in foreign subsidiary bank accounts 
this cash is unrestricted with regard to foreign liquidity needs  however  our ability to utilize a portion of this cash to satisfy liquidity needs outside of such foreign locations may be subject to approval by the foreign location board of directors 
cash flows the following table presents the major components of the consolidated statements of cash flows years ended june  increase decrease in thousands net cash used in operating activities   net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities operating activities the increase in net cash used in operating activities for fiscal was primarily due to an increase in inventories resulting from i increased buffer stock to help improve our ability to fulfill expected customer demand and to support the introduction of new products  and ii inventory purchases in anticipation of expected customer demand 
we also utilized cash in the current year period to pay down accrued royalties and other liabilities 
the increase in the use of cash was partially offset by the reduction in our net loss for the current year period 
investing activities the increase in net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was primarily related to the increase in capital expenditures for the purchase of property and equipment  primarily related to tooling and test equipment for new products and manufacturing sites 
financing activities the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was primarily related to the proceeds we received from the sale of common shares through the private placement and public offering that occurred during fiscal in the current year  net cash used in financing activities was primarily for principal payments on our term loan and capital lease obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of june   we were not involved in any material unconsolidated spes
