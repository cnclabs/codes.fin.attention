vision leading edge system solutions  solving the most difficult problems where performance matters  reliability is vital and security is non negotiable 
our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to successfully develop new technologies and products  and is complemented by our ability to implement our selective acquisitions strategy 
new technologies or products that we may develop may not lead to an incremental increase in revenues  and there is a risk that these new technologies or products will decrease the demand for our existing products and result in an offsetting reduction in revenues 
there can be no assurance that the benefits of any acquisition will outweigh the attendant costs  and if they do not  our results of operations and stock price may be adversely affected 
net sales decreased million or  to million in from billion in and increased million or  from million in for and  we estimate that between to and to  respectively  of net sales were derived from acquisitions concluded in each such fiscal year and each end market benefited from products we added from recent acquisitions 
estimated sales by end markets are based on our understanding of end market uses of our products 
our analysis of sales by end markets may be found in the results of operations section below 
we believe an estimated breakout of net sales by end markets for the last three fiscal years is approximately as follows amounts in thousands aerospace communications defense security industrial total gross profit increased million between and  to million of sales for from million of sales for and increased million between and  from million of sales for gross margin improvements resulted from integration and cost improvement activities at both acquired and existing locations 
during  we recorded million of acquisition related inventory charges related to manufacturing profit in acquired inventory 
further  we recorded million from an inventory write off related to flooding in thailand  net of insurance recoveries 
these charges did not recur in gross margin for was favorably impacted by higher margin products related to microsemi soc  cost optimization programs  transfer of manufacturing to lower cost and more efficient facilities including the closure of our scottsdale facility and reductions in personnel 
during  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of bridging inventory that we intended to complete at other locations and million for the write off of medical inventory that did not meet our corporate gross margin targets 
also in  we recorded a million charge for scottsdale remediation and fixed assets that we abandoned as part of our scottsdale facility closure and acquisition related inventory charges million related to manufacturing profit in acquired inventory 
uncertain macroeconomic conditions worldwide subject us to certain risks see part i  item a  risk factors  negative or uncertain worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations  the concentration of the facilities that service the semiconductor industry  including facilities of current or potential vendors or customers  makes us more susceptible to events or disasters affecting the areas in which they are most concentrated  and we may be unable to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy or integrate acquired companies and personnel with existing operations 
undue reliance should not be placed on our backlog or book to bill ratios or changes to these amounts 
we determine bookings substantially based on orders that are scheduled for delivery within months 
however  lead times for the release of purchase orders depend  in part  upon the scheduling practices of individual customers  and delivery times of new or non standard products can be affected by scheduling factors and other manufacturing considerations 
the rate of booking new orders can vary significantly from month to month 
customers frequently change their delivery schedules or cancel orders 
see part i  item a  risk factors  we may not make the sales that are suggested by our order rates  backlog or book to bill ratio  and our book to bill ratio may be affected by product mix 
approximately of total net sales in were in the defense security end market and sales in this end market highly correlate to customers whose principal sales are to the us government or to subcontractors whose material sales are to the us government 
we are subject to the impacts of potential us federal government shutdowns  sequestration under the budget control act of and other risks related to us government sales see part i  item a  risk factors  reliance on government contracts for a portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
we closed our scottsdale facility during the second quarter of we may make further specific determinations to consolidate  close  sell or divest additional facilities  operations or product lines  which could be announced at any time 
possible adverse consequences from current and future consolidation or disposition activities may include a loss of revenues and various accounting charges such as for workforce reduction  including severance and other termination benefits and for excess facilities  including lease termination fees  future contractual commitments to pay lease charges  facility remediation costs and moving costs to remove property and equipment from facilities 
we may also be adversely impacted from inventory buildup in preparation for the transition of manufacturing  disposition costs  impairments of goodwill  a possible immediate loss of revenues  and other items in addition to normal or attendant risks and uncertainties 
we may be unsuccessful in any of our current or future efforts to consolidate our business into a smaller number of facilities 
our plans to minimize or eliminate any loss of revenues during consolidation may not be achieved

critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
information with respect to our critical accounting policies that we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments is contained in note to these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances we primarily recognize revenue from customers  including distributors  when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for substantially all sales  revenue is recognized  net of estimated returns and discounts  at the time the product is shipped 
we enter into distribution agreements that permit rights to limited stock rotations  returns  price protection  and volume purchase and other discounts 
we provide an estimated allowance for these rights and record a corresponding reductions in revenue 
our estimated allowance is based on several factors including past history and notification from customers of pending activity 
actual activity under such rights have been within management s expectations 
we also derive a portion of our revenue from fixed price contracts 
revenue for these contracts is recorded under a percentage of completion method  which is based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date to estimated total costs at completion 
gross profit expected to be realized on fixed price contracts is based on periodic estimates of total revenues and costs for each contract 
losses on contracts are accrued when estimated total costs exceed total revenues 
occasionally  we will enter into contracts on a cost plus fee basis 
we recognize revenue based on reimbursements for actual expenses plus the contractually agreed upon fee with the customer 
restructuring charges we recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded and can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability is recorded 
the main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reductions and elimination of excess facilities 
workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability exists  which is generally when individuals have been notified of their expected termination dates and expected severance payments or when formal severance plans exist  when the severance payments are probable and reasonably estimable 
the elimination of excess facilities results in charges for lease termination fees  future contractual commitments to pay lease charges net of estimated sublease income  facility remediation costs and moving costs to remove property and equipment from the facilities 
we recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises or ceased use of the facility 
stock based compensation compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights was calculated based on the grant or assumption date using the black scholes pricing model 
all stock appreciation rights we have granted or assumed are stock settled 
stock options and stock appreciation rights are granted at exercise prices equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
assumed stock options and stock appreciation rights are granted at exercise prices determined in accordance with the acquisition agreement 
expected life was estimated based on historical exercise data that was stratified between members of the board of directors  executive employees and all other recipients 
expected volatility was estimated based on historical volatility using equally weighted daily price observations over a period approximately equal to the expected life of each option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on us treasury securities with an equivalent remaining term 
no dividends are expected to be paid 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards was calculated based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if a participant does not meet length of service requirements 
performance stock units granted in will vest based on the company growth in net sales and earnings per share subject to certain adjustments for and in comparison with the growth in net sales and adjusted earnings per share over the same period for a peer group selected by the compensation committee 
for these performance stock units  of each performance based award opportunity will be subject to the net sales metric for the performance period and will be subject to the earnings per share metric for the performance period 
performance stock units granted in will vest based on the company achieving net sales and earnings per share subject to certain adjustments levels for  and for these performance stock units  of each performance based award opportunity will be subject to the net sales metric for the performance period and will be subject to the earnings per share metric for the performance period 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we recognize uncertain tax positions when they meet a more likely than not threshold 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 
we file us federal  state  and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
fiscal years to generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities 
in significant foreign jurisdictions  the to tax years generally remain subject to examination by tax authorities 
we establish liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including  but not limited to  international tax issues and certain tax credits 
we are currently undergoing an internal revenue service examination as well as certain state examinations 
there have been no significant proposed adjustments to date 
we do not believe the results of any audits would have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we will continue to monitor the status of these audits 
segment information we use the management approach for segment disclosure  which designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments 
we manage our business on the basis of one reportable segment  as a manufacturer of semiconductors in different geographic areas  including the united states  europe and asia 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the accounts receivable amount shown in the balance sheet are trade accounts receivable balances at the respective dates  net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based in part on our historical write off experience and specific review of account balances due 
past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis by type of receivable 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
to date  our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been within management s estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate the carrying value of our inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price we expect to obtain for our products in their respective markets 
we also evaluate the composition of our inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete products 
additionally  inventory write downs are made based upon such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than their cost  which is further reduced by related selling expenses 
the net realizable value of our inventories for ongoing operations has generally been within management s estimates 
we have recorded inventory write downs for discontinued product lines that did not meet gross margin targets  products that are being migrated to newer generations  products that service the large capital spending end markets for which demand has declined  products related to facility closures and losses related to flooding of a facility in thailand 
fair value of financial assets and liabilities accounting standards codification asc permits entities to elect the fair value option for certain financial assets and financial liabilities 
for financial assets or financial liabilities for which an entity elects the fair value option  asc requires that the entity record the financial asset or financial liability at fair value rather than at historical cost with changes in fair value recorded in the income statement 
asc requires that upfront costs and fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected shall be recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred 
as further discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we elected the fair value option in accounting for the term loan balance outstanding as of october  following the extinguishment of the term loan in conjunction with our acquisition of zarlink  we did not elect the fair value option and are reporting new term loan balances subsequent to october   at par value 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition including manufacturing plant closures 
a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset 
significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions 
current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets within the asset group over their fair value is recorded 
the appropriate asset group is determined based on the lowest level of largely independent cash inflows and outflows for the related assets 
depending on the nature of the primary assets in the asset group  fair value is estimated using one of several approaches including replacement cost  appraised values  market quotes or estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved 
during  we recorded a held for sale impairment of million related to the real estate and building for our closed manufacturing facility in broomfield  colorado and a held and used impairment of million for the closure of our manufacturing facility in scottsdale  arizona to reflect our long lived assets at their lower fair value 
future impairments may be required if we close other manufacturing sites 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill on an impairment only approach and amortize intangible assets with definite useful lives over the benefit period  which approximates straight line expense over the respective useful lives 
we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset such as goodwill is impaired as the basis for determining whether a quantitative impairment test is required 
we assess definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
whenever we determine that there has been an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we will record an impairment charge against earnings 
we operate as one reporting unit and an impairment charge would equal the excess of the carrying value of goodwill in our one reporting unit over its then fair value 
the identification of intangible assets and determination of the fair value and useful lives are subjective in nature and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets can significantly affect net income 
we completed our most recent qualitative analysis during the fourth quarter of and noted no significant factors existed during the fiscal year to indicate that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
results of operations net sales decreased million or  to million for from billion for net sales increased million or  from million for for and  we estimate that between to and to  respectively  of net sales were derived from acquisitions concluded in each such fiscal year and each end market benefited from products we added from recent acquisitions 
estimated sales by end markets are based on our understanding of end market uses of our products 
an estimated breakout of net sales by end markets is approximately as follows amounts in thousands aerospace communications defense security industrial total net sales in the aerospace end market decreased million to million in from million in and increased million between and from million in while we believe that we are benefiting from significant content growth on newer aircrafts  net sales were impacted by irregular order rates that we attribute to oems and subcontractors filling their channels to prepare for production and then slowing as manufacturing begins 
in addition  during the second quarter of  sales of space level products were adversely impacted by longer lead times affecting the timing of sales  sales of space level products have recovered in subsequent quarters  which contributed to a sequential net sales increase in this end market for the fourth quarter of during and  we noted an increase in robust demand and order rates for commercial aircraft at aircraft manufacturers and tier one suppliers  growing electronic content in current aircraft  refurbishment programs for older aircraft and demand for the high reliability radar and avionics solutions we provide 
this growth followed a period where this end market was negatively impacted by global economic conditions 
growth in was offset by a slowdown in satellite billings in the beginning of the year though we have experienced increases in recent satellite order activity  which we believe is a reflection of our product portfolio  especially in system level products  power management  and programmable logic ics 
generally space related applications are in a less economically sensitive market  but due to higher average selling prices and our significant dollar content in satellite applications  this end market can fluctuate on a quarterly basis based on the timing of shipments 
net sales in the communications end market decreased million to million in from million in and increased million between and from million in while this end market benefited from increased contributions of voice circuit and timing and synchronization products in and  our overall communications end market is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and capital expenditure deployment  which resulted in a decline in net sales in during the first half of  poe  power management  rf and voice circuit products were especially impacted by macroeconomic factors  further impacting results 
the increase in net sales during was due primarily to the contributions of voice circuit and timing and synchronization products of microsemi cmpg while net sales in benefited from our acquisition of microsemi soc 
both and net sales also benefited from steady sales increases in our power management and conversion solutions 
we expect to continue expanding our market opportunity in timing and synchronization products and believe we are well poised for growth  as a result of new product acceptance as well as expectations for an increase in telecommunications carrier spend on these products 
we expect net sales in the communications end market to benefit from market share gains and market expansion in poe and network synchronization  with continued steady growth from our existing timing and synchronization products 
while we expect unfavorable macroeconomic conditions to affect this end market in the upcoming quarter  we believe that the strength of our timing and synchronization and wireless products will result in steady sales growth in the near term 
net sales in the defense security end market increased million to million in from million in and decreased million between and from million 
sales in and uncertainty surrounding the defense budget was reflected in cautious procurement plans of our customers 
sales for were also adversely impacted by the lack of a federal budget through the first quarter of while the uncertainty about the impact of sequestration impacted overall defense spending  this end market has grown steadily over the last year 
we believe the most recent budget emphasizes command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance and equates to growing electronic content 
further  sales in this end market benefited from contributions from the ramping of millimeter wave scan subsystems used in whole body scanners  missile defense and military rf applications 
we also believe that net sales benefited from increasing international defense sales  enabled in part by our security product offerings  and that microsemi dollar content in defense programs will increase as our products move up the value chain 
we believe the departments of defense and homeland security budgets for electronic content  an area of microsemi focus  will continue to expand and contribute to growth in this end market 
we believe that net sales have benefited from our industry leading technology breadth and total solutions approach and as a result  we are currently bidding for more potential dollar value than any time in our past 
we recognize that the current uncertainty surrounding the us federal budget and sequestration may result in short term delays in defense programs but believe in our long term growth prospects for this end market 
net sales in the industrial end market increased million to million in from million in and increased million between and from million 
during  bookings were steady for medical  semiconductor capital equipment  industrial lasers  mri and other broadline industrial applications while bookings for solar applications increased 
the increase in was due primarily to the contributions of medical products of microsemi cmpg  though we noted growth in plasma cutting and welding applications where our high power proficiency differentiates our products 
we also noted steady contributions from our products for industrial printing  rail transport and precision gps products for surveying 
over the intermediate to longer term  we believe that our differentiated medical products and early design in activity in industrial automation applications will result in growth for this end market 
an estimated breakout of net sales by originating geographic area for  and is approximately as follows amounts in thousands united states europe asia other total gross profit increased million between and  to million of sales for from million of sales for and increased million between and  from million of sales for gross margin improvements resulted from integration and cost improvement activities at both acquired and existing locations 
during  we recorded million of acquisition related inventory charges related to manufacturing profit in acquired inventory 
further  we recorded million from an inventory write off related to flooding in thailand  net of insurance recoveries 
these charges did not recur in gross margin for was favorably impacted by higher margin products related to microsemi soc  cost optimization programs  transfer of manufacturing to lower cost and more efficient facilities including the closure of our scottsdale facility and reductions in personnel 
during  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of bridging inventory that we intended to complete at other locations and million for the write off of medical inventory that did not meet our corporate gross margin targets 
also in  we recorded a million charge for scottsdale remediation and fixed assets that we abandoned as part of our scottsdale facility closure and acquisition related inventory charges million related to manufacturing profit in acquired inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million between and to million for from million in and increased million between and from million in while incremental costs from recent acquisitions contributed to increased sg a expenses  increases were offset by cost control measures and a reduction in stock based compensation expense 
we also recorded acquisition related costs of million in and million in that were not incurred in in connection with the relocation of one of our facilities during  we received cash consideration of million and recorded this consideration in selling  general and administrative costs as an offset to incremental costs incurred for the relocation 
we continually update our estimates with respect to our performance stock units 
compared to the estimates used in  our updated estimates had the impact of reducing stock based compensation expense by million for ytd 
research and development expense increased million between and to million in from million in and increased million between and from million in while incremental costs from recent acquisitions contributed to increased research and development expenses  increases were generally offset by cost control measures 
the principal focus of our research and development activities has been to improve processes and to develop new products that support the growth of our businesses 
the spending on research and development was principally to develop new higher margin application specific products  including  among others  our nm process development for next generation programmable products  higher power poe solutions  the continued roadmap development of our industry leading timing synchronization products  our silicon germanium sige rf power amplifier solutions for wireless lan applications  and the ongoing development of gallium nitride gan and silicon carbide sic power management and rf solutions 
amortization of intangible assets decreased million between and to million in from million and increased million between and from million in the decrease in expense in was primarily from the amortization of backlog related to microsemi cmpg that had an amortizable life of one year and the increase in was due primarily to our acquisition of microsemi cmpg 
these amounts include amortization related to acquired completed technology of million for  million for and million for the increases in amortization expense in and reflect amounts related to recently completed acquisitions 
restructuring charges amounted to million in compared to million in and million in the variances relate to the timing and announcement of restructuring activities 
in  we approved consolidation plans that resulted in the closure of our manufacturing facility in scottsdale  arizona scottsdale  which ceased production during the quarter ended april  the scottsdale facility occupied a  square foot leased facility 
employee severance is expected to be paid through facility termination costs relate primarily to remaining obligations under facility and equipment leases and are expected to be paid through the following table reflects the restructuring activities for the scottsdale facility and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the dates below amounts in thousands employee severance facility termination costs total balance at september  reversal of prior provision cash expenditures balance at september  at september   we had recorded severance accruals of million from reductions in force at our various facilities other than scottsdale 
we recorded additional provisions  primarily for severance and retention payments  totaling million in provisions for severance covered approximately individuals in manufacturing  engineering and sales 
employee severance is expected to be paid within the next twelve months 
contract termination costs relate primarily to remaining obligations under facility leases and are expected to be paid through other associated costs related primarily to relocation costs that we incurred for the consolidation of several facilities in northern california 
the following table reflects the related restructuring activities and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the dates below amounts in thousands employee severance contract termination costs other associated costs total balance at september  provisions cash expenditures other non cash settlement balance at september  interest expense was million in  million in and million in between and  the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a lower term loan balance of million at the end of compared to million at the end of the increase in interest expense between and was primarily due to a higher term loan balance  which was million at the end of other expense  net  was million in compared to million in and million in during the second quarter of  we entered into amendment no 
to our credit agreement dated as of november  with mssf and the lenders referred to therein as amended  the credit agreement  which among other things  reduced the interest rate on our term loan to 
we accounted for the fourth amendment as a debt modification with respect to amounts that remained in the syndicate and a debt extinguishment with respect to the million that exited the syndicate and recorded debt extinguishment expense of million 
the amendment did not impact the net principal balance outstanding 
in connection with the original credit agreement  in  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of minimizing the variability of cash flows in the interest rate payments of our variable rate borrowings 
in connection with the acquisition of zarlink  we entered into a foreign currency forward agreement during q to minimize our foreign currency risk associated with the transaction that we funded in canadian dollars 
we reflected the change in fair value of our term loan balances  swaps and forward contract through other income or expense 
we recorded income of million during the first quarter of related to these adjustments 
during the first quarter of  we amended our credit facility and accounted for the amendment as a debt extinguishment 
accordingly  we recorded million in debt extinguishment costs in other income expense 
during the second quarter of  we further amended our credit facility and accounted for this amendment as a debt modification with respect to amounts that remained in the syndicate and a debt extinguishment with respect to amounts that exited the syndicate 
as such  we immediately expensed million in financing costs related to the debt extinguishment 
subsequent to the amendment in the first quarter of  we did not elect the fair value option on our outstanding term loan balances 
in  we elected the fair value option in accounting for the term loan balance outstanding under our credit agreement and changes in fair value of the loan balances are reflected as adjustments to the income statement 
in connection with the credit agreement  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of minimizing the variability of cash flows in the interest rate payments of our variable rate borrowings 
in connection with the acquisition of zarlink  we entered into a foreign currency forward agreement in the fourth quarter of to minimize our foreign currency risk associated with the transaction that we funded in canadian dollars cad 
we reflect the change in fair value of our term loan balances  swaps and forward contract through other income or expense 
we recorded expense of million related to these adjustments 
in addition  upon election of the fair value option  we were required to immediately expense up front debt issuance and refinancing costs that totaled million in finally  in we recorded a gain of million related to the sale of a facility 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million on pretax income of million in compared to a provision for income taxes of million on pre tax loss of million in during and  we generated tax expense of million and million  respectively  primarily due to the tax provision on profitable entities in foreign jurisdictions and us tax provision relating to deferred tax liabilities that will not provide future sources of income to realize deferred tax assets 
we had cumulative operating losses for the three years ended in for our us operations and several foreign operations and accordingly  have provided a full valuation allowance on certain of our us and foreign net deferred tax assets as we have determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized in the future 
during we increased the valuation allowance by million  which primarily related to deductions for intangible non goodwill amortization 
during we increased the valuation allowance by million  which primarily related to the acquisition of microsemi cmpg during the quarter ended january   and the recording of the deferred tax assets related to the acquisition 
during we released the remaining valuation allowance related to our israel operation  based on evaluation of key positive and negative evidence including the history of substantial losses in past years but cumulative income for the past three year period  and the indefinite carryforward period for the israeli net operating loss carryforwards which are the principal component of our deferred tax assets in israel 
capital resources and liquidity we had million and million in cash and cash equivalents at september  and september   respectively 
during  we financed our operations with cash generated from operations

during the quarter ended march   we entered into amendment no 
to our credit agreement 
the amendment extended the term loan maturity date  provided new pricing terms  including reducing the interest rate on our term loan to  and modified certain financial covenant provisions such that they are not scheduled to be reported unless we have revolving or swingline loan balances outstanding at the end of a fiscal quarter 
we accounted for the fourth amendment as a debt modification with respect to amounts that remained in the syndicate and a debt extinguishment with respect to the million that exited the syndicate and recorded debt extinguishment expense of million 
the amendment did not impact the net principal balance outstanding 
as of september   we had million in term loan borrowings and no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
under the credit agreement  we may borrow under a base rate which approximates the prime rate or eurodollar rate which approximates libor 
in the case of term loans  the eurodollar rate will not be lower than 
the applicable interest rate margin per annum for each type of loan at september  is as follows base rate eurodollar rate revolving and swingline loans term loans as of september   term loan borrowings were under the eurodollar rate and subject to an interest rate of 
based on the current term loan balance outstanding  a percent change in interest rates would result in a corresponding change to interest expense of million 
the fair value of our term loan balance was million and we classify this valuation as a level fair value measurement 
the amended term loan facility matures in february and principal amortizes at million per year 
during the fiscal year ended september   we completed optional principal prepayments of million 
while there are currently no scheduled principal repayments until the maturity date  the credit agreement stipulates an annual payment of a percentage of excess cash flow ecf 
the ecf percentage is between and depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of a fiscal year 
we currently pay an undrawn commitment fee of on the unused portion of the revolving facility 
if any letters of credit are issued  then we expect to pay a fronting fee equal to per annum of the aggregate face amount of each letter of credit and a participation fee on all outstanding letters of credit at a per annum rate equal to the margin then in effect with respect to eurodollar rate based loans on the face amount of such letter of credit 
the credit agreement includes financial covenants requiring a maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio that are applicable only when revolving loans or swingline loans are outstanding at the end of a fiscal quarter and also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default 
we were in compliance with our covenants as of september  on october   we entered into the merger agreement  pursuant to which  and on the terms and subject to the conditions thereof  pett acquisition corp  a delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of microsemi  commenced a cash tender offer on october  to purchase all of the outstanding shares of symmetricom s common stock at a purchase price of per share 
we estimate that the total amount of funds required to purchase all of symmetricom shares pursuant to the offer and consummate the merger is approximately million 
microsemi expects to obtain the necessary funds from credit facilities for which microsemi has received a commitment letter as described below  alternative financing or existing cash balances 
the tender offer is scheduled to expire on november  also on october   we entered into a commitment letter with mssf pursuant to which mssf has committed to provide a million incremental term loan facility the incremental term facility which was syndicated on november  the incremental term facility is available to i finance the tender offer  ii repay any existing indebtedness of symmetricom following the consummation of the merger  and iii pay fees and expenses related to the merger 
interest under the incremental term facility is  at microsemi s option  base rate or libor  plus a margin of for base rate based loans and for libor based loans with a libor floor 
the covenants under the incremental term facility are consistent with those in our existing credit agreement 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments  excluding liability related to uncertain tax positions  at september  amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years imputed interest credit facility interest on credit facility commitment fee on credit facility interest rate swap payments capital leases other long term liabilities operating leases purchase obligations total as of september   we recorded million in long term liabilities for accrued taxes related to uncertain tax positions and are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term payments  or the amount by which our liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the liability related to uncertain tax positions has not been included in the contractual obligations table 
payments of interest on our credit facility in the contractual obligations table assumes that we will make no further term loan principal payments until the maturity date and incur interest at a rate of per annum 
payments of the commitment fee on credit facility assumes our revolving credit facility remains undrawn 
interest swap payments are based on the current interest rate on our term loan of per annum 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no

asu no 
is effective for public entities for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the second quarter of our fiscal year 
these updates only affect the presentation of comprehensive income and did not materially impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued asu related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various forms of market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in credit risk  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates or the stock market 
we conduct a relatively small portion of our business in a number of foreign currencies  principally the european union euro  canadian dollar  british pound  israeli shekel and chinese rmb 
we may receive some revenues in foreign currencies and purchase some inventory and services in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
because transactions in foreign currencies have represented a relatively small portion of our business  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact historically on our revenues or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have material adverse effects on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
we have not conducted a foreign currency hedging program thus far 
we have considered and may continue to consider the adoption of a foreign currency hedging program 
concentrations of credit risk exists because we rely on a significant portion of customers whose principal sales are to the us government 
approximately of total net sales in were in the defense security end market and sales in this end market highly correlate to customers whose principal sales are to the us government or to subcontractors whose material sales are to the us government 
we  as a subcontractor  sell our products to higher tier subcontractors or to prime contractors based upon purchase orders that usually do not contain all of the conditions included in the prime contract with the us government 
however  these sales are usually subject to termination and or price renegotiations by virtue of their reference to a us government prime contract 
therefore  we believe that all of our product sales that ultimately are sold to the us government may be subject to termination  at the convenience of the us government or to price renegotiations under the renegotiation act 
in addition  the shutdown of non essential us government services in october and any future government shutdowns may significantly increase the risk of contract terminations or renegotiations 
at least one of our contracts was terminated in the past due to the termination of the underlying government contract 
there can be no assurance that we will not have contract termination or price renegotiation in the future  and any such termination or renegotiation could have a material adverse impact upon our revenues and results of operations 
we had one customer that was a distributor of our products  primarily servicing our defense security and aerospace end markets  that accounted for approximately of net sales in  and any disruption with this distributor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  net sales from international markets represent a significant portion of total net sales 
our net sales to international customers represented approximately for  for and for these sales were principally to customers in europe and asia 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have been within management s expectations 
under the credit agreement  we may borrow under a base rate which approximates the prime rate or eurodollar rate which approximates libor 
in the case of term loans  the eurodollar rate will not be lower than 
the applicable interest rate margin per annum for each type of loan at september  is as follows base rate eurodollar rate revolving and swingline loans term loans the amended term loan facility matures in february and principal amortizes at million per year 
during the fiscal year ended september   we completed optional principal prepayments of million 
while there are currently no scheduled principal repayments until the maturity date  the credit agreement stipulates an annual payment of a percentage of ecf 
the ecf percentage is between and depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of a fiscal year 
in connection with the original credit agreement in november  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of minimizing the variability of cash flows in the interest rate payments of our variable rate borrowings 
the cash flows received under the interest rate swap agreements are expected to offset the change in cash flows associated with libor rate borrowings between the effective and maturity dates of the swaps 
our two swap agreements have notional amounts  fixed rates and expiration dates as follows million at expiring january and million at expiring january we classify our interest rate swap balances as level fair value measurements 
we determined the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements based on mid market valuations reported to us by the counterparty to the swap agreements 
related to these interest rate swap agreements  we recorded a current liability of million and a long term liability of million as of september  and a long term liability of million as of september  we reflect the change in fair value of the swaps through other income expense  net and recorded income of million in and income of million in
