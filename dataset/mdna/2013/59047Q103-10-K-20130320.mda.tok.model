item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those identified below and those discussed in the section entitled risk factors included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we provide a virtualized wireless lan solution that is designed to cost effectively optimize the enterprise network to deliver the performance  reliability  predictability and operational simplicity of a wired network  with the advantages of mobility 
our solution represents an innovative approach to wireless networking that utilizes virtualization technology to create an intelligent and self monitoring wireless network 
we sell a virtualized wireless lan solution built around our system director operating system  which runs on our controllers and access points 
we also offer additional products designed to deliver centralized network management  predictive and proactive diagnostics and enhanced security 
we were founded in january with the vision of developing a virtualized wireless lan solution that enables enterprises to deliver business critical applications over wireless networks  and become what we refer to as all wireless enterprises 
from our inception through  we were principally engaged in the design and development of our virtualized wireless lan solution 
we focused on developing technology that could reliably and predictably deliver business critical applications using voice  video and data over wireless networks in dense environments 
we began commercial shipments of our products in december  and initially targeted markets where the wireless delivery of applications in dense environments is critical  such as healthcare and education 
since that time  we have broadened our focus to include organizations in more markets  and have significantly expanded our geographic reach 
to date  our products have been deployed by approximately  customers worldwide in many markets  including education  healthcare  hospitality  manufacturing  retail  technology  finance  government  telecom  transportation and utilities 
we outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products  including all of our access points and controllers  to original design manufacturers and contract manufacturers 
we also outsource the warehousing and delivery of our products to a third party logistics provider in the united states for worldwide fulfillment 
our products and support services are sold worldwide  primarily through value added resellers  or vars  and distributors  which serve as our channel partners 
we employ a sales force that is 
table of contents responsible for managing sales within each geographic territory in which we market and sell our products 
since inception  we have expended significant resources on our research and development operations 
our research and development activities were primarily conducted at our headquarters in sunnyvale  california until  when we significantly expanded our research and development operations in bangalore  india 
in  we began developing products specifically to leverage the capabilities of a new wireless communication standard promulgated by the institute of electrical and electronics engineers  or ieee  the n standard  and began commercial shipments of our n products in the second half of we believe several emerging trends and developments will be integral to the future growth of our business 
the growing number of wireless devices and the increased expectations of the users of these devices are driving demand for better performing wireless networks 
enterprises increasingly view wireless networks as a means to deliver better service to their customers and increase the productivity of their workforce  and as a result  they are shifting from the casual use of wireless networks to the strategic use of wireless networks for business critical applications 
further  enterprises are increasingly realizing that wireless networks designed to optimize the n standard and the planned ac standard can deliver the capacity and performance to support their business critical applications 
our ability to capitalize on emerging trends and developments will depend  in part  on our ability to execute our growth strategy of increasing the recognition of our brand and the effectiveness of our solution  expanding the adoption of our solution across markets  and expanding and leveraging our relationships with the channel partners 
we continue to evolve our entire organization to further capitalize on growth opportunities 
on march   our board of directors appointed dr 
bami bastani  who previously served as the president  chief executive officer  and board member of companies in the mobility  consumer  and broadband markets  as our president and ceo  and a member of our board of directors 
our ability to achieve and maintain profitability as well as our other goals in the future will be affected by  among other things  the continued acceptance of our products  the timing and size of our orders  the average selling prices for our products and services  the costs of our products  and the extent to which we invest in our sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative resources 
our revenues have grown from million in to million in it is difficult to predict our revenues in the near term 
our revenues have in the past fluctuated significantly  and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
further  our revenues during any given quarter depend on multiple factors  including  but not limited to  the amount of orders booked in a prior quarter but not shipped until the given quarter  new orders received and shipped in the given quarter  the amount of deferred revenue recognized in the given quarter and the amount of revenues that meet the accounting standards for revenue recognition 
these factors could impact our revenues significantly in any given quarter 
in addition  we believe that there can be significant seasonal factors that may cause the first and third quarters of our fiscal year to have relatively weaker products revenues than the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors  including customers with a december fiscal year end may choose to spend remaining budgets before their year end resulting in a positive impact on our products revenues in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  the structure of our direct sales compensation program may provide additional financial incentives to our sales personnel for exceeding their annual goals  
table of contents the timing of our annual training for the entire sales force in our first fiscal quarter combined with the above fourth quarter factors can potentially cause our first fiscal quarter to be seasonally weak  many of our education customers have procurement and deployment cycles that can result in stronger order flow in our second fiscal quarter than other quarters assuming the continued availability of traditional funding sources  such as the e rate program in the united states  and seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in the united states  europe and certain other regions may have a negative impact on our third quarter revenues 
we believe that our historical growth  variations in the number of orders booked in a prior quarter but not shipped until a later quarter and other variations in the amount of deferred revenues may have overshadowed the nature or magnitude of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date 
in addition  the timing of one or more large transactions may overshadow seasonal factors in any particular quarterly period 
seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our results of operations in the future 
we have incurred losses since inception as we grew our business and invested in research and development  sales and marketing  and administrative functions 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in april  we entered into a settlement  license and release agreement with extricom 
as part of this agreement  we paid extricom million in in june  we entered into a license agreement with motorola and  as part of which  we paid motorola million in vendor specific objective evidence our recognition of revenues in a particular period depends on the satisfaction of specific revenue recognition criteria  which we describe in more detail below 
we adopted two new accounting standards for certain revenue arrangements at the beginning of fiscal year that include software elements and multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the manner in which we recognize our revenues has changed significantly over time  particularly in and  when we established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for our support services 
these changes have had a significant impact on the timing of when we recognize revenues from sales of our products and services 
generally  upon establishing vsoe for support services for a customer or class of customers  our total recognized revenues from sales to these customers increased in subsequent periods because we were able to recognize all of the products revenues from these sales in these periods once all revenue recognition criteria were satisfied  and we were no longer required to defer the recognition of products revenues over the support period 
we also continued to recognize ratable products and services revenues from sales to customers made prior to establishing vsoe for support services 
this impact will decrease over time as our deferred revenue balance declines from the time we established vsoe for support services 
we recognize the costs of revenues in the same period in which we recognize the associated revenues 
when reviewing our financial performance and making period to period comparisons  you should consider the impact that the timing of the adoption of the two new accounting standards and the establishment of vsoe had on our financial results  including the amount of our revenues and costs of revenues 
key metrics we monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends  establish budgets  measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies 
we discuss product revenues  support and services revenues and the components of operating income below under components of revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses 
table of contents and we discuss our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments under liquidity and capital resources 
fiscal years or as of fiscal years ended dollars in thousands products revenues support and services revenues gross margin products and support and services loss from operations cash and cash equivalents and short term investments net cash used in operating activities includes stock based compensation expense of gross margin products and support and services 
we monitor gross margin to measure our cost efficiencies  including primarily whether our manufacturing costs and component costs are in line with our product revenues and our personnel costs associated with our technical support  professional services and training teams are in line with our support and services revenues 
net cash used in operating activities 
we monitor cash flow from operations as a measure of our overall business performance 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  purchases of inventory  costs related to our facilities and litigation reserve expense 
monitoring cash flow from operations enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non cash effects of certain items such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expenses  accrued interest on long term debt  amortization of issuance costs and warrant expense  thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business 
components of revenues  costs of revenues and operating expenses revenues 
we derive our revenues from sales of our products  and support and services 
our total revenues are comprised of the following products revenues we generate products revenues from sales of our software and hardware products  which primarily consist of our system director operating system running our access points and controllers  as well as additional software applications 
support and services revenues we generate support and services revenues primarily from service contracts for our meru assure customer support program  which includes software updates  maintenance releases and patches  telephone and internet access to our technical support personnel and hardware support 
we also generate support and services revenues from the professional and training services that we provide to our vars  distributors and customers 
ratable products and services revenues prior to january   we recognized ratable products and services revenues from sales of our products and services in circumstances where vsoe for support services being provided could not be segregated from the value of the entire sales arrangement  or where we provided technical support or unspecified software upgrades outside of contractual terms 
in these cases  revenues were deferred and recognized ratably over either the economic life of the product or the contractual period 
as of january   we established vsoe for support services for all our channel partners and customers  and we no longer offer support outside of contractual terms  and therefore  we are able to recognize products revenues and support and services revenues separately 

table of contents deferred revenue 
prior to establishing vsoe for our support services provided to vars  distributors and customers  we recognized the revenues from such sales over either the economic life of the related products or the contractual support period  depending on the party and the time at which the sale occurred 
as such  prior to establishing vsoe for support services sold to vars  distributors and customers  only a small amount of our invoiced products and services within a quarter were recognized as revenues in such quarter  with the majority recorded as deferred revenue 
we established vsoe for support services sold to our channel partners  including vars  distributors and customers  at different times during  and the decreases in deferred revenue due to the related recognition of ratable revenue are partially offset by the sale of support services that will be recognized over the term of the support agreements 
the total deferred revenue as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
costs of revenues 
our total costs of revenues is comprised of the following costs of products revenues a substantial majority of the costs of products revenues consists of third party manufacturing costs and component costs 
our costs of products revenues also include shipping costs  third party logistics costs  write offs for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty costs 
costs of support and services revenues costs of support and services revenues is primarily comprised of personnel costs associated with our technical support  professional services and training teams 
costs of ratable products and services revenues costs of ratable products and services revenues is comprised primarily of deferred costs of products revenues and an allocation of costs of services revenues 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative expenses and litigation reserve expense 
the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  commissions  bonuses and benefits for our employees 
we grant our employees and members of our board of directors equity awards and recognize stock based compensation cost as part of operating expenses 
we expect to continue to incur significant stock based compensation expense as our employee base grows 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel  engineering  testing and compliance  facilities and professional services costs 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we are devoting a substantial amount of our resources to the continued development of additional functionality for our existing products and the development of new products 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily consist of personnel costs  sales commissions  travel costs  cost for marketing programs and facilities costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel  professional services and facilities costs related to our executive  finance  human resource and information technology functions 
professional services consist of outside legal and accounting services and information technology consulting costs 
we have incurred additional accounting and legal costs related to compliance with rules and regulations enacted by the sec  including the additional costs of complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act  as well as additional insurance  investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company 
litigation reserve expense 
litigation reserve expense consists of settlements or anticipated settlements of litigation 
in  the litigation reserve expense was related to the settlement  
table of contents license and release agreement with extricom 
as part of this agreement  we paid extricom million and expensed the full amount in in  we entered into a license agreement with motorola and  as part of which  we agreed to pay motorola million and expensed the full amount in we record litigation accruals for legal matters which are both probable and estimable 
for potential losses for which there is a reasonable possibility meaning the likelihood is more than remote but less than probable that a loss exists  we will disclose an estimate of the potential loss or range of such potential loss or include a statement that an estimate of the potential loss cannot be made 
interest expense  net 
for  interest expense  net consists primarily of interest expense on debt and customer prompt payment discounts 
for and  interest expense  net consists primarily of interest expense on debt  prompt payment discounts and interest income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances 
as of december   we had million of outstanding debt before debt discounts 
other income expense  net 
in and  other income expense  net consists primarily of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
in  other income expense  net consists primarily of charges to record fair value adjustments for our warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock 
until the closing of our initial public offering on april   our outstanding warrants were classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets and any changes in fair value were recognized as a component of other income expense  net 
major channel partners we sell products and services directly to our channel partners  including vars and distributors 
the following table sets forth our channel partners representing greater than of revenues in the periods presented in percentages years ended december  major channel partners westcon group  inc siracom  inc catalyst telecom  inc ingram micro inc less than critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management judgments and estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from hardware and software products and related support and services 
we often enter into multiple deliverable arrangements and as such the elements of these arrangements are separated and valued based on their relative fair value 
the majority of our products are networking communications hardware with embedded software components such that the software functions together with the hardware to provide the essential functionality of the product 
therefore  our hardware deliverables are considered to be non software elements and are excluded from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
our products revenues also include revenues from the sale of stand alone software products 
stand alone software products may operate on our networking communications hardware  but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware 
sales of stand alone software generally include a perpetual license to our software 
sales of stand alone software continue to be subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
product support typically includes software updates on a when and if available basis  telephone and internet access to our technical support personnel and hardware support 
software updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
certain arrangements with multiple deliverables continued to have stand alone software elements that are subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance along with non software elements that are subject to the amended revenue accounting guidance 
the revenue for these multiple deliverable arrangements is allocated to the stand alone software elements as a group and the non software elements based on the relative selling prices of all of the elements in the arrangement using the fair value hierarchy in the amended revenue accounting guidance 
for sales of stand alone software after december  and for all transactions entered into prior to january   we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance 
under the software revenue recognition guidance  we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of all undelivered elements exists 
we establish vsoe for these arrangements based on sales of multi year support services arrangements on a stand alone basis 
the normal pricing for multi year support services arrangements was based on the normal price of a one year support services arrangement multiplied by the number of years of support services which was then adjusted for the time value of money and the decreased sales and fulfillment effort for support service periods of longer than one year 
in the majority of our contracts  the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as products revenues 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when the undelivered element for which we do not have vsoe is support  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
vsoe for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for an element falls within a reasonably narrow pricing range  generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical stand alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range of the median rates 
in addition  we consider major service groups  geographies  customer classifications  and other variables in determining vsoe 
third party evidence of selling price  or tpe  is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
we establish estimated selling prices  or esp  for support services based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for support services 
this esp analysis requires that a substantial majority of the support services selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing 
table of contents range  which is typically broader than the range used to evidence vsoe 
we believe that this is the price that we would sell support services if support services were regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
however  we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of its peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
when we are unable to establish the selling price of our non software elements using vsoe or tpe  we use esp in the allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine esp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  pricing policies  internal costs  gross margin objectives  competitive landscapes  geographies  customer classes and distribution channels 
we regularly review vsoe and esp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 
there was not a material impact during the year  nor do we currently expect a material impact in the near term  from changes in vsoe or esp 
we recognize revenues when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
the sales prices for our products are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement 
delivery is considered to have occurred when product title has transferred to the customer  when the service or training has been provided  when software is delivered  or when the support period has lapsed 
to the extent that agreements contain rights of return or acceptance provisions  revenues are deferred until the acceptance provisions or rights of return lapse 
the majority of our sales are generated through distributors 
revenues from distributors with return rights are recognized when the distributor reports that the product has been sold through  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we obtain sell through information from these distributors 
for transactions with all other distributors  we do not provide for rights of return and recognize products revenues at the time of shipment  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
prior to april   we allowed some customers to receive support services outside of the contractual terms 
accordingly  we deferred and recognized revenues on all transactions  except for transactions with one customer  ratably over the economic life of the products sold as we determined that this was the best estimate of the period of time over which we provided these support services 
the one exception relates to a customer for which we established vsoe for the related support contracts during the year ended december  accordingly  we began to account for these support contracts as separate elements from the hardware sales 
we estimated the economic life of the hardware to be three and a half years based on several factors such as the history of technology development of related products  a company specific evaluation of product life cycles from both a sales and product development perspective  and information on customer usage of our products 
on april   we ceased providing support services outside of the contractual terms 
as a result  we began recognizing ratable revenues from sales in which vsoe for the related support services had not been established over the contractual support period and not the three and a half year economic life of the product 
also on april   we established vsoe for support services to distributors 
accordingly  we recognized revenues from sales to distributors after this date and prior to january  using the residual method  assuming all revenue recognition criteria were met 

table of contents on january   we established vsoe for all remaining support services 
accordingly  we recognized revenues for other than support services for all sales made on and after january  and prior to january  using the residual method  assuming all revenue recognition criteria were met 
revenues for support services are recognized on a straight line basis over the support period  which typically ranges from one year to five years 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in products revenues and the related shipping costs are included in costs of products revenues 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation for equity awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  usually the vesting period  based on the grant date fair value 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options and shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
the determination of the fair value of these awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price  the expected holding period of the awards  the risk free interest rate and the expected stock price volatility 
further  the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation that we are required to record as an expense 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model change significantly  stock based compensation for future awards may differ materially from the awards granted previously 
we account for stock options issued to non employees based on their estimated fair value determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
however  the fair value of the equity awards granted to non employees is remeasured as the awards vest  and the resulting increase in value  if any  is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered 
fair value of financial instruments prior to our ipo  freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock and some of our warrants to purchase common stock were classified as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value because the warrants may have conditionally obligated us to transfer assets at some point in the future 
the warrants were subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date  and any changes in fair value were recognized as a component of other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we estimated the fair value of these warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using the black scholes option pricing model which includes a number of highly judgmental inputs such as the fair value and expected volatility of our common stock 
during the year ended december   we recorded expense of million due to the change in fair value of the warrant liability 
upon the closing of our ipo and amending the common stock warrants  the warrants were no longer considered a liability and the warrant liability was reclassified to additional paid in capital 
we measure the fair value of financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels  as follows level i inputs used to measure fair value are observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets 
level ii pricing is provided by inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly 
we consider the most reliable information available for the valuation of our level ii securities  which includes pricing data from our investment advisors and other independent sources 

table of contents level iii unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data that requires us to develop our own assumptions 
the determination of fair value for level iii investments and other financial instruments involves the most management judgment and subjectivity 
inventory valuation inventory consists of hardware and related component parts and is stated at the lower of cost or fair market value 
we record inventory write downs for potentially excess inventory based on forecasted demand  economic trends and technological obsolescence of our products 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs could be required and would be reflected in costs of product revenues in the period the revision is made 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than anticipated  additional inventory adjustments could be required in future periods 
allowances for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and a detailed assessment of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
to assist with the estimate  our management considers  among other factors  the aging of the accounts receivable  including trends within the age of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the credit worthiness of each purchaser  the economic conditions of the purchaser industry  and general economic conditions 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific purchaser ability to meet their financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due from the customer  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
there is significant judgment involved in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded bad debt expense of  and  there was no bad debt expense during the year ended december  we collected previously written off bad debt expense of  and  during the years ended december  and write offs of previously reserved bad debts were approximately   and  during the years ended december   and income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans 
as of december  and  we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
since inception  we have incurred operating losses  and  accordingly  we have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented other than foreign and state provisions for income tax 
accordingly  there have not been significant changes to our provision for income taxes during the years ended december   or  and we do not expect any significant changes until we are no longer incurring losses 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million and state net operating loss carryforwards of million 
we also had federal and state research credit 
table of contents carryforwards of million and million and foreign tax credits of million 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in and the state net operating losses began expiring in certain jurisdictions in utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation due to applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and state and local tax laws if we have experienced an ownership change in the past  or if an ownership change occurs in the future  including  for example  as a result of the shares issued in our initial public offering aggregated with certain other sales of our stock before or after the offering 
significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are in accordance with applicable tax laws 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  new tax legislation  or the change of an estimate based on new information 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties 
loss contingencies we are or have been subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
we evaluate contingent liabilities  including threatened or pending litigation  for potential losses 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceedings is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based upon the best information available 
for potential losses for which there is a reasonable possibility meaning the likelihood is more than remote but less than probable that a loss exists  we will disclose an estimate of the potential loss or range of such potential loss or include a statement that an estimate of the potential loss cannot be made 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates  which could materially impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows

capital resources we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the next months 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors  including  among other things  market acceptance of our products  the cost of our research and development activities and overall economic conditions 
if our cash sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  we may be required to sell debt or equity securities to raise additional capital or to borrow or increase the amount available to us for borrowing under our credit facility

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued an update for intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the update simplifies the guidance for testing the decline in the realizable value impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill 
the amendments allow an organization the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
an organization electing to perform a qualitative assessment is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the organization determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
the amendments in this update are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents foreign currency risk our sales are denominated in us dollars  and therefore  our revenues are not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk 
our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located  and may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the indian rupee  euro  british pound sterling and japanese yen relative to the us dollar 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts 
during  a appreciation or depreciation in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which our expenses are denominated would not have had a material impact on our earnings  fair values  or cash flows 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these amounts were held primarily in cash deposits  money market funds and us government securities 
cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the risk of interest rate volatility 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future interest income 
during  a appreciation or depreciation in overall interest rates would not have had a material impact on our earnings  fair values  or cash flows
