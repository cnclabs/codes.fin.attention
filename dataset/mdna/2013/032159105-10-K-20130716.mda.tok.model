item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these risks are not the only risks the company faces  and other risks include those not presently known as well as those that are currently considered to be less significant 
major business risks the company s subsidiaries have substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s primary sources of funding for working capital requirements are cash flow from operations  the company s media services banking facility and working capital made available to the company by customers 
the company s liquidity is affected by many factors  including some that are based on normal operations and some that are related to the industries in which the company operates and the economy generally 
the company s media services businesses finance operations in part through a revolving credit facility that matures may  the media services credit facility 
amrep southwest finances its business from cash flow from operations  which has been minimal in recent years due to the poor conditions in its real estate markets  and from advances made to it by its parent 
amrep southwest also has a loan agreement that matures december   which does not allow for additional borrowings 
if the company s media services businesses are unable to extend or renew on similar terms the media services credit facility that expires in may  the media services businesses would be obligated to repay the outstanding balance of the media services credit facility  similarly  if amrep southwest is unable to extend or renew on similar terms the amrep southwest loan that is due in december  amrep southwest would be obligated to repay the outstanding balance of the amrep southwest loan 
if this occurs  the company s media services businesses or amrep southwest  as the case may be  may not be able to fund in full or refinance these obligations at such time absent the company obtaining additional debt or equity funding or raising capital through the sale of assets 
such additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all at such time 
any failure in this regard could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
similarly  the company s media services businesses have operated with negative working capital  at april  primarily through liquidity provided by one significant customer contract that expires june the negative working capital of the company s media services businesses represents the net payment obligation due to this customer and certain other third parties 
on may   the company s newsstand distribution services business  which is part of the company s media services businesses  received notice that this customer contract would not be renewed upon its scheduled expiration in june the company s newsstand distribution services business is evaluating its ability to pay the net payment obligation represented by the negative working capital  as of april  upon expiration of the contract 
the company s newsstand distribution services business currently does not have sufficient capital to fund in full or refinance this obligation  and it may be unable to pay such amount and obtain other sources of working capital absent the company obtaining additional debt or equity funding or raising capital through the sale of assets 
such additional funding or capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
any failure to obtain capital to pay such obligation or to obtain other sources of working capital could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations  these circumstances could also trigger a default under the company s media services credit facility 
in addition  this customer contract represented approximately of revenues for the company s newsstand distribution services business for the year ended april  or less than of the company s consolidated revenues for that period  and the loss of this revenue following the expiration of the contract in june could have a material adverse effect on the company s newsstand distribution services business  financial condition and results of operations 
due to the company s holding company structure  it is dependent on its subsidiaries to distribute funds upstream to the parent company 
amrep corporation is a holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through subsidiaries 
as a holding company  amrep corporation is dependent on distributions of funds from subsidiaries to pay expenses and fund operations 
because of the adverse conditions currently affecting amrep southwest  media services is presently the sole source of funding for the parent company s operations  and the parent company in turn is supplying a substantial portion of the funding needed by amrep southwest 
the continued availability of this funding is dependent upon the results of operations of media services and its continued compliance with the covenants in its revolving credit facility 
the company s overall results of operations  future growth or both would be adversely affected if for any reason media services were unable to distribute sufficient funds to support the operations of the parent company and amrep southwest 
if the cash available for distribution by media services were insufficient to fund the company s consolidated operations and the company was not able to provide the funding needed by amrep southwest  the company would be forced to seek either replacement financing or other sources of capital  such as by selling assets or issuing equity  which replacement financing or other sources of capital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
the media services credit facility requires the borrowers to meet certain covenants  including maintaining a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined 
however  neither meeting a covenant s requirement in the future nor obtaining relief from the lender if it is not met can be assured 
at april   the borrowers were in compliance with the covenants of the media services credit facility 
at april   the borrowing availability under the media services credit facility was  and there was  outstanding against this availability 
the highest amount borrowed during the year ended april  was  under the terms of the media services credit facility  in the event of any future non compliance  the media services business would be barred from repaying indebtedness to or otherwise distributing funds to the parent company and the lender would be entitled to terminate the media services credit facility and seek immediate payment of any outstanding borrowing 
the company s defined benefit pension plan is currently substantially underfunded and will require additional cash contributions  some of which are likely to be accelerated 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the company s defined benefit pension plan was underfunded at april  by  although the company froze the pension plan effective march   so that from that date there would be no new participants in the plan and the existing participants future compensation would not affect their pension benefits  the plan remains underfunded 
a key assumption underlying the actuarial calculations for the pension plan is an assumed annual investment rate of return of 
if the pension plan assets do not realize this expected rate of return  or if any other assumptions underlying the actuarial calculations are incorrect or are modified  the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plan beyond current requirements  which could negatively impact the company s limited financial resources 
in addition  due to the closing of certain facilities in connection with the consolidation of the company s subscription fulfillment services business and the associated work force reduction  the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  and the regulations thereunder  have given the pension benefit guaranty corporation the pbgc the right to require the company to accelerate the funding of  of accrued pension related obligations to the pension plan 
in august  the company and the pbgc reached an agreement with respect to this funding obligation  and as a result  the company made a  cash contribution to the pension plan on august  the agreement also provided that if  before august   the company is unable to pay the remaining  liability or adequately secure it with collateral acceptable to the pbgc  the company would be required to either i provide a letter of credit equal to of the remaining liability or establish a cash escrow for of the remaining liability  to be maintained for five years or until the remaining liability is discharged  if sooner or ii discharge the remaining liability in quarterly installments over a five year period and secure it with collateral acceptable to the pbgc 
in the event the company fails to meet the terms of the agreement  the pbgc could seek immediate payment of the amount due or attempt to force a termination of the pension plan 
although the company is currently having discussions with the pbgc about a comprehensive restructuring of this  payment obligation  the company is unable to offer any assurance that it will be able to discharge the pension plan funding obligation by august  or otherwise meet the pbgc s requirements for securing or paying the undischarged amount  and the company cannot offer any assurance that upon such inability it will be able to negotiate with the pbgc to obtain further relief 
in addition  the company may become subject to additional acceleration of its remaining accrued pension related obligations to the pension plan if the company closes certain additional facilities and further reduces its work force 
any such acceleration could negatively impact the company s limited financial resources and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
the company has incurred significant historical losses and cannot assure shareholders that the company will be profitable in the near term or at all 
the company has incurred significant historical losses  including net losses of   and  for the fiscal years ended april   and  primarily due to highly competitive conditions in the media services businesses and the absence of meaningful real estate development and building activity after in the markets where amrep southwest owns real estate 
the company cannot assure shareholders that the economic or operating conditions affecting either of its principal businesses will improve or that the company will return to profitability in the near term or at all 
risks related to the company s media services operations the introduction and increased popularity of alternative technologies for the distribution of news  entertainment and other information and the resulting shift in consumer habits and advertising expenditures from print to other media has adversely affected the company s media services operations 
revenues in the company s media services operations are principally derived from services the company performs for traditional publishers 
historically  a reduction in the demand for the company s newsstand distribution services due to lower sales of magazines at newsstands has often been at least partially offset by an increase in demand for the company s subscription fulfillment services as consumers affected by the reduction in newsstand distribution instead sought publications through subscription 
however  technology changes  particularly digital technology used in the entertainment and media industries  continue to evolve rapidly  and advances in that technology have led to alternative methods for the distribution  storage and consumption of content such as that contained in the products distributed by the company s media services operations 
these technological changes have driven and reinforced changes in consumer behavior as consumers increasingly seek control over when  where and how they consume content 
for example  the distribution of news  entertainment and other information via the internet has become very popular  and consumers increasingly rely on electronic tablets and readers  personal computers  cellular phones and other electronic devices for such information 
the resulting reduction in demand for traditional print media and the shift of advertising dollars from traditional print media to online media has adversely affected the publishing industry in general and has had a negative impact on both the company s subscription fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services businesses 
the company s failure or inability to adapt to emerging technologies and changes in consumer behavior could have a significant adverse effect on the company s competitive position and its businesses and results of operations 
the company s operating results depend in part on successful research  development and marketing of new or improved services and data processing capabilities and could suffer if the company is not able to continue to successfully implement new technologies 
the company s media services businesses operate in highly competitive markets that are subject to rapid change  and must therefore continue to invest in developing technologies and improving various existing systems in order to remain competitive 
there are substantial uncertainties associated with the company s efforts to develop new technologies and services for the subscription fulfillment and newsstand distribution markets the company serves  including the company s lack of financial resources 
particularly in the subscription fulfillment services business  the company would need to make substantial capital investments in order to convert the company s business to newer digital and internet based technologies 
some of the company s competitors have already adjusted their businesses for the growing digital market and any improvements the company makes may not be developed until it is too late to compete effectively 
additionally  the cost and expertise needed to develop these new digital and internet based technologies may be prohibitive for the company  and even if the company makes significant investments in new information processing technologies and services in these or other areas  they may not prove to be profitable 
the failure or inability to successfully develop or employ new technologies and services could have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position and its businesses and results of operations 
even if these developments are profitable  the operating margins resulting from their application would not necessarily equal  or result in an improvement over  the company s historical margins 
the company s media services operations could face increased costs and business disruption from instability in the newsstand distribution channel 
the company s newsstand distribution services business operates a national distribution business that relies on wholesalers to distribute magazines to newsstands and other retail outlets 
a small number of wholesalers are responsible for a substantial percentage of the wholesale magazine distribution business in the united states  and the company extends credit to such wholesalers  whose credit worthiness and financial position may be affected by changes in economic or other external conditions 
in recent years there has been instability in the wholesaler channel that has led to one major wholesaler abandoning the business and to certain disruptions to magazine distribution 
in addition  another magazine wholesaler is in the process of restructuring itself after failing to timely meet its payment obligations to certain national distributors 
the company has reserved substantially all of the net accounts receivable due from this magazine wholesaler as an estimate for doubtful accounts  which resulted in a  charge to operations 
there is the possibility of further consolidation among wholesalers  and the insolvency or non payment of its obligations by one or more of these wholesalers would have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  due to the significant concentration in the industry  should there be a disruption in the wholesale channel  it could impede the company s ability to distribute magazines to the retail marketplace 
the company s publisher customers face business pressures from reduced advertising revenues and increased costs for paper  printing and postal rates 
these factors could have a negative effect on their operating income  and this in turn could negatively affect the company s media services operations 
an important source of revenue for the magazine publishing industry  the principal industry the company serves  is advertising 
as a result of the recent economic slowdown  there was a well publicized reduction in advertising at all levels which caused a higher attrition rate of magazine titles than had been previously experienced 
in addition  the company s publisher customers principal raw material is paper 
paper and printing prices have fluctuated over the past several years  and significant increases in paper prices could adversely affect a publisher customer s operating income 
postage for magazine distribution and direct solicitation is another significant operating expense of the company s publisher customers  which primarily use the us postal service to distribute their products 
any softness in advertising revenues or significant increases in paper costs  printing costs or postal rates that publishers are not able to offset could have a negative effect on their operating income and number of titles published  and this in turn could negatively affect the company s media services operations 
almost all of the revenues of the company s newsstand distribution services business are derived from sales made on a fully returnable basis  and an error in estimating expected returns could cause a misstatement of revenues for the period affected 
as is customary in the magazine distribution industry  almost all of the commission revenues of the company s newsstand distribution services business are derived from sales made on a fully returnable basis  meaning that customers may return unsold copies of magazines for credit 
from may  through april   customers ultimately returned for credit approximately of the magazines the company initially distributed 
the company recognizes commission revenues from the distribution of magazines at the time of delivery to the wholesalers  less a reserve for estimated returns that is based on historical experience and recent sales data on an issue by issue basis 
although the company has the contractual right to return these magazines for offsetting credits from the publishers from whom the magazines are purchased  an error in estimating the percentage of returns at the end of an accounting period could have the effect of understating or overstating revenues in the period affected  which misstatement would have to be adjusted in a subsequent period when the actual return information becomes known 
competitive pressures may result in a decrease in the company s media services revenues and profitability 
the subscription fulfillment and newsstand distribution services businesses are highly competitive  and some of the company s competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than the company s 
the company experiences significant price competition in the markets in which it competes 
competition in the company s media services businesses may come not only from other service providers  but also from the company s customers  who may choose to develop their own internal subscription fulfillment or newsstand distribution operations  thereby reducing demand for the company s services 
competitive pressures could cause the company s media services businesses to lose market share or result in significant price erosion that could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company may not be able to successfully introduce new services and data processing capabilities on a timely and cost effective basis 
the success of new and improved services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by the publishers and other customers with whom the company conducts business 
the company s media services businesses are affected  to varying degrees  by technological changes and shifts in customer demand 
these changes result in the transition of services provided and increase the importance of being first to market with new services and information processing innovations 
the company may not have the financial and other resources necessary to successfully and timely develop such services or innovations 
difficulties or delays in the development  production or marketing of new services and information processing capabilities may be experienced  and may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
these difficulties and delays could also prevent the company from realizing a reasonable return on the investment required to bring new services and information processing capabilities to market on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company s operations could be disrupted if its information systems fail  causing increased expenses and loss of sales 
the company s business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its systems and communications capabilities  including the maintenance of customer databases for billing and label processing  and the company s magazine distribution order regulation system 
if a key system was to fail or experience unscheduled downtime for any reason  even if only for a short period  the company s operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
the company s systems could be damaged or interrupted by a security breach  fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar event 
the company has a disaster recovery plan in place  but this plan may not prevent delays or other complications that could arise from an information systems failure 
the company s business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate the company for losses that may occur 
the company depends on the internet to deliver some services  which may expose the company to various risks 
many of the company s operations and services  including order taking on behalf of customers and communications with customers and suppliers  involve the use of the internet 
the company is therefore subject to factors that adversely affect internet usage  including the reliability of internet service providers that from time to time may have operational problems and experience service outages or concentrated attacks from third parties seeking to disrupt commerce 
additionally  as the company continues to increase the services it provides using the internet  the company is increasingly subject to risks related to the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
failure to prevent security breaches of the company s networks or those of its customers  or a security breach affecting the internet in general  could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company is subject to extensive rules and regulations of credit card associations 
the company processes a large number of credit card transactions on behalf of its subscription fulfillment services customers and is thus subject to the extensive rules and regulations of the leading credit card associations 
the card associations modify their rules and regulations from time to time  and the company s inability to anticipate changes in such rules and regulations or in the interpretation or application thereof may result in substantial disruption to its business 
in the event that the card associations or the sponsoring banks determine that the manner in which the company processes certain credit card transactions is not in compliance with existing rules and regulations  or if the card associations adopt new rules or regulations that prohibit or restrict the manner in which the company processes credit card transactions  the company may be subject to substantial penalties and fines and be forced to modify the manner in which it operates  which may increase costs  or to cease processing certain types of transactions altogether  any of which could have a negative impact on the company s business 
changes relating to consumer information collection and use could adversely affect the company s ability to collect and use data  which could harm its business 
public concern over methods of information gathering has led to the enactment of legislation in most jurisdictions that restricts the collection and use of consumer information 
the company engages in the collection and use of consumer information in connection with its clients businesses and the company s growing digital efforts 
further legislation  government regulations  industry regulations  the issuance of judicial interpretations or a change in customs relating to the collection  management  aggregation and use of consumer information could materially increase the cost of collecting that data  or limit the company s ability to provide information to its customers or otherwise utilize telemarketing or e mail marketing or distribute the company s digital products across multiple platforms  and could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company faces government regulation and legal uncertainties related to internet communications  commerce and privacy regulation 
the growth and development of the market for internet commerce and communications has prompted both federal and state laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information including consumer credit and financial information  consumer protection  the content of online publications  the taxation of online transactions and the transmission of unsolicited commercial email  popularly known as spam 
more laws and regulations are under consideration by various governments  agencies and industry self regulatory groups 
although the company s compliance with applicable federal and state laws  regulations and industry guidelines has not to date had a material adverse effect on it  new laws and regulations may be introduced and modifications to existing laws may be enacted that require the company to make changes to its business practices 
although the company believes that its practices are in compliance with applicable laws  regulations and policies  if the company were required to defend its practices against investigations of state or federal agencies or if the company s practices were deemed to violate applicable laws  regulations or policies  the company could be penalized and some of its activities could be enjoined 
any of the foregoing could impact the company s ability to provide services  increase the cost of conducting online activities  decrease the demand for the company s services or lessen the company s ability to effectively market its services  or otherwise materially adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s intangible assets  including customer contracts and relationships  are periodically subject to asset impairment tests for accounting purposes  which may result in the incurrence of non cash impairment charges 
the company periodically evaluates and reviews its intangible assets  including customer contracts and relationships  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
any such impairment charge would be included in the company s results of operations 
the uncertainty of revenue trends in the media services industry  any decline in the company s estimate of revenues recoverable from its customer contracts and relationships  the general decline in the magazine publishing industry  which represents the media services business s primary customer base  the recent recession that impacted the us economy and consumers and the uncertainty about the economy s future may adversely impact the recoverability of the company s intangible assets  including customer contracts and relationships  which may result in non cash impairment charges that could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
risks related to the company s real estate operations the company s real estate assets are concentrated in one market  rio rancho  new mexico  so that the company s results of operations and future growth may be limited or affected by economic changes in that market 
substantially all of the company s real estate assets are located in rio rancho  which is adjacent to albuquerque  new mexico 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the company has been and will be affected by changes in economic conditions that occur in this region from time to time  including regional economic contraction due to  among other things  the failure or downturn of key industries and employers 
the company s results of operations  future growth or both may be further adversely affected if the regional demand for residential and commercial real estate remains at the current historically low levels due to the prolonged severe decline in the real estate market in the greater albuquerque metro and rio rancho areas 
land sales have declined from  acres sold by the company in fiscal to acres sold in fiscal  as builders have slowed the pace of building on developed lots previously purchased from the company in rio rancho and delayed or cancelled the purchase of additional developed lots 
a downturn in the business of rio rancho s largest employer may adversely affect the company s real estate development business there 
intel corporation intel is the largest employer in rio rancho and operates a large semiconductor manufacturing facility there 
although intel has made substantial investments in the rio rancho plant in recent years  the number of employees and on site contractors at the plant fluctuates with the demand for the products produced at the plant 
if intel s presence in rio rancho were to diminish for any reason  such as in response to a downturn in its semiconductor manufacturing business or as a result of the relocation of its operations conducted there to another location  the rio rancho real estate market and the company s land development business would likely be adversely affected 
as rio rancho s population continues to grow  the company s land development activities in that market may be subject to greater limitations than they have been historically 
when the company acquired its core real estate inventory in rio rancho nearly years ago  the area was not developed and had a small population 
as of april   rio rancho was the third largest city in new mexico with a population of approximately  as rio rancho s population continues to grow  the company may be unable to engage in development activities comparable to those the company has engaged in historically 
local community or political groups may oppose the company s development plans or require modification of those plans  which could cause delays or increase the cost of the company s development projects 
in addition  zoning density limitations  slow growth provisions or other land use regulations implemented by state  city or local governments could further restrict the company s development activities or those of its homebuilder customers  or could adversely affect financial returns from a given project  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
much of the company s remaining rio rancho real estate is not in contiguous properties  which may adversely affect the company s ability to sell lots at levels comparable with the levels it experienced prior to the sales downturn 
of the approximately  acres in rio rancho that the company owned at april   approximately  acres were in several areas of contiguous properties that are being developed or are suitable for development  and approximately  acres were in areas with a high concentration of ownership  where the company owns more than of the lots in the area  suitable for special assessment districts or city redevelopment areas that may allow for future development under the auspices of local government 
the balance is in scattered lots  where the company owns less than of the lots in the area  which may require the purchase of a number of adjoining lots to create tracts suitable for development or that the company may offer for sale individually or in small groups 
as the company s land sales continue and the number of the company s contiguous and highly concentrated lots diminishes  the company s ability to continue to be in a position to sell lots and generate land sale revenues at satisfactory levels may be adversely affected  which would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s real estate assets are diminishing over time  meaning long term growth in the company s real estate business will require the acquisition of additional real estate assets  possibly by expanding into new markets 
substantially all of the company s real estate revenues are derived from sales of its core inventory in rio rancho  new mexico 
this property was acquired nearly years ago  and each time the company develops and sells real estate to customers in rio rancho  these real estate assets diminish 
as of april   the company owned approximately  acres in rio rancho out of an original purchase of approximately  acres 
the continuity and future growth of the company s real estate business  if the company pursues such growth  will require that the company acquire new properties in or near rio rancho or expand to other markets to provide sufficient assets to support a meaningful real estate development business 
while the company owns two properties in colorado  the company has not for many years made any significant attempt to identify a development opportunity similar to the one the company has undertaken in rio rancho and has no current plans to do so 
if the company does not acquire new real estate assets  its real estate holdings will continue to diminish  which will adversely affect the company s ability to continue its real estate operations 
the company may not be able to acquire properties or develop them successfully 
if the company elects to pursue and is able to identify real estate development opportunities outside of rio rancho  the success of the company s real estate business will depend in large part upon its ability to acquire additional properties on satisfactory terms and to develop them successfully 
if the company is unable to do so  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
the acquisition  ownership and development of real estate are subject to many risks that may adversely affect the company s results of operations  including risks that the company may not be able to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate developers or investors who may have greater capital or better access to cash than the company  the company may not be able to obtain or renew financing on acceptable terms  or at all  an adverse change in market conditions during the interval between acquisition and sale of a property may result in a lower than originally anticipated profit  the company may underestimate the cost of development required to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property  acquired properties may be located in new markets where the company may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy  a lack of business relationships in the area or unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures  and the company may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions  particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties  into the company s existing operations 
in addition  the company currently has approximately developed lots available for sale in rio rancho 
development activities performed in connection with real estate sales include obtaining necessary governmental approvals  acquiring access to water supplies  installing utilities and necessary storm drains and building or improving roads 
the development of additional lots for sale in rio rancho will require additional financing or other sources of funding  which may not be available 
if the company is unable to obtain such financing  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company s real estate development activities have been primarily limited to a single market  and it may face substantially more experienced competition in acquiring and developing real estate in new markets 
since the company s real estate acquisition and development activities have been primarily limited to the rio rancho market  the company does not have extensive experience in acquiring real estate in other markets or engaging in development activities in multiple markets simultaneously 
should the company seek to acquire additional real estate in new markets  competition from other potential purchasers of real estate could adversely affect the company s operations 
many of these entities may have substantially greater experience than the company has in identifying  acquiring and developing real estate opportunities in other markets and in managing real estate developments in multiple markets 
these entities may also have greater financial resources than the company has and may be able to pay more than the company can or accept more risk than the company is willing to accept to acquire real estate 
these entities also may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the costs or the geographic concentration of their investments 
this competition may prevent the company from acquiring the real estate assets the company seeks  or increase the cost of properties that the company does acquire 
competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to the company or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell 
the company will likely compete for real estate investment opportunities with  among others  insurance companies  pension and investment funds  partnerships  real estate and housing developers  investment companies  real estate investment trusts and owner occupants 
properties that the company acquires may have defects that are unknown to the company 
although the company would expect to perform due diligence on prospective properties before they are acquired  and on a periodic basis after acquisition  any of the properties the company may acquire may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to the company that could adversely affect the property s value or revenue potential or  in the case of environmental or other factors  impose liability on the company  which could be significant 
competition from other developers and land owners may adversely affect the company s ability to sell lots and generate land sale revenues at satisfactory levels 
the real estate business is highly competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with many developers and land owners of varying sizes ranging from local to national level businesses to complete land transactions 
these developers and land owners may have greater financial  marketing  sales and other resources than those of the company 
the potential parties interested in the company s land holdings are primarily residential and commercial developers and commercial businesses and competition for these transactions is based on  among other things  price  location  land use  optionality of land use  and other development activities in the surrounding area 
given the geographic concentration of the company s real estate assets in rio rancho  which is adjacent to albuquerque  new mexico  the company is subject to competition from land development in these areas 
three large real estate parcels not owned by the company are under development in albuquerque and rio rancho that will result in additional competition for the sale of the company s developed lots 
competition with other developers and land owners in rio rancho and albuquerque may adversely affect the company s ability to sell lots and generate land sale revenues at satisfactory levels  which would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company is subject to substantial legal  regulatory and other requirements regarding the development of land  including obtaining government approvals  which may be delayed or denied  and therefore the company may encounter difficulties in obtaining entitlements on a timely basis  which could limit its ability to sell land 
there are many legal  regulatory and other requirements regarding the development of land  which may delay the start of planned development activities  increase the company s expenses or limit the company s customers development activities 
development activities performed in connection with real estate sales include obtaining necessary governmental approvals  acquiring access to water supplies  installing utilities and necessary storm drains and building or improving roads 
numerous local  state and federal statutes  ordinances and rules and regulations  including those concerning zoning  resource protection and the environment  regulate these tasks 
these regulations often provide broad discretion to the governmental authorities that regulate these matters and from whom the company must obtain necessary approvals 
the approval process can be lengthy and delays can increase the company s costs  as well as the costs for the primary customers of the company s real estate business residential and commercial developers 
failure to obtain necessary approvals on a timely basis may significantly adversely affect the company s real estate development activities and its results of operations 
the company may be subject to environmental liability 
various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners and operators for the costs of investigating  cleaning up and removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property 
in the company s role as a property owner or developer  the company could be liable for such costs 
this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether the company knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
if the company fails to disclose environmental issues  it could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of the property 
in addition  some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs incurred by the government in connection with the contamination 
if the company incurs any such liability that is material  its results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected 
increases in taxes or governmental fees may increase the company s costs 
also  adverse changes in tax laws could reduce customer demand for land for commercial and residential development 
increases in real estate taxes and other local governmental fees  such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools  open space and road improvements or to provide low and moderate income housing  would increase the company s costs and have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
municipal and state resources have been particularly strained as a consequence of the economic downturn that began in and as a result  many governmental entities have adopted significant tax increases 
the company cannot control these tax increases and may not be able to pass such increased costs on to purchasers  particularly as it generally holds properties for many years 
in addition  further increases in local real estate taxes or changes in income tax laws that would reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives related to real estate would increase the company s expenses and could adversely affect homebuilders potential customer demand and could adversely affect the company s future land sales to those homebuilders 
unless the city of rio rancho supplements its current water supply  development of the company s remaining rio rancho land may be adversely affected 
all of the company s future rio rancho land development will require water service from the city of rio rancho or from another source 
while the city has not denied any development in the past due to a shortage of water supply  it has expressed concerns that its current water supply cannot support growth indefinitely 
although the city is currently pursuing various methods to supplement its water supply  if it is unsuccessful  development of the company s remaining rio rancho land could be restricted or adversely affected 
real estate is a cyclical industry  and the company s results of operations could be adversely affected during cyclical downturns in the industry 
during periods of economic expansion  the real estate industry typically benefits from an increased demand for land 
in contrast  during periods of economic contraction  the real estate industry is typically adversely affected by a decline in demand for land 
for example  increased rates of residential mortgage defaults that began in early calendar led to significant losses for the companies holding such mortgages and contributed to a severe and continuing downturn in the residential housing market 
further  real estate development projects typically begin  and financial and other resources are committed  long before such projects come to market  which could be during a time when the real estate market is depressed 
there can be no assurance that an increase in demand or an economic expansion will occur or be sustained in the rio rancho market  where the company s core real estate business is based and operates  or in any new market into which the company may expand its real estate operations 
any of the following among other factors  including those mentioned elsewhere in these risk factors could cause a general decline in the demand for residential or commercial real estate which  in turn  could contribute to a downturn in the real estate development industry that could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations periods of general economic slowdown or recession  change or uncertainty in government regulation  rising interest rates or a decline in the general availability or affordability of mortgage financing  adverse changes in local or regional economic conditions  shifts in population away from the markets that the company serves  tax law changes  including potential limits on  or elimination of  the deductibility of certain mortgage interest expense  real property taxes and employee relocation expenses  and uncertainty with respect to these matters  or acts of god  including hurricanes  earthquakes and other natural disasters 
changing credit conditions may adversely affect companies in the real estate industry  which rely upon credit in order to finance their purchases of land from the company 
changes in interest rates and other economic factors can dramatically affect the availability of capital for the company s developer customers 
residential and commercial developers to whom the company frequently sells land typically rely upon third party financing to provide the capital necessary for their acquisition of land 
changes in economic and other external market conditions can and have resulted in the inability of developers to obtain suitable financing  which has  and so long as these circumstances continue will  adversely impact the company s ability to sell land and could force the company to sell land at lower prices  which would adversely affect its results of operations 
changes in general economic  real estate development or other business conditions may adversely affect the company s business and its financial results 
a significant percentage of the company s real estate revenues have historically been derived from customers in the residential homebuilding business  which is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and factors such as the level of employment  consumer confidence  consumer income  availability of mortgage financing and interest rates 
adverse changes in these conditions have decreased demand for homes generally  and may continue to do so  adversely affecting the pricing of homes and in turn the price of land sold to developers  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the real estate that the company holds is periodically the subject of third party appraisals used for accounting purposes  which may result in the incurrence of non cash impairment charges 
the company recently received third party appraisals of real estate inventory that had been sold but was subsequently repossessed take back lots 
when repossessed  take back lots are initially taken into inventory at fair market value less estimated costs to sell  and subsequently evaluated for impairment 
the recently received appraisals resulted in the carrying value of certain take back lots located in rio rancho being adjusted from  to fair value of  resulting in a pre tax impairment charge of  which has been included in the results of operations for the fourth quarter of changes in economic and other external market conditions may further adversely impact the fair market value of the company s real estate inventory  which could lead to additional impairment charges that could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
a number of contracts for individual rio rancho home site sales made prior to require the company to exchange land in an area that is serviced by utilities for land in areas where utilities are not installed 
in connection with certain individual home site sales made prior to at rio rancho  new mexico  if water  electric and telephone utilities have not reached the lot site when a purchaser is ready to build a home  the company is obligated to exchange a lot in an area then serviced by such utilities for the lot of the purchaser  without cost to the purchaser 
although this has not been the case in the past  if the company were to experience a large number of requests for such exchanges in the future  its results of operations could be adversely impacted 
if subcontractors are not available to assist in completing the company s land development projects  the company may not be able to complete those projects on a timely basis 
the development of land on a timely basis is critical to the company s ability to complete development projects in accordance with the company s contractual obligations 
the availability of subcontractors in the markets in which the company operates can be affected by factors beyond the company s control  including the general demand for these subcontractors by other developers 
if subcontractors are not available when the company requires their services  the company may experience delays or be forced to seek alternative suppliers  which may increase costs or adversely affect the company s ability to sell land on a timely basis 
land investments are generally illiquid  and the company may not be able to sell its properties when it is economically or otherwise important to do so 
land investments generally cannot be sold quickly  and the company s ability to sell properties has been and may continue to be affected by market conditions 
the company may not be able to diversify concentration risk or vary its portfolio quickly in response to economic or other conditions 
the company s ability to pay down debt  reduce interest costs and acquire properties is dependent upon its ability to sell the properties it has selected for disposition at the prices and within the deadlines the company has established for each property 
other risks the company may engage in future acquisitions and may encounter difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses  and  therefore  may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions in the time frames anticipated  or at all 
from time to time  the company may seek to grow through strategic acquisitions intended to complement or expand one or more of its businesses or to enable the company to enter a new business 
the success of these transactions will depend in part on the company s ability to integrate the systems and personnel acquired in these transactions into its existing business without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems 
the company may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with the company s operations or in separately managing a new business 
furthermore  the company may not realize the degree of benefits that the company anticipates when first entering into a transaction  or the company may realize benefits more slowly than it anticipates 
any of these problems or delays could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company does not have a chief executive officer 
on january   theodore j 
gaasche  the company s president and chief executive officer  resigned from those positions which he had held since august no successor has been appointed or identified  and the company may continue to operate without a chief executive officer for the foreseeable future 
from january until august  the company also operated without a chief executive officer 
following his resignation as president and chief executive officer  the company s board of directors elected mr 
gaasche as a member of the board of directors and vice chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors 
in the absence of a chief executive officer  the executive committee is charged with the oversight of the company s business between meetings of the board of directors 
however  the executive committee does not function as an executive officer 
without a chief executive officer  the company does not have the benefit of the operational oversight and strategic leadership that a person in that position would normally provide  which may adversely affect the company s business and prospects 
the company s current management and internal systems may not be adequate to handle the company s growth  if any 
to manage the company s future growth  if any  the company s management must continue to improve operational and financial systems and to expand  train  retain and manage the company s employee base 
if the company grows  it will also likely need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel  and its ability to do so will depend upon a number of factors  including the company s results of operations and prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel 
at the same time  the company will likely be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other parties 
if the company s management personnel  systems  procedures and controls are inadequate to support its operations  expansion could be slowed or halted and the opportunity to gain significant additional market share could be impaired or lost 
any inability of the company s management to manage the company s growth effectively may adversely affect its results of operations 
the company s business could be seriously harmed if the company s accounting controls and procedures are circumvented or otherwise fail to achieve their intended purposes 
although the company evaluates its internal controls over financial reporting and its disclosure controls and procedures at the end of each quarter  any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system will be met 
any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company s internal control systems and procedures  or any future acquisitions and their respective internal control systems and procedures  will not result in or lead to a material weakness in the company s internal controls  or that the company or its independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the company s internal controls in the future 
if the company s internal controls over financial reporting are not considered adequate  the company s financial statements could become incorrect or misleading and the company may experience a loss of public confidence  which could subject the company to liability and have an adverse effect on the company s business and the price of the company s common stock 
further  deficiencies or weaknesses that the company has not yet identified could emerge and the identification and correction of those deficiencies or weaknesses could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company s quarterly and annual operating results can fluctuate significantly 
the company has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in its quarterly and annual operating results  which may adversely affect the company s stock price 
future quarterly and annual operating results may not align with past trends as a result of numerous factors  including many factors that result from the unpredictability of the nature and timing of land sales  the variability in gross profit margins and competitive pressures 
changes in the company s income tax estimates could affect profitability 
in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate the company s income taxes 
the company s estimates are based on its interpretation of federal and state tax laws and regulations 
the company estimates actual current tax due and assesses temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period  the company will include the adjustments in the tax provision in its financial statements 
these adjustments could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
the price of the company s common stock in recent years has been volatile and has been subject to above average selling pressure from time to time 
this may make it difficult for shareholders to sell the company s common stock  and the sale of substantial amounts of the company s common stock could adversely affect the price of the company s common stock 
the market price for the company s common stock varied between a high of and a low of per share between may  and april  this volatility may make it difficult for a shareholder to sell the company s common stock  and the sale of substantial amounts of the company s common stock could adversely affect the price of the common stock 
the company believes the price of its common stock has been adversely affected from time to time by above average selling pressure created by institutions that have received charitable gifts of the company s common stock and engaged in selling programs to liquidate such positions 
from october  to may   the company s largest shareholder  nicholas karabots  has donated shares he has beneficially owned representing approximately of the company s outstanding common stock to such institutions 
the stock price may continue to be volatile and subject to significant price fluctuations in response to market and other factors including those mentioned elsewhere in these risk factors  and variations in the company s quarterly and annual operating results  which could be significant  material announcements by the company or the company s competitors  sales of a substantial number of shares of the company s common stock  and adverse changes in general economic or market conditions 
in addition to the factors discussed above  the company s common stock is often thinly traded 
as a result large transactions in the company s common stock may be difficult to execute in a short time frame and may cause significant fluctuations in the price of the company s common stock 
among other reasons  the stock is thinly traded due to the fact that four of the company s shareholders beneficially own a substantial majority of the outstanding common stock 
the average trading volume in the company s common stock on the new york stock exchange over the ten day trading period ending on april  was approximately  shares per day 
this thin trading market  when combined with additional selling pressure  including selling by institutions that receive charitable gifts as described above  can result in overall negative stock price and trading trends  which can last as long as the additional selling pressure continues 
further  there have been  from time to time  significant short positions in the company s common stock  consisting of borrowed shares sold  or shares sold for future delivery  which may not have been borrowed 
any attempt by the short sellers to liquidate their positions over a short period of time could cause significant volatility in the price of the company s common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock  many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
the company has not been involved in any securities class action litigation  however  if the company were to become involved in securities class action litigation in the future  it could result in substantial costs and diversion of the company s management s attention and resources and could harm the company s stock price  business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the broader stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years 
this volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock 
the company has a significant shareholder whose interests may conflict with those of other investors 
the company has a significant shareholder  nicholas g 
karabots  who  together with certain of his affiliates  beneficially owns of the company s outstanding common stock 
because of his significant voting power  this shareholder  who resigned as a member of the company s board of directors effective january   could influence the company to make decisions that might run counter to the wishes of the company s other shareholders 
additionally  mr 
karabots may be able to influence the company s board of directors and management as he including through companies that he controls i is the employer of theodore j 
gaasche  a director on the company s board of directors and vice chairman of the executive committee of the company s board of directors  ii has a commercial relationship with lonnie a 
coombs another member of the company s board of directors who is also a director of a private company owned by mr 
karabots  iii is the father in law of michael p 
duloc  who is the president and chief executive officer of the company s media services businesses and iv is the owner of kappa lending group  llc  a company that holds  of debt of amrep southwest  and which could exert substantial additional control over amrep southwest and the company in the event of certain future breaches or defaults concerning such debt 
in addition  a publishing company owned by mr 
karabots is the largest customer of the company s newsstand distribution services business  as well as a customer of the company s subscription fulfillment services business 
for its fiscal years ended april   the company s revenues from the newsstand distribution and fulfillment services it provided to mr 
karabots publishing company amounted to  which was approximately of the company s consolidated revenues for that period 
for its fiscal years ended april   the company s revenues from the newsstand distribution and fulfillment services it provided to mr 
karabots publishing company amounted to  which was approximately of the company s consolidated revenues for that period 
as a result  mr 
karabots may have business interests with respect to the company that differ from or conflict with the interests of other holders of the company s common stock 
although the company has paid dividends in the past  no dividends have been paid since  the company has no regular dividend policy and can give no assurance of any future dividends 
the company has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock since fiscal year the board of directors has stated that it may consider special dividends from time to time in the future in light of conditions then existing  including earnings  financial condition  cash position  and capital requirements and other needs 
no assurance is given that there will be any such future dividends declared 
certain provisions of oklahoma law and the company s organizational documents may impede or discourage a takeover  which may have a limiting effect on the market price of the company s common stock 
the company is an oklahoma corporation and the anti takeover provisions of its certificate of incorporation and of oklahoma law generally prohibit the company from engaging in business combinations with an interested shareholder  as those terms are defined therein  unless the holders of at least two thirds of the company s then outstanding common stock approve the transaction 
consequently  the concurrence of the company s significant shareholder  mr 
karabots and his affiliates  is needed for any third party other than mr 
karabots and his affiliates to acquire control of the company  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the company s other shareholders 
in addition to this restriction  some other provisions of the company s certificate of incorporation and by laws may discourage certain acts that would involve the company undergoing a fundamental change 
for example  the company s certificate of incorporation and its by laws contain certain provisions that classify the company s board of directors into three classes  each of which serves for a term of three years  with one class being elected each year  and prohibit shareholders from calling a special meeting of shareholders 
because the company s board of directors is classified and the company s certificate of incorporation and by laws do not otherwise provide  section of the oklahoma general corporation act permits the removal of any member of the board of directors only for cause 
these factors could impede a merger  takeover or other business combination involving the company or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for the company s common stock  which could have a limiting effect on the market price of the company s common stock

equity compensation plan information see item of this annual report on form k that incorporates such information by reference from the company s proxy statement for its annual meeting of shareholders 
item selected financial data not required 
item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction for a description of the company s business  refer to item of part i of this annual report on form k 
as indicated in item  the company  through its subsidiaries  is primarily engaged in four business segments the subscription fulfillment services business operated by palm coast data llc palm coast  the newsstand distribution services business and the product packaging and fulfillment services and other businesses operated by kable media services  inc and its subsidiaries kable the businesses operated by palm coast and kable are collectively referred to as media services  and the real estate business operated by amrep southwest inc and its subsidiaries collectively  amrep southwest 
on december   a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of palm coast  fulcircle media  llc fulcircle  acquired certain assets from a third party 
the results of this new subsidiary are included in the subscription fulfillment services business since december  data concerning industry segments is set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the company s foreign sales and activities are not significant 
the following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of those financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include i the determination of revenue recognition for the newsstand distribution services business  which is based on estimates of allowances for magazine returns to the company from wholesalers and the offsetting returns of magazines by the company to publishers for credit  ii allowances for doubtful accounts  iii real estate cost of sales calculations  which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete  iv cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets  goodwill and assets held for sale  v actuarially determined benefit obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosures  vi risk assessment of uncertain tax positions  vii the determination of the recoverability of net deferred tax assets  and viii legal contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the most critical assumptions made in arriving at these accounting estimates include the following newsstand distribution services revenues represent commissions earned from the distribution of publications for client publishers  which are recorded by the company at the time the publications go on sale in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc the publications generally are sold on a fully returnable basis  which is in accordance with prevailing trade practice 
accordingly  the company provides for estimated returns by charges to income that are determined on an issue by issue basis utilizing historical experience and current sales information 
the financial impact to the company of a change in the sales estimate for magazine returns to it from its wholesalers is substantially offset by the simultaneous change in the company s estimate of its cost of purchases since it passes on the returns to publishers for credit 
as a result  the effect of a difference between the actual and estimated return rates on the company s commission revenues is the amount of the commission attributable to the difference 
the effect of an increase or decrease in the company s estimated rate of returns of during any period would be dependent upon the mix of magazines involved and the related selling prices and commission rates  but would generally result in a change in that quarter net commission revenues of approximately  management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by attempting to identify troubled accounts by analyzing the credit risk of specific customers and by using historical experience applied to the aging of accounts and  where appropriate within the real estate business  by reviewing any collateral which may secure a receivable  real estate development costs are incurred throughout the life of a project  and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies  but not yet incurred  asset impairment determinations are based upon the intended use of assets  expected future cash flows and estimates of fair value of assets  benefit obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosures are based upon numerous assumptions and estimates  including the expected rate of investment return on retirement plan assets  the discount rate used to determine the present value of liabilities  and certain employee related factors such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
as of april   the effect of every change in the investment rate of return on retirement plan assets would increase or decrease the pension expense by approximately  per year  and the effect of every change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the subsequent year s pension cost by approximately  the company assesses risk for uncertain tax positions and recognizes the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities  projected company earnings including currently unrealized gains on real estate inventory for the recoverability of net deferred tax assets in the future  and the company is currently involved in legal proceedings which are described in part i  item of this annual report on form k and the company estimates whether the legal proceedings relate to a probable loss and if so  then an estimate of probable loss within a range of potential probable losses is made for accrual in the financial statements 
it is possible that the consolidated financial position or results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an outcome of litigation that is significantly different from the company s assumptions 
the company does not accrue for expected future legal costs for such proceedings 
results of operations year ended april  compared to year ended april  for  the company recorded a net loss of  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  in the results for included pre tax  non cash impairment charges of   after tax  or per share while the results for included a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of   after tax  or per share  with the charges in both years reflecting the write down of certain real estate assets 
the results for also included a fourth quarter reserve for doubtful accounts receivable from a magazine wholesaler of   after tax  or per share 
excluding the impairment charges in both years and accounts receivable reserve in  results for were a net loss of  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  for revenues for were  compared to  in the prior year 
revenues from the company s media services operations decreased from  for to  for magazine publishers are the principal customers of these businesses  and they have continued to be negatively impacted by increased competition from new media sources and weakness in the us economy 
the result has been reduced subscription and newsstand magazine sales  which has caused publishers to close some magazine titles and seek more favorable terms from palm coast and kable and their competitors when contracts are up for bid or renewal 
as a consequence of these and other factors  including customer losses  revenues from subscription fulfillment services operations decreased from  for to  for  which includes  of fulcircle revenues from the acquisition date of december  revenues from newsstand distribution services operations decreased from  in to  in revenues from product packaging and fulfillment services and other increased from  in to  in  due to an increase in revenues from both a temporary staffing business and the product packaging and fulfillment services business 
although there are multiple revenue streams in the subscription fulfillment services business  including revenues from the maintenance of customer computer files and the performance of other fulfillment related activities  including telephone call center support and graphic arts and lettershop services  a customer generally contracts for and utilizes all available services as a total package  and the company would not normally provide ancillary services to a customer unless it is also providing the core service of maintaining a database of subscriber names 
thus  variations in subscription fulfillment services revenues are primarily the result of fluctuations in the number and sizes of customers rather than in the demand for a particular service 
this is also true in the newsstand distribution services business where there is only one primary service provided  which results in one revenue source  the commissions earned on the distribution of magazines 
the company competes with other companies  including three larger companies in the newsstand distribution services business and one larger company in the subscription fulfillment services business  and the competition for new customers is intense in both segments  which results in a price sensitivity that makes it difficult for the company to increase its prices 
revenues from land sales at amrep southwest decreased from  in to  in results for both periods were substantially lower than the company experienced prior to fiscal in its principal market of rio rancho  new mexico  due to the severe decline in the real estate market in the greater albuquerque metro and rio rancho areas that began late in fiscal permits for new home construction in rio rancho have generally declined from fiscal through fiscal although the number of permits issued for new home construction in rio rancho increased from permits in fiscal to permits in fiscal  the company still is confronted with builders using their existing inventories of lots previously purchased from the company in rio rancho and delaying or cancelling the purchase of additional developed lots 
the steep decline in the company s sale of undeveloped land to both builders and investors also reflected these factors 
in rio rancho  the company offers for sale both developed and undeveloped lots to national  regional and local homebuilders  commercial and industrial property developers and others 
the company sold acres of land in  at an average selling price of  per acre compared to acres of land in  mostly undeveloped  at an average selling price of  per acre  reflecting differences in the mix of properties sold in each period

impact of inflation operations of the company can be impacted by inflation 
within the industries in which the company operates  inflation can cause increases in the cost of materials  services  interest and labor 
unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies  operating margins will decrease 
within the land development industry  the company encounters particular risks 
a large part of the company s real estate sales are to homebuilders who face their own inflationary concerns that rising housing costs  including interest costs  may substantially outpace increases in the incomes of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to purchase a new home or sell an owned home 
if this situation were to exist  the demand for the company s land by these homebuilder customers could decrease 
in general  in recent years interest rates have been at historically low levels and other price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s markets  and as a result the company has not found the inflation risk to be a significant problem in any of its businesses
