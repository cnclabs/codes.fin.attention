item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as used in this annual report on form k  the terms we  us  our  broadwind  broadwind energy and the company refer to broadwind energy  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
dollars are presented in thousands unless otherwise stated business overview broadwind provides technologically advanced high value products and services to energy  mining and infrastructure sector customers  primarily in the us our most significant presence is within the us wind industry  although we have increasingly diversified into other industrial markets in order to improve our capacity utilization and reduce our exposure to uncertainty related to governmental policies currently supporting the us wind industry 
our product and service portfolio provides our wind energy customers  including wind turbine manufacturers  wind farm developers and wind farm operators  with access to a broad array of component and service offerings 
outside of the wind market  we provide precision gearing and specialty weldments to a broad range of industrial customers for oil and gas  mining and other industrial applications 
the market for new us wind energy installations is affected by the following factors i economic growth and the associated demand for new electricity generation  ii the cost of competing energy sources  primarily natural gas  iii federal and state level wind development incentives  iv available transmission infrastructure and the proliferation of smart grid technology  and v improvements in wind energy cost competitiveness resulting from the maturation of technologies and services within the wind industry  including increased turbine efficiencies and improved focus on equipment maintenance and reliability 
we continue to execute a diversification strategy for our operations  focusing on increasing sales to industrial customers 
we have actively shifted into servicing the installed fleet of wind turbines and expanded our sales to gearing and specialty weldments for industrial customers  and consequently  our sales associated with new wind turbine manufacturing and installations as a share of our total revenue has declined 
of our total company backlog at the end of  represents industrial customer demand  which is up from in the following table shows our revenue share for each of these channels for the past two years annual revenue new wind installations wind installed base support industrial gearing weldments total wind energy demand was strong in most of  but weakened in the last quarter of the year as the market reacted to the scheduled expiration of the federal production tax credit ptc supporting the us wind industry 
due to the scheduled expiration of the ptc and a trade case affecting imports of wind towers from certain asian countries  a number of competitors  both foreign and domestic  have exited the market or repurposed some of their wind tower production assets 
this has improved the near term balance between supply and demand in the us wind tower industry 
new supporting legislation was approved in early that extended the ptc for new wind projects started in calendar  but there is uncertainty surrounding the timing of receiving potential new component orders as developers re start their investment process 
although we have significantly expanded our weldments revenues  our towers and weldments segment is largely linked to new wind installations 
in late 
table of contents and early we announced that we had won follow on towers orders from two large turbine manufacturers totaling million 
in our gearing segment  we successfully shifted into industrial products for oil and gas  mining and rail customers  however  sales to support the natural gas industry softened in  and we experienced reduced orders and revenues from large customers in our gearing segment 
in our services segment  we expanded sales of loose gearing and rebuilt gearboxes and sales to our largest customers including services and value added products which increase turbine efficiency 
during  we conducted a review of our business strategies and product plans given the outlook for the economy at large  the forecast for the industries we serve and our own business environment 
as a result  we have been executing a restructuring plan to rationalize our facility capacity and our management structure  and to consolidate and increase the efficiencies of our operations 
in  we concluded that our manufacturing footprint and fixed cost base are too large and expensive for our medium term needs 
we are executing a plan to reduce our facility footprint by approximately through the sale and or closure of facilities comprising a total of approximately  square feet through the end of to date  we have reached agreement to close or reduce our leased presence at five facilities and achieve an eventual reduction of approximately  square feet 
the most significant planned reductions relate to of one of our cicero  illinois gearing facilities and our non operational brandon  south dakota tower manufacturing facility the brandon facility 
we believe the remaining locations will be sufficient to support our towers and weldments  gearing  services and general corporate and administrative activities while allowing for growth for the next several years 
these factors have required management to reassess its estimates of the fair value of some of our assets 
we entered into an agreement to sell the brandon facility on february  for more information  refer to note subsequent events in part iv  item in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect to incur restructuring costs associated with the restructuring plan totaling an estimated  of which  has been incurred through the end of costs are expected to include approximately  in capital expenditures and  in expenses  of which approximately  is anticipated to be non cash expenses and  is anticipated to be cash expenses 
net proceeds from associated asset sales  projected to be approximately  will be used to fund cash costs 
we anticipate annual savings going forward of approximately  related to the restructuring 
during  we established a three year  revolving credit agreement with alostar bank of commerce alostar 
in connection with this agreement  alostar advanced funds against our borrowing base  which consists of approximately of eligible receivables and approximately of eligible inventory 
proceeds from the transaction were used to repay certain outstanding indebtedness  including repayment of the outstanding debt associated with the wells fargo ap agreements described below 
under this new recapitalized borrowing structure  borrowings are continuous and all cash receipts are automatically applied to the outstanding borrowed balance 
as a result of this structure  we anticipate that cash balances will remain at a minimum at all times when there are amounts outstanding under the credit line 
as of december   total cash assets equaled we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy the cash requirements associated with  among other things  working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt and lease commitments through at least the next months primarily with current cash on hand  amounts available under our credit line  and cash generated by operations 
our ability to meet financial debt covenants on our debt and other financial obligations will depend on our future financial and operating performance 
if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt  or comply with applicable covenants  we will be in default and  as a result  among other things  our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants except for a fixed charge 
table of contents coverage ratio covenant under our credit agreement with alostar the fccr covenant 
on february   alostar agreed to waive our non compliance with the fccr covenant as of december   and further agreed that we will not be required to be in compliance with the fccr covenant as of march   unless we have completed the disposition of the brandon facility prior to such date 
compliance with the fccr covenant is determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter  absent a further waiver from alostar  we must be in compliance with the fccr covenant as of june  and as of the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter

table of contents in tower revenues 
the  increase in tower revenue represents sales of higher steel content towers  partially offset by a reduction in tower volume shipped in the current year 
in the current year  significant steel costs were included in the vast majority of our towers sales  while in the prior year  fabrication only tower sections represented of our volume 
we estimate that the impact of the reduced share of fabrication only tower sections accounted for approximately  of the increase in tower revenues from the prior year 
towers mw sold decreased  with a decrease in the volume of wind tower sections sold compared to we sold  tower sections during the year ended december   versus  sections sold during the year ended december  towers and weldments segment operating income declined by  from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december  the decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to a lower margin mix of tower sales  the decrease in wind tower sections manufactured  and operating inefficiencies related to new tower and weldments design production start up in the current year period

the challenges in the wind industry depressed the manufacture of wind turbine gearing  which had typically accounted for the majority of our gearing revenues in the recent past 
as demand for wind gearing decreased  we increased our sales force and shifted our focus to the manufacture of custom engineered gearing systems and gearboxes for oil and gas  mining and other industrial customers 
gearing sales to oil and gas  mining and other industrial customers in represented of our total revenues  and orders from these customers represented of our backlog as of december  gearing segment operating loss improved by  from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december  the operating margin improvement is due to both improved gross margin due to improved mix despite increased restructuring cost of goods sold of  and by lower sg a expenses 
the sg a expenses reduction was primarily due to reduced legal and professional fees of  lower bad debt expense of and lower employee compensation of the sg a expense reduction was partially offset by increased intangible amortization of related to our decision to shorten the useful life associated with a portion our customer relationship asset  increased restructuring expense of  and increased selling costs of gearing operating margin was during the year ended december  compared to during the year ended december   due to these factors

table of contents in the improvement was primarily attributable to increased tower and gearing sales volumes and a higher margin mix of gearing sales 
partly offsetting the increase were the impact of more competitive pricing within towers and weldments and higher facility costs within services due to the start up of the abilene service facility which operated at a low utilization level during sg a expenses decreased from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december   as a reduction in employee compensation costs was partially offset by  in increased legal costs 
we review our goodwill balances for impairment on at least an annual basis and review our intangible and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset carrying value amount may not be recoverable 
during the second quarter of we identified a triggering event associated with the continued deterioration in the financial performance within our services segment 
this triggering event required a revision of our projection of future operating results and cash flows for this segment in light of the continued economic weakness in the wind energy industry 
we performed our review of goodwill based on the carrying value of these assets as of june   and the estimate of fair value for each of our operating segments was based primarily on projected future results  cash flows and other assumptions 
as a result of this review  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  at june  in our services segment 
during the fourth quarter of  we identified triggering events associated with our current period operating losses  our history of continued operating losses and our revised projections of operating results and cash flows developed as part of the strategic planning process 
as a result  our review of other long lived assets indicated that the carrying values of customer relationships  trade name and property and equipment within our services segment were also impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge during the fourth quarter of  in addition  following our strategic planning meetings that took place in the fourth quarter  we determined that the brandon facility was impaired and recorded an impairment charge to fixed assets of  during  we identified triggering events associated with our current period operating losses combined with our history of continued operating losses 
as a result  we evaluated the recoverability of certain of our identifiable intangible assets and certain property and equipment assets 
we did not record any corresponding impairment in intangible amortization expense decreased from  during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the decrease was due to a lower asset base because of the impairment charges noted above 
we recorded restructuring costs of in sg a expenses in  primarily due to the closure of our european sales office and subsidiary 
we also recorded in other restructuring costs related primarily to losses on the sale of surplus equipment 
total other income  net  was an expense of during the year ended december   compared to other expense  net  of during the year ended december  the net improvement was a result of increased grant income associated with local economic development initiatives partially offset by the restructuring costs mentioned above 
during the year ended december   we reported a benefit for income taxes of  compared to a provision for income taxes of during the year ended december  the decrease in income tax benefit and increase in income tax provision for compared to was primarily attributable to the accrual of state income taxes in and the one time reduction of deferred income tax liabilities in connection with reversal of naked tax credits during net loss from continuing operations decreased from  during the year ended december   to  during the year ended december   primarily as a result of the factors as described above

summary of critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents we have identified the accounting policies listed below to be critical to obtain an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
this section should also be read in conjunction with note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in part iv  item in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these and other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  transfer of title has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred per the terms of the contract 
customer deposits and other receipts are deferred and recognized when the revenue is realized and earned 
in some instances  typically within our towers and weldments segment  products are sold under terms included in bill and hold sales arrangements that result in different timing for revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under these arrangements only when the buyer requests the arrangement  a fixed schedule for delivery exists  the ordered goods are segregated from inventory and not available to fill other orders and the goods are complete and ready for shipment 
assuming these required revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue is recognized upon completion of product manufacture and customer acceptance 
warranty liability we provide warranty terms that generally range from one to seven years for various products and services relating to workmanship and materials supplied by us 
in certain contracts  we have recourse provisions for items that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid to customers under warranty provisions 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we have recorded a reserve for excess of cost over market value in our inventory allowance 
market value of inventory  and management judgment of the need for reserves  encompasses consideration of other business factors including physical condition  inventory holding period  contract terms  and usefulness 
inventories are valued based either on the first in  first out fifo method  or on a standard cost basis that approximates the fifo method 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
raw materials consist of components and parts for general production use 
work in process consists of labor and overhead  processing costs  purchased subcomponents  and materials purchased for specific customer orders 
finished goods consist of components purchased from third parties as well as components manufactured by us that will be used to produce final customer products 
intangible assets we test intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our assets may not be recovered 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units 
recoverability is measured by comparing the assets carrying amounts to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to intangible assets 

table of contents long lived assets we review property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to property and equipment and other long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes based upon an asset and liability approach 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities versus the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
under this method  deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the impact of tax rate changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year that the change is enacted 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize the expected future income tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards as deferred income tax assets 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
we also account for the uncertainty in income taxes related to the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
we follow the applicable pronouncement guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition related to the uncertainty in these income tax positions 
recent accounting pronouncements we review new accounting standards as issued 
although some of the accounting standards issued or effective in the current fiscal year may be applicable to us  we believe that none of the new standards have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 

table of contents liquidity  financial position and capital resources at december   cash assets totaled  compared to our cash assets which totaled  at december  on august   we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with alostar  providing us with a new  secured credit facility as more fully described below  the credit facility 
in connection with consummation of the credit facility  the company wholly owned subsidiaries brad foote gear works  inc brad foote  broadwind services  llc broadwind services and broadwind towers  inc broadwind towers collectively  the subsidiaries used proceeds of the credit facility to repay all outstanding obligations under the credit facility established pursuant to the wells fargo ap agreements 
in connection with this repayment  which included a termination fee  the ap agreements were terminated 
under this new recapitalized borrowing structure  borrowings are continuous and all cash receipts are automatically applied to the outstanding borrowed balance 
as a result of this structure  we anticipate that cash balances will remain at a minimum at all times when there are amounts outstanding under the credit line 
in analyzing our liquidity  we focus on operating working capital  which is comprised of accounts receivable and inventories  net of accounts payable and customer deposits 
our operating working capital at december  was  or of trailing three months of sales annualized 
this is an increase of  from december   when operating working capital was  or of trailing three months of sales annualized 
while we believe that we will continue to have sufficient cash flows to operate our business  meet our financial debt covenants and execute our restructuring plan  there can be no assurances that our operations will generate sufficient cash or that credit facilities will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if assumptions regarding our restructuring efforts  sales and subsequent collections from several of our large customers  as well as revenues generated from new customer orders  are not materially consistent with management expectations  we may encounter cash flow and liquidity issues 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us  which could affect our overall operations 
any additional equity financing  if available  may be dilutive to stockholders or result in limitations on our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards  and additional debt financing  if available  will likely require financial covenants or other restrictions 
sources and uses of cash operating cash flows during the year ended december  and  net cash flows used in operating activities totaled  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the decrease in the accounts receivable balance  and the absence of a significant inventory buildup that occurred during the year ended december  partially offsetting this decrease was a reduction in our customer deposits 
investing cash flows during the years ended december  and  net cash used in investing activities totaled  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures and a decrease in the proceeds from equipment sales 

table of contents financing cash flows during the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities totaled  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in financing activities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the absence of proceeds from an equity offering of  which was completed in september additionally  during we made increased debt payments and payments on capital leases when compared to the year ended december  credit facilities alostar credit facility as disclosed above  on august   we entered into the loan agreement with alostar  providing us with the credit facility 
the credit facility is a secured three year asset based revolving credit facility  pursuant to which alostar will advance funds against a borrowing base consisting of approximately of the face value of our eligible receivables and approximately of the book value of our eligible inventory
