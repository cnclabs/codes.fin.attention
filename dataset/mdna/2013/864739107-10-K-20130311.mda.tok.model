table of contents the local economy in continued to reflect sluggish growth and low consumer confidence for most of the year due to multiple factors  including  but not limited to  persistently high unemployment both locally and regionally  the effects of the fiscal cliff and the uncertainty surrounding the presidential election  the continued lack of specific directionality regarding home prices on long island and the impact of hurricane sandy on consumers and businesses throughout the new york region 
the long island region has traditionally lagged the rest of the country in its reaction to adverse economic events 
as such  it has been slower to show improvement after economic downturns 
while the company s trade area has fared better than new york city and new york state as a whole  the impact of the local economy on the company s results has been significant 
the recession and resultant job losses have negatively affected housing values  commercial real estate values and consumer spending 
improvement  however  has been evident in the past year 
the unemployment rate on long island has stabilized around and it is hoped that the receipt of federal stimulus money associated with hurricane sandy relief efforts will provide a needed boost to local construction spending 
the biggest headwind facing the long island economy continues to be the housing market 
the median price of homes sold in both nassau and suffolk counties rose in but not in the meaningful and sustained fashion that had been forecast 
the local office market was characterized by declining availability and negative net absorption but vacancy rates still hover around

at december   non performing loans totaled million or of total loans outstanding versus million or of total loans at the comparable date 
management expects the remaining non accrual loans to be positively resolved over time through a combination of strong collateral values  ongoing workout agreements with borrowers  expected payoffs in full and future upgrades to performing status 
early stage delinquencies days past due  often a potential harbinger of future credit problems  were also substantially reduced throughout the year to million or of total loans at year end  compared to million or of total loans at the end of finally  total criticized and classified loans declined to million at december  from million at december  the significant improvement in the company s credit metrics in resulted in a reduction in the allowance for loan losses balance to million or of total loans at year end from million or a year ago  although there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in future periods

table of contents analysis of changes in net interest income the table below presents a summary of changes in interest income  interest expense  and the resulting net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the periods presented  each as compared with the preceding period 
because of numerous  simultaneous changes in volume and rate during the period  it is not possible to allocate precisely the changes between volumes and rates

several key factors are considered before executing any transaction including liquidity the ease with which the security can be pledged or sold 
credit quality the likelihood the security will perform according to its original terms  with timely payments of principal and interest 
yield the rate of return on the investment  balanced against liquidity and credit quality 
the company also considers certain key risk factors in its selection of investment securities 
market risk can be defined as the sensitivity of the portfolio s market value to changes in the level of interest rates 
the market value of fixed rate securities increases when interest rates fall  and decreases when interest rates rise 
the longer the duration of the security the greater sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
income risk is identified as the time period over which fixed payments associated with an investment security can be assured 
the shorter the duration of the security  the greater this risk 
asset liability management seeks to limit the change in net interest income as a result of changing interest rates 
in a rising rate environment  when the maturities or the intervals between the re pricing of investments are longer than those of the liabilities that fund them  net interest income will decline 
this is referred to as a liability sensitive position 
conversely  when investments mature or are repriced sooner than their funding sources  net interest income will increase as interest rates rise 
asset liability management attempts to manage the duration of the loan and investment portfolios  as well as that of all funding to minimize the risk to net interest income while maximizing returns 
security selection is governed by the company s investment policy  and serves to supplement the company s asset liability position 

table of contents the company seeks to create an investment portfolio that is diversified across different classes of assets 
at december   the majority of the company s portfolio consisted of investments in us government agency obligations  municipal securities  mortgage backed securities mbs and cmos 
mbs are backed by a pool of mortgages in which investors share payments based on the percentage of the pool they own 
the cash flows associated with cmos are assigned to specific securities tranches in the order in which they are received 
analysis of cmos requires careful due diligence of the mortgages that serve as the underlying collateral 
the company has never owned mortgage obligations with underlying collateral that could be classified as sub prime 
tranche structure  final maturity  and credit support also provide improved assurance of repayment 
the investment portfolio provides collateral for various liabilities to municipal depositors  as well as enhances the company s liquidity position through cash flows and the ability to pledge these assets to secure various borrowing lines 
the company s investment portfolio declined  on average  by million to million in compared to million in average investment in us government agency securities increased to million in from million in municipal securities decreased  on average  by million to million in  from million in average balances of cmos decreased to million in versus million in mbs increased  on average  to million during from thousand in the company also added corporate bonds with an average balance of million in the company held no corporate bonds in the overall portfolio decline in versus was primarily due to maturities  calls and normal cash flows

the company also assesses whether it intends to sell  or if it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell  a security with an unrealized loss before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met  the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as an impairment through a charge to earnings

the following table presents the contractual maturities of selected loans and the sensitivities of those loans to changes in interest rates at december  in thousands one year or less one through five years over five years total commercial and industrial real estate construction total loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rate variable interest rate non performing loans non performing loans are defined as non accrual loans and loans days past due and still accruing 
generally  recognition of interest income is discontinued when reasonable doubt exists as to whether interest can be collected 
ordinarily  loans no longer accrue interest when days past due 
when a loan stops accruing interest  all interest accrued in the current year  but not collected  is reversed against interest income in the current year 
loans start accruing interest again when they become current as to principal and interest  and when  in the opinion of management  they can be collected in full 
the following table shows non accrual loans  loans days past due and still accruing  and restructured loans less than days past due at december in thousands 
table of contents loans accruing but past due contractually days or more loans not accruing interest restructured loans less than days past due total total non accrual loans and restructured loans past due less than days as of december  amounted to million  down from million in the decrease was predominantly related to the aforementioned loan sales 
interest on loans that are no longer accruing interest would have amounted to approximately thousand for under the contractual terms of those loans 
the company has a formal procedure for internal credit review to more precisely identify risk and exposure in the loan portfolio 
with a new and highly experienced workout team in place and improved underwriting  loan review  and early warning systems implemented over the past year  management expects to see a continued reduction in criticized and classified assets in future periods 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that an institution will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement 
management has determined that all tdrs and all non accrual loans are impaired  however  non accrual loans with an impaired balance of thousand or less will be evaluated under the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc with other groups of smaller or homogeneous loans with similar risk characteristics 
management will use judgment to determine if there are other loans outside of these two categories that fit the definition of impaired 
when a loan is impaired under asc  impairment is measured by one of three permitted methodologies present value of expected future cash flows  including balloon payments  if any  discounted at the loan s contractual interest rate the estimate of future cash flows is based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  documented on the asc worksheet 
the present value of an impaired loan s expected future cash flows will change from one reporting period to the next because of the passage of time coupled with the revised estimates in the amount or timing of the cash flows 
fair value of collateral this method is used when a loan is collateral dependent and the liquidation of collateral will satisfy the loan 
consideration will be given to the current market value discounted for the estimated expenses to sell the property 
these expenses may include costs to sell  such as unpaid property taxes  legal costs and environmental clean up costs 
observable market price of the loan this method is used when there is a specific contract to purchase the property or some other evidence of an observable market value 
while every non performing loan is evaluated individually  not every loan requires a specific reserve 
specific reserves fluctuate based on change in the underlying loans  anticipated sources of repayments  and charge offs 
reserves allocated to impaired loans were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
at december   impaired loans totaling million were deemed to require no specific reserves 
the company evaluates classified and criticized loans that are not impaired by categorizing loans by type of risk and applying reserves based on loan type and corresponding risk 
the company also records reserves on non criticized and non classified loan balances 
this represents a general allowance for homogeneous loan pools where the loans are not individually evaluated for impairment  though rated according to loan product type and risk rating 
this amount is determined by applying historical loss factors to pools of loans within the portfolio having similar risk characteristics 
in addition  qualitative factors are considered for areas of concern that cannot be fully quantified in the allocation based on historical net charge off ratios 
qualitative factors include economic outlook trends in delinquency and problem loans changes in loan volume and nature of terms of loans 
table of contents effects of changes in lending policy experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff concentrations of credit board and loan review oversight changes in value of underlying collateral competition  regulation  and other external factors for performing loans  an estimate of adequacy is made by applying the sum of the historical losses and the effects of the qualitative factors specific to the portfolio to the period end balances 
consideration is also given to the loan type and collateral supporting the loans with particular attention paid to commercial real estate construction loans  due to the inherent risk of this type of loan 
allocated and general reserves are available for any identified loss 
for non accrual loans  cash receipts are applied entirely against principal until the loan has been collected in full  after which time  any additional cash receipts are recognized as interest income 
when  in management judgment  the borrower ability to make required interest and principal payments resumes and collectability is no longer in doubt  the loan is returned to accrual status 
when interest accruals are suspended  accrued interest income is reversed and charged to earnings 
during the years ended december   and  interest income totaling million  million  and million  respectively  was recognized on impaired loans 
restructured loans totaling million and million at december  and  respectively  are considered impaired loans 
the decrease in restructured loans in is the result of the aforementioned loan sales 
included in non performing loans are restructured loans of million at december  that are no longer accruing interest 
subsequent to restructure  there were no advances funded on non performing restructured loans outstanding as of december  as of december  and december   non performing restructured loans totaled million and million  respectively 
the loans that have been restructured have been modified as to interest rate  due dates  or extension of the maturity date 
restructured loans are considered to be non accrual loans  if at the time of restructuring the loan was deemed non accrual 
once a sufficient amount of time has passed  generally six months  if the restructured loan has performed under the modified terms  the loan is returned to accrual status 
in addition to the passage of time  the company also considers the collateral value and the ability of the borrower to continue to make payments in accordance with the modified terms 
during the year ended december   the company acquired one commercial real estate oreo which was recorded at thousand  its fair value less estimated selling costs 
the carrying value of the company s two oreo properties  both commercial real estate  was approximately million at december  as of december   classified loans amounted to of total loans  as compared with at december  the significant reduction in classified loans experienced in resulted principally from the previously noted bulk sales of million in loans coupled with ratings upgrades due to the improved financial condition of many borrowers

the company has de emphasized lending of this type over the past three years 
the company recorded a provision for loan losses for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million or from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company recorded million in net loan charge offs  an increase of million from million for the year ended december  the increase in net charge offs in is primarily the result of the aforementioned loan sales 
net charge offs related to the loan sales during were million  primarily commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses balance of million  or of total loans at december   was adequate based on its review of overall credit quality indicators and ongoing loan monitoring processes 
summary of loan losses and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is determined by continuous analysis of the loan portfolio 
that analysis includes changes in the size and composition of the portfolio  historical loan losses  industry wide losses  current and anticipated economic trends  and details about individual loans 
it also includes estimates of the actual value of collateral and other possible sources of repayment 
there can be no assurance that the allowance is  in fact  adequate 
when a loan  in full or in part  is deemed uncollectible  it is charged against the allowance 
this happens when it is well past due and the borrower has not shown the ability or intent to make the loan current  or the borrower does not have sufficient assets to pay the debt  or the value of the collateral is less than the balance of the loan and is not considered likely to increase soon 
residential real estate  consumer loans  and commercial loans with balances of less than thousand are analyzed as a group and not individually because of the large number of loans  small balances and historically low losses in these categories 
in the future  the provision for loan losses and related allowance for loan losses balance may change as a percentage of total loans 
the percentage of net charge offs to average loans during was  compared to in  and during excluding loan sale related charge offs  this ratio would have been in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans  net of unearned discount  was at december   down from in a summary of transactions in the allowance for loan losses follows dollars in thousands

the company considers the determination of the allowance for loan losses to involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible based on evaluations of collectability 
the company s underwriting standards generally require a loan to value ratio of or less  and when applicable  a debt coverage ratio of at least  at the time a loan is originated 
the company has not been directly affected by the increase in defaults of sub prime mortgages as the company does not originate or hold in portfolio sub prime mortgages 
the allowance for loan loss analysis includes changes in the size and composition of the portfolio  the company s own historical loan losses  current and anticipated economic trends  and details about individual loans 
it also includes estimates of the actual value of collateral  other possible sources of repayment and estimates that are susceptible to significant adjustment due to changes in appraisal values of collateral  national and regional economic conditions  and other factors 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  the company reviews its loan portfolio by separate categories which have similar risk and collateral characteristics  eg commercial loans  commercial real estate  construction loans  residential mortgages  home equity loans  and consumer loans 
management conducts a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio which evaluates any loan designated as having high risk including  but not limited to  loans classified as substandard or doubtful as defined by regulation  loans criticized internally or designated as special mention  delinquencies  expirations  overdrafts  loans to customers having experienced recent operating losses and loans identified by management as impaired 
the analysis is performed to determine the amount of the allowance which would be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses contained in the loan portfolio 
the analytical process is regularly reviewed and adjustments may be made based on the assessments of internal and external influences on credit quality 
during and  the company experienced an increase in classified and criticized loans as a result of the deterioration of the economy and resulting failure of businesses  devaluation of assets  and the effect on customers ability or willingness to service debt 
during  management was able to complete the final steps needed to clean up the company s legacy credit issues and significantly reduce the level of criticized and classified loans in the company s portfolio 
with the completion of the previously noted loan sales and million capital raise  the company was able to complete an aggressive balance sheet clean up in less than one year 
pursuant to the agreement with the occ  management has made substantial progress in developing and implementing a written program for the maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the company has devoted substantial management resources including a formal committee to discuss and review the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly 
the company also implemented certain changes in its internal controls with respect to credit administration and credit risk management  primarily with regard to risk rating as well as with respect to the timing and recognition of charge offs  impaired loans  and classified loans

capital resources the company strives to maintain an efficient level of capital  commensurate with its risk profile  on which a competitive rate of return to stockholders will be realized over both the short and long term 
capital is managed to enhance stockholder value while providing flexibility for management to act opportunistically in a changing marketplace 
in determining an optimal capital level the company also considers the capital levels of its peers and the evaluations of its primary regulators 
management continually evaluates the company s capital position in light of current and future growth objectives and regulatory guidelines 
total stockholders equity amounted to million at december  and million at december   the increase largely attributable to the company s million private placement of common stock during the third quarter of the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements 
for the bank to be considered well capitalized  the following minimum capital ratios must be met total risk based capital  tier risk based capital  and tier leverage capital 
the bank is also subject to individual minimum capital ratios established by the occ requiring the bank to maintain a tier leverage capital ratio of at least of adjusted average assets  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least of risk weighted assets  and a total risk based capital ratio at least equal to of risk weighted assets 

table of contents the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during or under the existing stock repurchase plan 
repurchase of shares will only occur if management believes that the purchase will be at prices that are accretive to earnings per share and is the most efficient use of the company s capital 
the company completed a successful million private placement of its common stock with several institutional investors and certain of the company s directors and officers in september the institutional investors purchased  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
certain of the company s directors and officers purchased  shares of common stock at per share 
a total of  shares of the company s common stock were issued during of this number   were issued pursuant to the dividend reinvestment and optional cash purchase plan which is currently inactive 
no stock options were exercised in stock options for  shares were exercised in the company s tce ratio was at december  compared to at december  the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets is calculated by dividing total common stockholders equity by total assets  after reducing both amounts by intangible assets 
the tce ratio is not required by us gaap or by applicable bank regulatory requirements  but is a metric used by management to evaluate the adequacy of the company s capital levels 
since there is no authoritative requirement to calculate the tce ratio  the tce ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures disclosed or used by other companies in the financial services industry 
tangible common equity and tangible assets are non gaap financial measures and should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for or superior to  financial measures determined in accordance with us gaap or as required by bank regulatory agencies 
set forth below are the reconciliations of tangible common equity to us gaap total common stockholders equity and tangible assets to us gaap total assets at december  in thousands total stockholders equity total assets less intangible assets less intangible assets tangible common equity tangible assets all dividends must conform to applicable statutory requirements 
the company s ability to pay dividends depends on the bank s ability to pay dividends 
under usc  a national bank may not pay a dividend on its common stock if the dividend would exceed net undivided profits then on hand 
further  under usc  a national bank must obtain prior approval from the occ to pay dividends on either common or preferred stock that would exceed the bank s net profits for the current year combined with retained net profits net profits minus dividends paid during that period of the prior two years 
the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions 
generally  dividends declared in a given year by a national bank are limited to its net profit  as defined by regulatory agencies  for that year  combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years  less any required transfer to surplus or to fund for the retirement of any preferred stock of which the bank has none as of december  a national bank also may not pay dividends in an amount greater than its undivided profits  and a national bank may not declare any dividends if such declaration would leave the bank inadequately capitalized 
in addition  under the agreement the bank is required to establish a dividend policy that will permit the declaration of a dividend only when the bank is in compliance with its capital program and with the prior written determination of no supervisory objection by the occ 
therefore  the ability of the bank to declare dividends will depend on its future net income and capital requirements and the prior approval of the occ and frb 
at december   no funds were available for dividends from the bank to the company 
risk based capital and leverage guidelines the frb s risk based capital guidelines call for bank holding companies to require minimum ratios of capital to risk weighted assets  which include certain off balance sheet activities  such as standby letters of credit 
the guidelines define capital as being core  or tier capital  which includes common stockholders equity  a limited amount of perpetual preferred stock  minority interest in unconsolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill  or supplementary or tier capital  which includes subordinated debt  redeemable preferred stock  and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
all bank holding companies must meet a minimum ratio of total qualifying capital to risk weighted assets of  of which at least should be in the form of tier capital 
the company s ratios of core capital and total qualifying capital core capital plus tier capital to risk weighted assets were and  respectively  at december  the bank is also subject to individual minimum capital ratios established by the occ requiring the bank to maintain a tier capital ratio of at least equal to of adjusted average assets  to maintain a tier capital ratio at least equal to of risk weighted assets  and to maintain a total risk based capital ratio at least equal to of risk weighted assets 
at december   the bank met all three capital ratios as its tier leverage capital ratio was of adjusted average assets  tier risk based capital ratio was of risk weighted assets  and the total risk based capital ratio was of risk weighted assets 

table of contents critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates the company s accounting and reporting policies conform to us gaap and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses in management s opinion  one of the most critical accounting policies impacting the company s financial statements is the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred losses  increased by the provision for loan losses and recoveries  and decreased by loan charge offs 
for all classes of loans  when a loan  in full or in part  is deemed uncollectible  it is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
this happens when the loan is past due and the borrower has not shown the ability or intent to make the loan current  or the borrower does not have sufficient assets to pay the debt  or the value of the collateral is less than the balance of the loan and is not considered likely to improve soon 
the allowance for loan losses is determined by a continuous analysis of the loan portfolio 
such analysis includes changes in the size and composition of the portfolio  the company s own historical loan losses  industry wide losses  current and anticipated economic trends  and details about individual loans 
it also includes estimates of the actual value of collateral  other possible sources of repayment and estimates that are susceptible to significant changes due to changes in appraisal values of collateral  national and regional economic conditions and other relevant factors 
all non accrual loans over thousand in the commercial and industrial  commercial real estate and construction loan classes and all tdrs are evaluated individually for impairment 
management will use judgment to determine if there are other loans outside of these two categories that fit the definition of impaired 
all other loans are generally evaluated as homogeneous pools with similar risk characteristics 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management reviews the loan portfolio by separate classes that have similar risk and collateral characteristics  eg  commercial and industrial  commercial real estate  construction  residential mortgages  home equity and consumer loans 
the allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components 
the specific component asc relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired 
specific reserves are established based on an analysis of the most probable sources of repayment and liquidation of collateral 
impaired loans that are collateral dependent are reviewed based on their collateral and the estimated time required to recover the company s investment in the loans  as well as the cost of doing so  and the estimate of the recovery 
non collateral dependent impaired loans are reviewed based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  including balloon payments  if any  using the loan s effective interest rate 
while every non performing loan is evaluated individually  not every loan requires a specific reserve 
specific reserves fluctuate based on changes in the underlying loans  anticipated sources of repayment  and charge offs 
the general component asc covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience for each loan class from a trailing eight quarter period which period is expected to be expanded for future calculations and modifying those percentages  if necessary  after adjusting for current qualitative and environmental factors that reflect changes in the collectability of the loan class not captured by historical loss data 
these factors augment actual loss experience and help estimate the probability of loss within the loan portfolio based on emerging or inherent risk trends 
these qualitative factors are applied as an adjustment to historical loss rates and require judgments that cannot be subjected to exact mathematical calculation 
there are no formulas for translating them into a specific basis point adjustment of the company s historical loss rate for a pool of loans having similar risk characteristics 
these adjustments reflect management s overall estimate of the extent to which current losses on a pool of loans will differ from historical loss experience 
these adjustments are subjective estimates and management reviews them on a quarterly basis 
tdrs are also considered impaired with impairment generally measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate at inception or using the fair value of collateral  less estimated costs to sell  if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates 
deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that a future benefit will be realized 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets net of a recorded valuation allowance is largely dependent upon future taxable income  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to carryback losses to available tax years 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers all relevant positive and negative evidence  including taxable income in carryback years  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
other than temporary impairment otti of investment securities management evaluates securities for otti on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation 
for securities in an unrealized loss position  management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
management also assesses whether it intends to sell  or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell  a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met  the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings 
for debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria  the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows otti related to credit loss  which must be recognized in the statement of operations and otti related to other factors  which is recognized in other comprehensive income loss 
the credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis 
for equity securities  the entire amount of impairment is recognized through earnings 
the company did not record any otti related charges during 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management liquidity the process by which financial institutions manage interest earning assets and funding sources under different interest rate environments is called asset liability management 
the principal objective of the company s asset liability management program is to maximize net interest income within an acceptable range of overall risk 
management must ensure that liquidity  capital  interest rate and market risk are prudently managed 
monitoring and managing this risk is a crucial part of the company s asset liability management process 
the program is governed by policies established by the company s board of directors 
these policies are reviewed and approved at least annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for asset liability management to the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco then develops guidelines and strategies to implement the policies 
the alco includes members of the board of directors as well as executive and senior officers of the bank 
it uses computer simulations to quantify interest rate risk and to project liquidity 
the simulations also help the alco to develop contingent strategies to increase net interest income 
the alco assesses the impact of any change in strategy on the company s ability to make loans and repay deposits 
the company has not used forward contracts or interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk 
liquidity management is defined as both the company s and the bank s ability to meet their financial obligations on a continuous basis without material loss or disruption of normal operations 
these obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  funding new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise 
the company and the bank manage liquidity to ensure that it has funds available  at a reasonable cost  to disburse funds as it becomes necessary  both in the ordinary course of business  and under extraordinary circumstances 
liquidity is measured and monitored regularly  thereby allowing management to better understand and react to emerging balance sheet trends  including temporary mismatches with regard to sources and uses of funds after assessing actual and projected cash flow needs 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale  and securities held to maturity due within one year 
the amounts of these assets are dependent upon the bank s operating  financing  lending  and investing activities during any given period 
other sources of liquidity include principal repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities  lines of credit with other financial institutions including the fhlb  growth in core deposits  and sources of wholesale funding such as brokered certificates of deposit and eligibility for lines at the frb 
scheduled loan amortization  maturing securities  and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  whereas deposit flows and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition  and may vary accordingly 
the bank adjusts its liquidity position to fund seasonal deposit outflows and increased loan demand  and to pursue asset and liability management objectives  by seeking to obtain funding at the most economical cost 
the bank relies primarily on its deposits  obtained through full service branches that serve its market area  as well as local municipal deposits 
during  the bank s total deposits increased by to billion when compared to total core deposits increased to billion 
demand deposits increased  and saving  now and money market deposits increased by during partially offsetting the increases in the aforementioned core deposit categories was a decrease in time deposits to million at december  if additional funding is needed  the bank s asset liability and funds management policy allows for wholesale borrowings of up to of total assets 
at december   the bank had access to both secured and unsecured lines of credit from two correspondent banks in the amounts of million and million respectively  which provides for short term credit for liquidity 
no amounts were outstanding on these lines 
the bank is also a member of the fhlb and may borrow using as collateral unencumbered investment securities and residential and commercial mortgages owned by the bank 
at december   the bank had pledged collateral giving it the capacity to borrow approximately million from fhlb 
no amount was outstanding on this facility on december  included in the wholesale borrow limits above  the bank has the ability to access the brokered deposit market in amounts up to of total assets 
at december   the bank s brokered deposits limit was million of which million was outstanding 
there were no securities sold under agreements to repurchase outstanding on december  interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity is determined by the date when each asset and liability in the company s portfolio can be repriced 
sensitivity increases when interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities cannot be repriced at the same time 
while this analysis presents the volume of assets and liabilities re pricing in each period of time  it does not consider how quickly various assets and liabilities might actually be repriced in response to changes in interest rates 
management reviews its interest rate sensitivity regularly and adjusts its asset liability management strategy accordingly 
because the interest rates of assets and liabilities vary according to their maturity  management may selectively mismatch the re pricing of assets and liabilities to take advantage of temporary or projected differences between short and long term interest rates 

table of contents the accompanying table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  dollars in thousands which  based upon certain assumptions  are expected to reprice or mature in each of the time frames shown 
when monitoring its interest sensitivity gap position  management recognizes that these static measurements do not reflect the results of any projected activity and are best utilized as early indicators of potential interest rate exposures 
rather  management relies on net interest income simulation analysis to manage the company asset liability position on a dynamic repricing basis

frb and fhlb stock is not considered rate sensitive 
based on contractual maturity  instrument repricing dates if applicable and projected prepayments 
savings and now accounts are assumed to decay at a rate of per annum based on a year average life 
money market accounts are included in the month category 
based on contractual maturity 
at december   interest earning assets with maturities or repricing dates of less than one year exceed interest bearing liabilities of similar timing 
this is indicative of the bank being in an asset sensitive position 
this cumulative gap might result in increased net interest income if interest rates increase 
if interest rates decline  net interest income may be reduced 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the potential adverse change to earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from repricing risk  basis risk  yield curve risk and option risk  and is measured using financial modeling techniques including interest rate ramp and shock simulations 
interest rate risk depicts the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates change  interest income and expense also change  thereby changing net interest income nii 
nii is the primary component of the company s earnings 
the alco uses a detailed and dynamic model to quantify the effect of sustained changes in interest rates on nii 
while the alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity two years into the future  it uses other tools to monitor longer term interest rate risk 
these simulations are used to determine whether corrective action may be warranted or required in order to adjust the overall interest rate risk profile of the company 
simulation modeling applies alternative interest rate scenarios to the company s balance sheet to estimate the related impact on nii 
the use of simulation modeling assists management in its continuing efforts to achieve earnings stability in a variety of interest rate environments 
the model results are compared to the company s asset liability and interest rate risk management policy stating that projected nii over the next twelve months will not be reduced by more than given a change in interest rates 
nii was projected one year in the future  assuming no growth in assets or liabilities  under a basis point change in interest rates upward and a basis points change downward 
in prior periods the earnings at risk was measured under a down basis point scenario  however  at december   a down basis point environment was analyzed due to the historically low interest rate environment as of the date of computation 

table of contents the company may be considered asset sensitive when net interest income increases in a rising interest rate environment or decreases in a falling interest rate environment 
similarly  the company may be considered liability sensitive when net interest income increases in a falling interest rate environment or decreases in a rising interest rate environment 
at december   the company s balance sheet was considered asset sensitive as a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would have a slightly negative impact on the percentage change in the company s net interest income  whereas  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have a positive impact on the company s net interest income 
the following table presents the company s nii sensitivity at december estimated nii sensitivity rate change at december  basis point rate ramp basis point rate ramp these estimates should not be interpreted as the company s forecast  and should not be considered as indicative of management s expectations for operating results 
they are hypothetical estimates that are based on many assumptions including the nature and timing of changes in interest rates  the shape of the yield curve variations in interest rates for financial instruments of varying maturity at a given moment in time  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit outflows  pricing on loans and deposits  and the reinvestment of cash flows from assets and liabilities  among other things 
while these assumptions are based on management s best estimate of current economic conditions  the company cannot give any assurance that they will actually predict results  nor can they anticipate how the behavior of customers and competitors may change in the future 
when appropriate  alco may use off balance sheet instruments such as interest rate floors  caps  and swaps to hedge its position with regard to interest rate risk 
the board of directors has approved a hedging policy statement that governs the use of such instruments 
at december   there were no derivative financial instruments outstanding 
market risk market risk is the possibility that a financial instrument will lose value as the result of adverse changes in market prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  or the prices of equity securities 
the company s primary exposure to market risk is from changing interest rates 
the company s operations are subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates to the extent that there is a difference between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  withdrawn  mature  or repriced in any given period of time 
the company recognizes that changes in interest rates affect the underlying value of its assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments because the present value of future cash flows and the cash flows themselves change when interest rates change 
economic value of equity eve is defined as the present value of the bank s assets  less the present value of its liabilities  the net present value of any off balance sheet items 
the company s earnings or the net value of its portfolio will change under different interest rate scenarios 
management uses scenario analysis on a static basis to assess its equity value at risk by modeling the potential adverse changes in eve arising from an immediate hypothetical shock in interest rates 
the following table presents the company s eve sensitivity at december estimated eve sensitivity rate change at december  basis point shock basis point shock when modeling eve at risk  management recognizes the high degree of subjectivity when projecting long term cash flows and reinvestment rates  and therefore uses eve at risk as a relative indicator of interest rate risk 
accordingly  the company does not set definitive policy limits over eve at risk  however  the company has set various policy level triggers at which successively heightened monitoring is required and  if necessary  steps will be taken to lower observed volatility of its eve exposure
