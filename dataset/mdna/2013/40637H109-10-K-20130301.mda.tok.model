overview halozyme is a science driven  biopharmaceutical company committed to making molecules into medicines for patients in need 
our research focuses primarily on human enzymes that alter the extracellular matrix 
the extracellular matrix is a complex matrix of proteins and carbohydrates surrounding the cell that provides structural support in tissues and orchestrates many important biological activities  including cell migration  signaling and survival 
over many years  we have developed unique technology and scientific expertise enabling us to pursue this target rich environment for the development of therapies 
our proprietary enzymes can be used to facilitate the delivery of injected drugs and fluids  thus enhancing the efficacy and the convenience of other drugs or can be used to alter abnormal tissue structures for clinical benefit 
we have chosen to exploit our technology and expertise in a balanced way to modulate both risk and spend by developing our own proprietary products in therapeutic areas with significant unmet medical needs  such as diabetes  oncology and dermatology  and licensing our technology to biopharmaceutical companies to collaboratively develop products which combine our technology with the collaborators proprietary compounds 
the majority of the product candidates in our current pipeline are based on rhuph  a patented human recombinant hyaluronidase enzyme 
rhuph temporarily breaks down hyaluronic acid ha a naturally occurring substance that is a major component of the extracellular matrix in tissues throughout the body such as skin and cartilage 
we believe this temporary degradation creates an opportunistic window for the improved subcutaneous delivery of injectable biologics  such as monoclonal antibodies and other large therapeutic molecules  as well as small molecules and fluids 
the ha reconstitutes its normal density within several days and  therefore  we anticipate that any effect of rhuph on the architecture of the subcutaneous space is temporary 
rhup can thus be applied as a drug delivery platform to increase dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs and fluids that are injected under the skin or in the muscle thereby enhancing efficacy or convenience 
for example  rhuph can be used to convert drugs that must be delivered intravenously into subcutaneous injections or reducing the number of subcutaneous injections needed for effective therapy 
we refer to the application of rhuph to facilitate the delivery of other drugs or fluids as enhanze technology 
rhuph is also the active ingredient in our first commercially approved product  hylenex recombinant 
additionally  we are expanding our scientific work in the extracellular matrix by developing other enzymes and agents that target its unique aspects  giving rise to potentially new molecular entities that can be indicated in endocrinology  oncology and dermatology 
our proprietary pipeline consists of multiple clinical stage products in diabetes  oncology and dermatology 
we currently have collaborations with f 
hoffmann la roche  ltd 
and hoffmann la roche  inc roche  pfizer inc pfizer  baxter healthcare corporation baxter  viropharma incorporated viropharma and intrexon corporation intrexon  with three product candidates which have been submitted for regulatory approval in the us and or europe as well as several others at various stages of development 
our operations to date have involved i building infrastructure for and staffing our operations  ii acquiring  developing and securing proprietary protection for our technology  iii developing our proprietary product pipeline  iv entering into and supporting our collaborations with other companies to advance licensed product candidates  and v selling our own approved commercial product  hylenex recombinant hyaluronidase human injection 
currently  we have received only limited revenue from the sales of hylenex recombinant  in addition to other revenues from our collaborations 
future revenues from the sales and or royalties of our product candidates which have not been approved will depend on the ability of halozyme and our collaborators to develop  manufacture  secure regulatory approvals and commercialize the product candidates 
we have incurred net operating losses each year since inception  with an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  highlights of our activities and events in are as follows in december  we and pfizer entered into a collaboration and license agreement  under which pfizer has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining rhuph with pfizer proprietary biologics directed to up to six targets the pfizer collaboration 
targets may be selected on an exclusive or non exclusive basis 
we recognized million in revenue for the licenses of three specified exclusive therapeutic targets in primary care and specialty care indications and three additional targets which pfizer has the right to elect upon payment of additional fees 
in december  roche filed the line extension application of subcutaneous mabthera rituxumab with rhuph mabthera sc to the european medicines agency ema for the treatment of non hodgkin lymphoma  chronic lymphocytic leukemia and follicular lymphoma 
in addition  roche presented positive data from the first stage of a two stage phase clinical trial for mabthera sc at the annual meeting of the american society of hematology 
in december  we entered in a loan and security agreement for a million secured single draw term loan facility and received net proceeds of million from the loan facility 
in august  we announced that the us food and drug administration fda had issued a complete response letter for baxter hyq biologics license application bla requesting additional preclinical data to support the application 
additionally  the blood products division requested that patients no longer be dosed with rhuph in the baxter and viropharma subcutaneous plasma derivative programs  pending review of preclinical data 
based on the most recent data submitted to fda drug division the group regulating the other investigational rhuph programs  including insulin and pegph  the division has confirmed that no action is required against hylenex recombinant or ongoing clinical programs under the hylenex ind 
in september  we and viropharma announced that the fda provided guidance enabling viropharma to resume clinical studies of the subcutaneous administration of cinryze in combination with rhuph the european patent office has announced that a hearing scheduled in opposition of the european patent for our recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme rhuph has been resolved in our favor and that european patent  ep  has been maintained as amended european patent bulletin with claims that are no less broad than claims previously issued in a counterpart united states patent us patent no 

in march  roche submitted a line extension application for subcutaneous herceptin trastuzumab herceptin sc with the ema 
in addition  roche presented phase registration data from the hannah trial at the early breast cancer conference in vienna 
the study met its co primary endpoints of pharmacokinetics and efficacy 
herceptin sc  using rhuph  may provide greater convenience to patients versus the traditional iv method due to its less invasive administration route and quicker administration time minutes versus minutes 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and product sales  net product sales were million in compared to million in and  in product sales in included the recognition of approximately  of deferred revenue related to api for hylenex recombinant previously delivered to baxter  because the earnings process related to these product sales was completed in excluding the recognition of the  of deferred revenue  our product sales in would have been  product sales increased in compared to and primarily due to the increased product sales of hylenex recombinant resulting from the reintroduction of hylenex recombinant in december based on our reintroduction of hylenex recombinant in december  we expect product sales to increase in the future 
revenues under collaborative agreements revenues under collaborative agreements for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands change change upfront payments  license maintenance fees and amortization of deferred upfront  license fees and product based payments pfizer n a n a roche viropharma n a intrexon n a baxter other n a milestone payments roche n a baxter n a n a viropharma n a n a n a reimbursements for research and development services and supply of bulk rhuph roche baxter viropharma n a other total revenues under collaborative agreements in  we recognized million of revenue in connection with the pfizer collaboration 
in  we recognized million of revenue in connection with the viropharma and intrexon collaborations 
in addition  in we recognized revenue of approximately million related to the deferred prepaid product based payments and approximately million related to the deferred upfront payment under the baxter hylenex collaboration resulting from the termination of such collaboration in revenue from reimbursements for research and development services and supply of bulk rhuph increased in compared to due to the increase in services requested by the collaborators  particularly manufacturing services 
revenue from reimbursements for research and development services decreased in compared to due to the decrease in services requested by the collaborators 
research and development services rendered by us on behalf of our collaborators are at the request of the collaborators  therefore  the amount of future revenues related to reimbursable research and development services and supply of bulk rhuph is uncertain 
we expect the non reimbursement revenues under our collaborative agreements to continue to fluctuate in future periods based on our collaborators abilities to meet various clinical and regulatory milestones set forth in such agreements and our abilities to obtain new collaborative agreements 
cost of product sales cost of product sales were million in compared to  in and  in cost of product sales increased in compared to primarily due to the increased product sales of hylenex recombinant 
cost of product sales decreased in compared to primarily due to a reserve for inventory obsolescence of  for hylenex recombinant api in in connection with the termination of the baxter hylenex collaboration in january based on the reintroduction of hylenex recombinant in december  we expect cost of product sales to continue to increase in future periods 
research and development research and development expenses incurred for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands programs product candidates pegph hylenex recombinant analog ph hti enhanze collaborations rhuph platform other total research and development expenses includes research  development and manufacturing expenses related to our proprietary rhuph enzyme 
these expenses were not designated to a specific program at the time the expenses were incurred 
research and development expenses increased in compared to primarily due to a million increase in manufacturing activities to support our collaborators potential launches of the collaboration product candidates and to produce validation batches of hylenex recombinant with the second fill finish manufacturer and a million increase in research activities  offset in part by a million decrease in clinical trial activities primarily related to our more physiologic insulin program 
research and development expenses increased in compared to primarily due to a million increase in manufacturing activities and a million increase in clinical trial activities mainly supporting our more physiologic insulin and pegph programs 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in compensation costs mainly due to the reduction in force in october we expect research and development costs to increase in future periods as we continue with our clinical trial programs and continue to develop and manufacture our product candidates 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in compared to million in and million in sg a expenses were higher in compared to primarily due to a million increase in compensation costs  including million increase in stock based compensation  mainly resulting from building the infrastructure of our commercial organization in connection with the reintroduction of hylenex recombinant in december sg a expenses were higher in compared to primarily due to increases of  in marketing expenses   in market research activities and  in professional fees 
in connection with the reintroduction of hylenex recombinant in december  we expect sg a expenses to increase in future periods as we plan to increase sales and marketing activities 
through the second quarter of  our selling expenses  which include sales and marketing costs  primarily consisted of compensation  consulting fees and costs of market research studies related to our product and product candidates 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we expanded our commercial infrastructure  including the hiring of sales and marketing management and sales representatives 
in addition  we began incurring costs related to advertising  marketing and logistics services for hylenex recombinant in connection with the reintroduction of hylenex recombinant in december other income  net other income in consisted of one time grants of approximately  received in under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program administered under section d of the internal revenue code 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
we will continue to have significant cash requirements to support product development activities 
the amount and timing of cash requirements will depend on the success of our clinical development programs  regulatory and market acceptance  and the resources we devote to research and other commercialization activities 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
currently  we anticipate total net cash burn of approximately to million for the year ending december   depending on the progress of various preclinical and clinical programs  the timing of our manufacturing scale up and the achievement of various milestones and royalties under our existing collaborative agreements 
we do not expect our revenues to be sufficient to fund operations until  at the earliest 
we expect to fund our operations going forward with existing cash resources  anticipated revenues from our existing collaborations and cash that we may raise through future transactions 
we may finance future cash needs through any one of the following financing vehicles i the public offering of securities  ii new collaborative agreements  iii expansions or revisions to existing collaborative relationships  iv private financings  and or v other equity or debt financings 
we are currently a well known seasoned issuer and may file automatic shelf registration statements at any time with the sec 
in february  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
with the sec  which allows us  from time to time  to offer and sell equity  debt securities and warrants to purchase any of such securities  either individually or in units 
on february   we sold approximately million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  generating approximately million in net proceeds 
we may  in the future  offer and sell equity  debt securities and warrants to purchase any of such securities  either individually or in units to raise capital to fund the continued development of our product candidates  the commercialization of our products or for other general corporate purposes 
our existing cash and cash equivalents may not be adequate to fund our operations until we become cash flow positive  if ever 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  financing will be obtained on favorable terms 
if we are unable to raise sufficient funds  we may need to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs  delay the launch of our product candidates  if approved  and or restructure our operations 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders could result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations  the issuance of warrants that may ultimately dilute existing stockholders when exercised and covenants that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
cash flows operating activities net cash used in operations was million in compared to million of net cash used in operations in this change was primarily due to the increase in net loss of million adjusted for non cash items including stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization in addition to changes in working capital 
net cash used in operations was million in compared to million of net cash used in this change was primarily due to the decrease in net loss of million adjusted for non cash items including stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization in addition to changes in working capital 
the decrease in net loss after adjustments for non cash items was mainly due to the receipts of million in upfront license fees from the viropharma and intrexon collaborations and milestone payments totaling million received under the collaborative agreements  offset in part by an increase in research and development services and sg a expenses 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in this was primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment during net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in this was primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment during financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in net cash provided by financing activities in consisted of net proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock in february  million from the long term debt and million from option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities during consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in net cash provided by financing activities during primarily consisted of net proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock in september off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
contractual obligations as of december   future minimum payments due under our contractual obligations are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations  total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest operating leases license payments third party manufacturing obligations total does not include milestone or contractual payment obligations contingent upon the achievement of certain milestone or events if the amount and timing of such obligations are unknown or uncertain 
includes minimum lease payments related to leases of our office and research facilities and certain autos under non cancelable operating leases 
we have contracted with third party manufacturers for the supply of bulk rhuph and fill finish of hylenex recombinant 
under these agreements  we are required to purchase certain quantities each year during the terms of the agreements 
the amounts presented represent our estimates of the minimum required payments under these agreements 
excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities 
contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
for obligations with cancellation provisions  the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee 
for the restricted stock units granted  the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees 
the obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is not included in the preceding table  as the amount is contingent upon continued employment 
in addition  the amount of the obligation is unknown  as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changed to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  the following the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities  the number and scope of our research activities  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our ability to establish and maintain product discovery and development collaborations  including scale up manufacturing costs for our collaborators product candidates  the amount of product sales for hylenex recombinant  the costs of obtaining and validating additional manufacturers of hylenex recombinant  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  and the extent to which we acquire or in license new products  technologies or businesses 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from product sales and collaborative agreements 
payments received under collaborative agreements may include nonrefundable fees at the inception of the agreements  license fees  milestone payments for specific achievements designated in the collaborative agreements  reimbursements of research and development services and supply of bulk rhuph  and or royalties on sales of products resulting from collaborative arrangements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance on revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
refer to note for a further discussion of our revenue recognition policies for product sales and revenues under our collaborative agreements and note for a further discussion of our collaborative agreements 
share based payments we use the fair value method to account for share based payments in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share based compensation 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes merton option pricing model black scholes model that uses assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
changes in these assumptions may lead to variability with respect to the amount of expense we recognize in connection with share based payments 
refer to note for a further discussion of share based payments 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include salaries and benefits  research related manufacturing services  clinical trial expenses  contract services  facilities and other overhead expenses and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred when these expenditures relate to our research and development efforts and have no alternative future uses 
refer to note for a further discussion of research and development expenses 
due to the uncertainty in obtaining the fda and other regulatory approvals  our reliance on third parties and competitive pressures  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the additional costs we will incur in the continued development of our proprietary product candidates for commercialization 
however  we expect our research and development expenses to increase as our product candidates advance into later stages of clinical development 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make ongoing determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to existing resource levels  the scientific and clinical progress of each product candidate  and other market and regulatory developments 
we plan on focusing our resources on those proprietary and collaboration product candidates that represent the most valuable economic and strategic opportunities 
product candidate completion dates and costs vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be certain when  or if  our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or whether any net cash inflow from our other product candidates  or development projects  will commence 
inventories inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
refer to note for a further discussion of our inventories 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
refer to note for a further discussion of our significant accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we typically invest all  or substantially all  of our cash in money market funds that invest primarily in government securities 
our investment policy also permits investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper and government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december  and  we did not have any holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments  or any foreign currency denominated transactions  and all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market mutual funds and other investments that we believe to be highly liquid 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december  and  this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date nor our net loss for the years then ended 
due to the short holding period of our investments  we have concluded that we do not have a material financial market risk exposure
