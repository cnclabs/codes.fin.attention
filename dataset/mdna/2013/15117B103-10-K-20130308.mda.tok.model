item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of several immunotherapy technologies for the treatment of cancer and other difficult to treat diseases 
our drug candidates are derived from a broad set of complementary technologies which have the ability to utilize the human immune system and enable the creation of therapeutic agents 
we are using these technologies to develop targeted immunotherapeutics comprised of antibodies  adjuvants and monotherapies and antibody drug conjugates that prevent or treat cancer and other diseases that modify undesirable activity by the body own proteins or cells 
our lead drug candidates include rindopepimut cdx  a targeted immunotherapeutic in a pivotal phase study for the treatment of front line glioblastoma and a phase study for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma and cdx  an antibody drug conjugate which recently completed a randomized phase b study for the treatment of advanced breast cancer 
in addition  we have a number of earlier stage candidates in clinical development  including cdx  a molecule that inhibits a part of the immune system called the complement system  cdx  a therapeutic fully human monoclonal antibody for cancer indications  cdx  an immune cell mobilizing agent and dendritic cell growth factor and cdx  an apc targeting technology program for cancer indications 
our drug candidates address market opportunities for which we believe current therapies are inadequate or non existent 
we are building a fully integrated  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company that develops important therapies for patients with unmet medical needs 
our program assets provide us with the strategic options to either retain full economic rights to our innovative therapies or seek favorable economic terms through advantageous commercial partnerships 
this approach allows us to maximize the overall value of our technology and product portfolio while best ensuring the expeditious development of each individual product 
the following table includes the programs that we currently believe are significant to our business product generic indication field partner status clinical cdx rindopepimut front line glioblastoma phase cdx glembatumumab vedotin metastatic breast cancer and melanoma phase b cdx rindopepimut recurrent glioblastoma phase cdx renal disease pilot cdx lymphoma leukemia and solid tumors phase cdx cancer  autoimmune disease and transplant phase cdx multiple solid tumors phase preclinical cdx ovarian and renal cancer preclinical the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  and the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
it is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of product candidates to each take five years or more  and for total development costs to exceed million for each product 
table of contents candidate 
our estimates that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
we test potential product candidates in numerous preclinical studies for safety  toxicology and immunogenicity 
we may then conduct multiple clinical trials for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates 
an element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad portfolio of product candidates 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
as a result  we believe our future capital requirements and our future financial success are not substantially dependent on any one product candidate 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates  our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates increases 
regulatory approval is required before we can market our product candidates as therapeutic products 
in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval  the regulatory agency must conclude that our clinical data is safe and effective 
historically  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials through phase have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
a number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
in the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of our product candidates  the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than us 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  in whole or in part  and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
our programs may also benefit from subsidies  grants  contracts or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  it is difficult to accurately estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and 
table of contents could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
during the past five years through december   we incurred an aggregate of million in research and development expenses 
the following table indicates the amount incurred for each of our significant research programs and for other identified research and development activities during the years ended december   and the amounts disclosed in the following table reflect direct research and development costs  license fees associated with the underlying technology and an allocation of indirect research and development costs to each program 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  in thousands rindopepimut cdx cdx cdx cdx cdx cdx other programs total r d expense clinical development programs rindopepimut our lead clinical development program  rindopepimut  is a targeted immunotherapeutic that targets the tumor specific molecule  epidermal growth factor receptor variant iii  or egfrviii 
egfrviii is a mutated form of the epidermal growth factor receptor  or egfr  that is only expressed in cancer cells and not in normal tissue and can directly contribute to cancer cell growth 
egfrviii is expressed in approximately of glioblastoma  or gb  tumors  also referred to as glioblastoma multiforme  or gbm  the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer 
rindopepimut is composed of the egfrviii peptide linked to a carrier protein called keyhole limpet hemocyanin  or klh  and administered together with the adjuvant gm csf 
the food and drug administration  or fda  and the european medicines agency  or ema  have both granted orphan drug designation for rindopepimut for the treatment of egfrviii expressing gb 
the fda has also granted fast track designation 
in april  we and pfizer inc entered into a license and development agreement under which pfizer was granted an exclusive worldwide license to rindopepimut 
this agreement provided for reimbursement by pfizer of all costs incurred by us in connection with the collaboration since the effective date 
in november  the agreement was terminated and all rights to rindopepimut were returned to us 
since the termination of this agreement  pfizer is no longer funding the development of rindopepimut 
the phase a study of rindopepimut referred to as activate was led by collaborating investigators at the brain center at duke comprehensive cancer center in durham  north carolina and at md anderson cancer center in houston  texas and enrolled evaluable gb patients 
an extension of the phase a study referred to as act ii evaluated additional gb patients treated in 
table of contents combination with the current standard of care  maintenance temozolomide  or tmz  at the same two institutions 
we initiated act iii  a phase b randomized study of rindopepimut combined with standard of care  tmz  versus standard of care alone in patients with gb in over sites throughout the united states 
in december  we announced an amendment to convert the act iii study to a single arm phase clinical trial in which all patients were to receive rindopepimut in combination with tmz 
the decision  which followed the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee  was based on the observation that the majority of patients randomized to the control standard of care arm withdrew from this open label study after being randomized to the control arm 
patients participating in the control arm of the study were offered the option to receive treatment with rindopepimut 
under this amendment  the act iii study provided for a multi center  non randomized dataset for rindopepimut in patients with newly diagnosed gb 
in november  we announced three year survival data for each of our three phase studies in rindopepimut  act iii  act ii and activate 
the median overall survival  or os  in act iii was months from diagnosis months from study entry and os was at three years 
the median os in act ii was months from diagnosis months from study entry and os was at three years 
the median os in activate was months from diagnosis months from study entry and os was at three years 
in addition we also announced data from a retrospective analysis of egfrviii expression status and associated clinical outcome in the phase radiation therapy oncology group  or rtog  study 
this analysis was conducted by the university of texas md anderson cancer center in cooperation with rtog to provide an assessment of the prognosis for patients with egfrviii positive disease contemporary with the act iii data 
across three phase studies of rindopepimut  survival data remains consistent and suggests a continuing survival benefit in comparison to independent control datasets see chart below at the median and at three years

table of contents in order to provide comparable timeframes across datasets  data have been estimated assuming study entry at three months from diagnosis 
in december  we initiated act iv  a pivotal  randomized  double blind  controlled phase study of rindopepimut in patients with surgically resected  egfrviii positive gb 
patients are randomized after the completion of surgery and standard chemoradiation treatment 
the treatment regime includes a rindopepimut priming phase post radiation followed by an adjuvant tmz phase and a rindopepimut maintenance therapy phase 
patients are treated until disease progression or intolerance to therapy 
the primary objective of the study is to determine whether rindopepimut plus adjuvant gm csf improves the overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed egfrviii positive gb after gross total resection  or gtr  when compared to treatment with tmz and a control injection of klh 
klh is a component of rindopepimut and was selected due to its ability to generate a similar injection site reaction to that observed with rindopepimut 
act iv will enroll up to patients at over centers worldwide to recruit approximately patients with gtr to be included in the primary analysis 
we expect to complete patient accrual by the end of and anticipate receiving data to months after completing accrual 
we anticipate act iv to cost over million during its duration 
in december  we also initiated react  a phase study of rindopepimut in combination with avastin in patients with recurrent egfrviii positive gb 
react will enroll approximately patients in a first or second relapse of gb following receipt of standard therapy and will be conducted at approximately sites across the united states 
approximately patients who have yet to receive avastin will be randomized to receive either rindopepimut and avastin or a control injection of klh and avastin in a blinded fashion 
another patients who are refractory to avastin having received avastin in either the frontline or recurrent setting with subsequent progression will receive rindopepimut plus avastin in a single treatment arm 
we expect data from this study to be available in the second half of in addition  researchers at stanford university are conducting an investigator sponsored  pilot trial of rindopepimut in pediatric patients with pontine glioma 
patient enrollment is ongoing for this trial 
glembatumumab vedotin cdx cdx is an antibody drug conjugate  or adc  that consists of a fully human monoclonal antibody  cr  linked to a potent cell killing drug  monomethyl auristatin e  or mmae 
the cr antibody specifically targets glycoprotein nmb  referred to as gpnmb  that is expressed in a variety of human cancers including breast cancer and melanoma 
the adc technology  comprised of mmae and a stable linker system for attaching it to cr  was licensed from seattle genetics  inc the adc is designed to be stable in the bloodstream 
following intravenous administration  cdx targets and binds to gpnmb and upon internalization into the targeted cell  cdx is designed to release mmae from cr to produce a cell killing effect 
the fda has granted fast track designation to cdx for the treatment of advanced  refractory resistant gpnmb expressing breast cancer 
treatment of breast cancer in june  an open label  multi center phase study was initiated of cdx administered intravenously once every three weeks to patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had received prior therapy median of seven prior regimens 
the study began with a bridging phase to confirm the maximum tolerated dose  or mtd  and then expanded into a phase open label  multi center study 
the study confirmed the safety of cdx at the pre defined maximum dose level mg kg in patients 
an additional patients were enrolled in an expanded phase cohort for a total of treated patients at mg kg  the phase dose to evaluate the pfs rate at weeks 
as previously seen in melanoma patients  the mg kg dose was well tolerated in this patient population with the most common adverse events of rash  alopecia  and fatigue 
the primary activity endpoint  which called 
table of contents for at least of patients in the phase study portion to be progression free at weeks  was met as of evaluable patients were progression free at weeks 
for all patients treated at the maximum dose level  tumor shrinkage was seen in and median pfs was weeks 
a subset of patients had triple negative disease  a more aggressive breast cancer subtype that carries a high risk of relapse and reduced survival as well as limited therapeutic options due to lack of over expression of her neu  estrogen and progesterone receptors 
in these patients  had some tumor shrinkage  week pfs rate was  and median pfs was weeks 
tumor samples from a subset of patients across all dose groups were analyzed for gpnmb expression 
the tumor samples from most patients showed evidence of stromal and or tumor cell expression of gpnmb 
in december  we completed enrollment of emerge  a randomized  multi center phase b study of cdx in patients with heavily pre treated  advanced  gpnmb positive breast cancer 
patients were randomized to receive either cdx or single agent investigator choice  or ic  chemotherapy 
patients randomized to receive ic were allowed to cross over to receive cdx following disease progression 
activity endpoints include response rate  pfs and os 
in december  we announced final results  as shown below  from the emerge study which suggested that cdx induces significant response rates compared to currently available therapies in patient subsets with advanced  refractory breast cancers with gpnmb over expression expression in greater than of tumor cells and in patients with triple negative breast cancer 
the overall survival  or os  and progression free survival  or pfs  of patients treated with cdx was also observed to be greatest in patients with triple negative breast cancer who also over express gpnmb and all patients with gpnmb over expression

patients who initially received investigator choice ic and subsequently crossed over to receive cdx n are included in the pfs analysis for each treatment 
these patients  with a median os of months  are assigned to the ic arm only for os analysis 
median os for the remaining ic patients who did not cross over is months 
when cross over patients are removed  median os in patients with gpnmb over expression is months for cdx vs months for ic p and median os in triple negative patients with gpnmb over expression is months for cdx vs months for ic p 
in december  we had our end of phase b meeting with the fda for our cdx program 
based on this meeting  we intend to initiate a randomized study of cdx suitable for accelerated approval in patients with triple negative breast cancer that also over express gpnmb in the second half of one lot of our cdx product candidate was aseptically filled in by formatech  a third party contract manufacturer 
at the end of january  we were notified by the fda that because significant good manufacturing practice  or cgmp  violations were uncovered during inspection of formatech  our phase b study for cdx was being placed on partial clinical hold 
the clinical hold did not significantly impact the conduct or analysis of the phase b study for purposes of determining next steps in our future development of cdx in march  we received written confirmation from the fda that the clinical hold was removed following their review of our clinical hold response regarding reprocessing of the cdx manufactured at formatech 
treatment of metastatic melanoma in  we completed enrollment of patients in a phase open label  multi center  dose escalation study to evaluate the safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics of cdx for patients with un resectable stage iii or stage iv melanoma who had failed no more than one prior line of cytotoxic therapy 
the mtd was determined to be mg kg administered intravenously once every three weeks 
the study achieved its primary activity objective with an orr in the phase cohort of 
median pfs was months 
cdx was generally well tolerated  with the most frequent treatment related adverse events being rash  fatigue  hair loss  pruritus  diarrhea and neuropathy 
in the subset of patients with tumor biopsies  high levels of tumor expression of gpnmb appeared to correlate with favorable outcome 
in the seven patients whose tumors were found to express high amounts of gpnmb  and who were treated at the maximum tolerated doses across all dosing schedules  median pfs was months 
the development of rash  which may be associated with the presence of gpnmb in the skin also seemed to correlate with greater pfs 
we intend to initially focus our resources on advancing cdx for the treatment of breast cancer while pursuing further development of cdx in melanoma and other indications that are known to express gpnmb 

table of contents cdx cdx is a molecule that inhibits a part of the human immune system called the complement system 
the complement system is a series of proteins that are important initiators of the body acute inflammatory response against disease  infection and injury 
excessive complement activation also plays a role in some persistent inflammatory conditions 
cdx is a soluble form of naturally occurring complement receptor that has been shown to inhibit the activation of the complement cascade in animal models and in human clinical trials 
in preclinical studies  cdx has been shown to inhibit both the classical and alternative pathways of complement activation 
dense deposit disease  or ddd  is a rare and devastating disease that is caused by uncontrolled activation of the alternative pathway of complement and leads to progressive kidney damage in children 
there is currently no treatment for patients with ddd and about half progress to end stage renal disease within years 
because ddd recurs in virtually all patients who receive a kidney transplant  transplantation is not a viable option for these patients 
in animal models of ddd  cdx treatment showed evidence of reversal of kidney damage 
initial experience under an investigator sponsored ind indicated that cdx limits complement abnormalities in ddd 
in  we completed process development activities and in and we manufactured multiple runs of cgmp clinical drug product at our fall river manufacturing facility in preparation for our phase pilot study 
we are planning to initiate a pilot study of cdx in a small number of ddd patients to determine the appropriate dose and regimen for further clinical development based on safety  tolerability and biological activity with data expected by the end of cdx cdx is a human monoclonal antibody that targets cd  a potentially important target for immunotherapy of various cancers 
we have entered into license agreements with the university of southampton  uk for intellectual property related to uses of anti cd antibodies and with medarex now a subsidiary of the bristol myers squibb company for access to the ultimab technology to develop and commercialize human antibodies to cd cd acts downstream from cd and may provide a novel way to regulate the immune responses 
cd is a co stimulatory molecule on t cells and is over expressed in certain lymphomas and leukemias 
cdx is an agonist antibody designed to have two potential therapeutic mechanisms 
cdx has been shown to activate immune cells that can target and eliminate cancerous cells in tumor bearing mice and to directly kill or inhibit the growth of cd expressing lymphomas and leukemias in vitro and in vivo 
both mechanisms have been seen even at low doses in appropriate preclinical models 
in november  we initiated an open label  dose escalating phase study of cdx in patients with selected malignant solid tumors or hematologic cancers at multiple clinical sites in the united states 
the phase study is designed to test five escalating doses of cdx to determine a phase dose for further development based on safety  tolerability  potential activity and immunogenicity 
the study will accrue approximately patients in each of the two arms  either selected refractory or relapsed solid tumors or lymphomas or leukemias known to express cd patients will have received all appropriate prior therapies for their specific disease 
the trial design incorporates both single dosing and multiple dosing regimens at each dose level 
enrollment has completed in the phase portion of the solid tumor arm and cdx was determined to be well tolerated to date  including at the highest dose level 
following a review of the clinical data from these patients  an expansion cohort will be enrolled in we continue to enroll patients in the dose escalation portion of the lymphoma and leukemia arm and also plan the initiation of an expansion cohort of this arm in we anticipate reporting data from the cdx program in the second half of 
table of contents cdx cdx is a fms like tyrosine kinase ligand  or fltl  stem cell mobilizer and dendritic cell growth factor 
we licensed cdx from amgen in march cdx is a potent hematopoietic cytokine that stimulates the expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells 
cdx has demonstrated a unique capacity to increase the number of circulating dendritic cells in both laboratory and clinical studies 
in addition  cdx has shown impressive results in models of cancer  infectious diseases and inflammatory autoimmune diseases 
we believe cdx may hold significant opportunity for synergistic development in combination with other proprietary molecules in our portfolio 
in february  we announced final results from our dose escalating phase study of cdx in healthy subjects in collaboration with rockefeller university 
the phase study evaluated seven different dosing regimens of cdx to determine the appropriate dose for further development based on safety  tolerability  and biological activity 
the data from the study were consistent with previous clinical experience and demonstrated that cdx was well tolerated and can effectively mobilize hematopoietic stem cell populations in healthy volunteers 
based on the safety profile and the increases observed for cd stem cells and dendritic cells  we plan to initiate a pilot study in hematopoietic stem cell transplant by the end of cdx cdx  developed from our apc targeting technology  is a fusion protein consisting of a fully human monoclonal antibody with specificity for the dendritic cell receptor  dec  linked to the ny eso tumor antigen 
in humans  ny eso has been detected in of all melanoma  lung  esophageal  liver  gastric  prostate  ovarian and bladder cancers  thus representing a broad opportunity 
this product is intended to selectively deliver the ny eso antigen to dendritic cells for generating robust immune responses against cancer cells expressing ny eso we are developing cdx for the treatment of malignant melanoma and a variety of solid tumors which express the proprietary cancer antigen ny eso  which we licensed from the ludwig institute for cancer research in preclinical studies have shown that cdx is effective for activation of human t cell responses against ny eso in october  we announced results from a dose escalating  multi center  phase study that evaluated three different doses of cdx in combination with toll like receptor agonists poly iclc or hiltonol and or r or resiquimod 
in total  the study enrolled patients with advanced malignancies that had progressed after any available curative and or salvage therapies 
of patients had confirmed ny eso expression in archived tumor sample 
thirteen patients maintained stable disease for up to months with a median of months 
treatment was well tolerated and there were no dose limiting toxicities 
humoral responses were elicited in both ny eso positive and negative patients 
ny eso specific t cell responses were absent or low at baseline  but increased post vaccination in of evaluable patients  including both cd and or cd t cell responses 
robust immune responses were observed with cdx with resiquimod and poly iclc alone and in combination 
the study has identified a well tolerated and immunogenic regimen to take forward into the future studies and we expect that a study sponsored by the cancer immunotherapy trials network of the national cancer institute will be initiated in preclinical programs cdx cdx is a fully human monoclonal adc that targets tim  a molecule that is highly expressed on renal and ovarian cancers with minimal expression in normal tissues 
the antibody  cdx  is linked to mmae using seattle genetics proprietary technology 
the adc is designed to 
table of contents be stable in the bloodstream  but to release mmae upon internalization into tim expressing tumor cells  resulting in a targeted cell killing effect 
cdx has shown potent activity in preclinical models of ovarian and renal cancer 
we are conducting proof of concept studies in to optimize the drug candidate to move into future manufacturing and ind enabling studies 
marketed products rotavirus vaccine rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea and vomiting in infants and children 
in  we licensed our oral rotavirus strain to glaxo and glaxo assumed responsibility for all subsequent clinical trials and all other development activities 
we licensed in the rotavirus strain that was used to develop glaxo rotarix rotavirus vaccine in and owe a license fee of to cincinnati children hospital medical center  or cch  on net royalties received from glaxo 
in may  we entered into an agreement whereby an affiliate of paul royalty fund ii  lp  or prf  purchased a interest in the net royalties we received on worldwide sales of rotarix 
in december  a us patent for our rotavirus strain that we licensed to glaxo expired 
the glaxo agreement terminates automatically upon the expiration  lapse or invalidation of the last relevant patent right patent or patent application covered by the glaxo agreement 
the only remaining relevant patent right is a patent application in mexico with a projected final expiry date in may which is under appeal 
the prf agreement provided for a normal expiry of the prf agreement on december  except that the prf agreement provides for an exclusive day right of negotiation for extension in certain circumstances 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include accounting for business combinations  revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  research and development expenses and stock based compensation expense 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could materially change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements business combinations we account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting 
we record the fair value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we assess the fair value of assets  including intangible assets such as ipr d  using a variety of methods including present value models 
each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
the method used to estimate the fair values of ipr d assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset  including a market participant assumptions regarding the probability of completing ipr d projects  which would require obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of the 
table of contents associated drug candidate  a market participant estimates regarding the timing of and the expected costs to complete ipr d projects  a market participant estimates of future cash flows from potential product sales  and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant 
transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with the transaction are expensed as incurred 
ipr d assets acquired in a business combination initially are recorded at fair value and accounted for as indefinite lived intangible assets 
these assets are maintained on our consolidated balance sheets until either the project underlying them is completed or the assets become impaired 
if a project is completed  the carrying value of the related intangible asset is amortized over the remaining estimated life of the asset beginning in the period in which the project is completed 
if a project becomes impaired or is abandoned  the carrying value of the related intangible asset is written down to its fair value and an impairment charge is taken in the period in which the impairment occurs 
ipr d assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis during the third quarter  or earlier if impairment indicators are present 
we performed an annual impairment test of the ipr d assets as of july  and concluded that the ipr d assets were not impaired 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination with a finite life are recorded at fair value and amortized over the greater of economic consumption or on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination is recorded to goodwill 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the third quarter  or earlier if impairment indicators are present 
we performed an annual impairment test of the goodwill asset as of july  and concluded that the goodwill asset was not impaired 
revenue recognition we recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we have entered into and in the future may enter into biopharmaceutical product development agreements with collaborative partners for the research and development of therapeutic drug products 
the terms of the agreements may include nonrefundable signing and licensing fees  funding for research  development and manufacturing  milestone payments and royalties on any product sales derived from collaborations 
these multiple element arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
in accounting for these transactions  we allocate revenue to the various elements based on their fair value 
the fair value of a revenue generating element can be based on current selling prices offered by us or another party for current products or our best estimate of a selling price for future products 
revenue allocated to an individual element is recognized when all other revenue recognition criteria are met for that element 
these collaborative and other agreements may contain milestone payments 
revenues from milestones  if they are considered substantive  are recognized upon successful accomplishment of the milestones 
determining whether a milestone is substantive involves judgment  including an assessment of our involvement in achieving the milestones and whether the amount of the payment is commensurate to our performance 
if not considered substantive  milestones are initially deferred and recognized over the remaining performance obligation 
payments received to fund certain research activities are recognized as revenue in the period in which the research activities are performed 
revenue from contracts and grants is recognized as the services are performed and recorded as effort is expended on the contracted work and billed to the 
table of contents government or our contractual partner 
payments received in advance that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue when the research projects are performed 
product royalty revenue consists of payments received from licensees for a portion of sales proceeds from products that utilize our licensed technologies and are recognized when the amount of and basis for such royalty payments are reported to us in accurate and appropriate form and in accordance with the related license agreement 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  and intangible assets when circumstances indicate that an event of impairment may have occurred 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
research and development expenses research and development costs  including internal and contract research costs  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist mainly of clinical trial costs  manufacturing of clinical material  toxicology and other studies  personnel costs  depreciation  license fees and funding of outside research 
clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with clinical research organizations cro 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  and project management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cros to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
stock based compensation expense we record stock based compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors based on the estimated fair values of the stock based awards expected to vest at the grant date and is adjusted  if necessary  to reflect actual forfeitures 
compensation expense for all stock based awards to employees and directors is recognized using the straight line method over the term of vesting or performance 
we record stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to non employees based on the fair value of the stock options which is re measured over the vesting term resulting in periodic adjustments to stock based compensation expense

liquidity and capital resources our cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and consist primarily of investments in money market mutual funds with commercial banks and financial institutions 
we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances 
we invest our excess cash balances in marketable securities including municipal bond securities  us government agency securities  and high grade corporate bonds that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity 
the use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our offices  laboratories and manufacturing facility  fees paid in connection with preclinical studies  clinical studies  contract manufacturing  laboratory supplies and services  consulting  legal and other professional fees 
to date  the primary sources of cash flows from operations have been payments received from our collaborative partners and from government entities 
the timing of any new collaboration agreements  government contracts or grants and any payments under these agreements  contracts or grants cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
our working capital at december  was million 
at december   our term loan balance was million 
we incurred a loss of million for the year ended december  net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million 
in january  we issued  shares of common stock under the cantor amendment and raised million in net proceeds 
in february  we issued  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering and raised million  after deducting underwriting fees and estimated offering expenses 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  and the million raised during the two months ended february  are sufficient to meet estimated working capital requirements and fund planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
during the next twelve months  we may take further steps to raise additional capital to fund our long term liquidity needs 
our capital raising activities may include  but may not be limited to  one or 
table of contents more of the following the licensing of technology programs with existing or new collaborative partners  possible business combinations  issuance of debt  or the issuance of common stock or other securities via private placements or public offerings 
while we may continue to seek capital through a number of means  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and our negotiating position in capital raising efforts may worsen as existing resources are used 
there is also no assurance that we will be able to enter into further collaborative relationships 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to our stockholders  debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate as a business  and licensing or strategic collaborations may result in royalties or other terms which reduce our economic potential from products under development 
if we are unable to raise the funds necessary to meet our long term liquidity needs  we may have to delay or discontinue the development of one or more programs  discontinue or delay on going or anticipated clinical trials  license out programs earlier than expected  raise funds at significant discount or on other unfavorable terms  if at all  or sell all or part of our business 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net loss of million

we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in the area of research and development  including preclinical and clinical trials  as our drug candidates are developed

as our drug candidates progress through the clinical trial process  we may be obligated to make significant milestone payments 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to net purchases of marketable securities for the year ended december  of million as compared to million for the year ended december  we expect that cash used in investing activities will increase over the next twelve months as we purchase more marketable securities with the funds raised during the two months ended february  financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net proceeds from stock issuances were million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we paid million in principal payments on our term loan during the year ended december  in february  we paid million to satisfy all outstanding principal related to the convertible subordinated debt assumed in connection with the curagen acquisition

at december   we believe we are in compliance with the loan agreement 
aggregate contractual obligations we have entered into license agreements whereby we have received licenses or options to license technology  specified patents and or patent applications 
these license and collaboration agreements generally provide for royalty payments equal to specified percentages of product sales  annual license maintenance fees  continuing patent prosecution costs and potential future milestone payments to third parties upon the achievement of certain development  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of december   such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk as part of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is used to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we invest our cash primarily in money market mutual funds

our investment policy seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal and maintaining adequate liquidity

we do not utilize derivative financial instruments 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivables and accounts payable approximates fair value at december  due to the short term maturities of these instruments
