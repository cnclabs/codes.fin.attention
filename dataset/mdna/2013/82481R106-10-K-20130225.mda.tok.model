overview shire plc is a leading specialty biopharmaceutical company that focuses on meeting the needs of the specialist physician 
the company has grown through acquisition  completing a series of major transactions that have brought therapeutic  geographic and pipeline growth and diversification 
the company will continue to evaluate companies  products and pipeline opportunities that offer a good strategic fit and have the potential to deliver demonstrable value to all of the company s stakeholders patients  physicians  policy makers  payors  investors and employees 
shire s vision is to imagine and lead the future of healthcare for people with life altering conditions  creating value for society 
the company will execute on its vision through its strategy and business model 
for further details of shire s strategy refer to part i item business of this annual report on form k 
shire focuses on treatments and services for symptomatic conditions in areas of high medical need  so patients experience a noticeable and ongoing improvement in their lives 
through deep understanding of patients needs  the company develops and provides healthcare in the areas of behavioral health and gastro intestinal conditions  rare genetic diseases  and regenerative medicine  as well as other symptomatic conditions treated by specialist physicians 
shire s in licensing and acquisition efforts are focused on products in specialist markets with strong intellectual property protection or other forms of market exclusivity and global rights 
shire believes that a carefully selected and balanced portfolio of products with strategically aligned and relatively small scale sales forces will deliver strong results 
substantially all of the company s revenues  expenditures and net assets are attributable to the r d  manufacture  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products within three reportable segments sp  hgt and rm 
the company also earns royalties where shire has out licensed products to third parties which are recorded as revenues 
revenues are derived primarily from two sources sales of the company s own products and royalties of total revenues are derived from product sales  of which are within sp  are within hgt and are within rm  and of total revenues are derived from royalties 
the markets in which the company conducts its business are highly competitive and highly regulated 
there is increasing legislation both in the us and the rest of the world which is placing downward pressure on the net pricing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices 
for example the us government passed healthcare reform legislation in which included an increase in medicaid rebate rates and extended medicaid rebates to those products provided through medicaid managed care organizations 
the legislation also imposed excise fees to be paid by both pharmaceutical manufacturers from and medical device companies from 
the impact of these recent changes to us healthcare legislation  and other healthcare reforms in the rest of the world  has not to date had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the health care industry is also experiencing pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep prices low while increasing access to drugs  increasing challenges from third party payors for products to have demonstrable clinical benefit  with pricing and reimbursement approval becoming increasingly linked to a product s clinical effectiveness and impact on overall costs of patient care  increased r d costs  because development programs are typically larger and take longer to get approval from regulators  challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers  governments and healthcare systems favoring earlier entry of low cost generic drugs  and higher marketing costs  due to increased competition for market share 
shire s strategy has been developed to address these industry wide competitive pressures 
this strategy has resulted in a series of initiatives in the following areas markets historically  shire s portfolio of approved products has been heavily weighted towards the north american market 
the acquisition in of tkt and the consequent establishment of the company s hgt business  together with the acquisitions of new river pharmaceuticals in which brought full rights to adhd product vyvanse  jerini ag jerini in which brought the hae product firazyr  equasym in which facilitated shire s immediate access to the european adhd market and movetis nv movetis in which brought eu rights to resolor 
the acquisition of abh in which subsequently became rm  and ferrokin biosciences in which brought a new hematology drug to the sp portfolio provided shire with platforms to increase its presence in europe and the rest of the world row  thereby working towards diversifying the risk associated with reliance on one geographic market 
in the sp and hgt businesses derived and  respectively  of their product sales from outside of the us 
currently all rm product sales are generated in the us 
shire has ongoing commercialization and late stage development activities  which are expected to further supplement the diversification of revenues in the future  including the following continued launch of vyvanse in brazil marketed as venvanse and the potential approval and launch of vyvanse in mexico  approval of elvanse tyvense in certain countries in the eu for treatment of adhd in children  filing in of an application to expand the label of firazyr in the eu to include the treatment of attacks of ace inhibitor induced angioedema  filing in of an application in europe for the vpriv label to be updated with data regarding the impact of vpriv on certain parameters of bone disease in type gaucher patients  intuniv phase clinical program to support submission of an maa in the eu  and continued roll out of dfu in canada and resolor in the eu 
r d over the last five years shire has focused its r d efforts on products in its core therapeutic areas and concentrated its resources on obtaining regulatory approval for later stage pipeline products within these core therapeutic areas 
in addition to continued efforts in its late stage pipeline for the adhd  gi  hgt and rm therapeutic areas  shire has also progressed work on an earlier stage pipeline 
evidence of the successful progression of the late stage pipeline can be seen in the granting of approval and associated launches of the company s products over the last five years 
in this time several products have received regulatory approval including in the us  intuniv in  vpriv in  and firazyr in  in the eu  vpriv in and elvanse tyvense in  in canada  vyvanse in and dermagraft in shire s strategy is focused on the development of product candidates that have a lower risk profile 
as shire further expanded its earlier phase pipeline  r d costs in included expenditure on several pre clinical to phase studies for products in development as well as phase b and phase studies to support recently launched products in the sp and hgt businesses  together with the development of new projects in the sp  hgt and rm businesses 
for a discussion of the company s current development projects see item business 
patents and market exclusivity the loss or expiration of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity with respect to any of the company s major products could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations  as generic products may enter the market 
companies selling generic products often do not need to complete extensive clinical studies when they seek registration of a generic or biosimilar product and accordingly  they are generally able to sell the company s products at a much lower price 
as expected  in teva and impax commenced commercial shipments of their authorized generic versions of adderall xr  which led to lower sales of branded adderall xr compared to the period prior to the authorized generic launch 
as discussed in item business  in june the fda reached a decision on the citizen petition for adderall xr which was filed in october the fda also approved an anda for a generic version of adderall xr 
sales of axr decreased in due to the launch of a new generic product 
in authorized generic and generic versions of the company s carbatrol and reminyl products respectively were launched  which led to lower sales of these branded products compared to the period before loss of exclusivity 
shire is engaged in various legal proceedings with generic manufacturers with respect to its vyvanse  intuniv  fosrenol  lialda and adderall xr patents

the contractual obligations table above does not include certain milestones and other contractual commitments where payment is contingent upon the occurrence of events which are yet to occur and therefore payment is not yet due 
at december  the most significant of the company s milestone and contractual commitments which are contingent on the occurrence of future events are as follows i collaboration with acceleron for actriib class of molecules on september  shire announced that it had expanded its hgt pipeline by acquiring an exclusive license in markets outside of north america for the actriib class of molecules being developed by acceleron 
the collaboration will initially focus on further developing hgt also called ace  the lead actriib drug candidate  which is in development for the treatment of patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd 
the phase a trial is on hold and clinical safety is under review 
hgt and the other actriib class of molecules have the potential to be used in other muscular and neuromuscular disorders with high unmet medical need

shire and acceleron will conduct the collaboration through a joint steering committee  with subcommittees including a joint manufacture committee  and a joint patent committee to monitor the development of hgt and other compounds 
ii research collaboration with santaris pharma a s santaris on locked nucleic acid lna drug platform on august  shire announced that it had entered into a research collaboration with santaris  to develop its proprietary lna technology in a range of rare diseases

iii collaboration and license agreement with sangamo to develop therapeutics for hemophilia on february  shire and sangamo announced that they had entered into a collaboration and license agreement to develop therapeutics for hemophilia and other monogenic diseases based on sangamo s zfp technology 
sangamo is responsible for all activities through submission of investigational new drug applications and european clinical trial applications for each product and shire will reimburse sangamo for its internal and external research program related costs 
shire is responsible for clinical development and commercialization of products arising from the collaboration 
in the year to december  shire made an upfront payment to sangamo of million  for technology access and r d funding  which was expensed to r d 
in the year to december  shire s share of r d costs under this collaboration agreement was million nil  nil which were expensed to r d 
shire may be required to pay research  regulatory  development and commercial milestone payments up to a maximum of million and to pay royalties on net sales of the product 
iv acquisition of ferrokin on april  shire completed the acquisition of of the outstanding share capital of ferrokin 
the acquisition date fair value of consideration totaled million  comprising cash consideration paid on closing of million and the fair value of contingent consideration payable of million 
the maximum amount of contingent cash consideration which may be payable by shire in future periods is million 
the amount of contingent cash consideration ultimately payable by shire is dependent upon the achievement of certain clinical development  regulatory and net sales milestones 
for further details refer to part iv item exhibits and financial statement schedules  note of this annual report on form k

off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements  aside from the collaborations containing contractual commitments and milestones which are contingent on future events as outlined above  that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
foreign currency fluctuations a number of the company s subsidiaries have a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as such  the consolidated financial results are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly in the euro  swiss franc and pound sterling against the us dollar 
the accumulated foreign currency translation differences at december  of million are reported within accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet and foreign exchange losses for the year to december  of million are reported in the consolidated statements of income 
at december   the company had outstanding swap and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the currency risk associated with intercompany transactions and specific external receivables 
for further information  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this annual report on form k 
at december  the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of million 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially expose shire to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short term cash investments  derivative contracts and trade accounts receivable from product sales and from third parties from which the company receives royalties 
cash is invested in short term money market instruments  including money market and liquidity funds and bank term deposits 
the money market and liquidity funds in which shire invests are all triple a rated by both standard and poor s and by moody s credit rating agencies 
the company is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which it enters into derivative instruments 
the company limits this exposure through a system of internal credit limits which vary according to ratings assigned to the counterparties by the major rating agencies 
the internal credit limits are approved by the board and exposure against these limits is monitored by the corporate treasury function 
the counterparties to these derivatives contracts are major international financial institutions 
the company s revenues from product sales in the us are mainly governed by agreements with major pharmaceutical wholesalers and relationships with other pharmaceutical distributors and retail pharmacy chains 
for the year to december  there were three customers in the us that accounted for of the company s product sales 
however  such customers typically have significant cash resources and as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered acceptable 
the company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions and operates clearly defined credit evaluation procedures 
however  an inability of one or more of these wholesalers to honor their debts to the company could have an adverse effect on company s financial condition and results of operations 
a substantial portion of the company s accounts receivable in countries outside of the united states is derived from product sales to government owned or government supported healthcare providers 
the company s recovery of these accounts receivable is therefore dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of the relevant governments 
in recent years the creditworthiness and general economic condition of a number of eurozone countries including greece  ireland  italy  portugal and spain the relevant countries has deteriorated 
as a result  in some of these countries the company is experiencing delays in the remittance of receivables due from government owned or government supported healthcare providers 
the company continued to receive remittances in relation to government owned or government supported healthcare providers in all the relevant countries in the year to december   including receipts of million and million in respect of spanish and italian receivables  respectively 
to date the company has not incurred significant losses on accounts receivable in the relevant countries  and continues to consider that such accounts receivable are recoverable 
the company will continue to evaluate all its accounts receivable for potential collection risks and has made provision for amounts where collection is considered to be doubtful 
if the financial condition of the relevant countries or other eurozone countries suffer significant deterioration  such that their ability to make payments becomes uncertain  or if one or more eurozone member countries withdraws from the euro  additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required  and losses may be incurred  in future periods 
any such loss could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
for further information  see part ii item a of the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services which are used in the business 
however  the company believes that the net effect of inflation on its revenues and operations has been minimal during the past three years 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap and sec regulations  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to the valuation of intangible assets  sales deductions  income taxes including provisions for uncertain tax positions and the realization of deferred tax assets  provisions for litigation and legal proceedings  contingent consideration receivable from product divestments and contingent consideration payable in respect of business combinations and asset purchases 
if actual results differ from the company s estimates  or to the extent these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the company s results of operations could either benefit from  or be adversely affected by  any such change in estimate 
i valuation of intangible assets in accordance with us gaap the company classifies intangible assets into three categories finite lived intangible assets  which are amortized over their estimated useful lives  intangible assets with indefinite lives  which are not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
at december  the carrying value of the company s finite lived intangible assets was  million  million   million  the carrying value of the company s indefinite lived intangible assets was million million  million  and the carrying value of the company s goodwill was million million  million 
the company s indefinite lived intangible assets relate solely to ipr d assets acquired through business combinations 
a initial valuation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations the company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
any excess of the fair value of consideration given and the fair value of any noncontrolling interest over the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the determination of estimated fair values of acquired intangible assets  as well as the useful economic life ascribed to finite lived intangible assets  requires the use of significant judgement 
the use of different estimates and assumptions to those used by the company could result in a materially different valuation of acquired intangible assets  which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
initial valuation of finite lived intangible assets at december  the carrying value of the company s finite lived intangible assets was  million  million   million  primarily representing the following products vyvanse million  dermagraft product technology million  replagal million  firazyr million and resolor million 
the fair values of all finite lived identifiable intangible assets  for commercialized products and developed product technologies  acquired through business combinations have been determined using an income approach on a project by project basis using the multi period excess earnings method 
the multi period excess earnings method starts with a forecast of all expected future net cash flows which a market participant could have either generated or saved as a result of ownership of the intellectual property  customer relationships  product technologies and other intangible assets 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying a market participant discount rate that reflects the risk factors that a market participant would associate with the cash flows to the extent the underlying cash flows have not similarly been risk adjusted 
the forecast of future cash flows requires various assumptions to be made 
these valuations are based on information at the time of the acquisition of the identifiable intangible assets  and the expectations and assumptions that i have been deemed reasonable by the company s management and ii are based on information  expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such valuations will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecasts of future cash flows  and dependent on the outcome of future events or circumstances impairment losses as outlined below may result 
the use of different estimates and assumptions to those used by the company could result in a materially different valuation of finite lived intangible assets 
however  as the valuation process for intangible assets involves a number of inter relating assumptions  the company does not consider it meaningful to quantify the sensitivity of the valuation of intangible assets to changes in any individual assumption 
initial valuation of indefinite lived intangible assets ipr d ipr d represents the fair value assigned to incomplete technologies and development projects that the company has acquired through business combinations or asset acquisitions  which at the date of the relevant acquisition have not reached technological feasibility or which have no alternative future use 
prior to january  the fair value ascribed to such technologies or development projects was immediately expensed to the consolidated statements of income in the year of acquisition 
additionally  non refundable fees paid on the in licensing of products that have not yet received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use have been expensed and presented within r d in the consolidated statements of income 
for those business combinations which closed subsequent to january  ipr d has been recorded as indefinite lived intangible assets 
at the time of each initial acquisition  the company recorded indefinite lived ipr d assets of million and million on the acquisition of ferrokin and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from pervasis  respectively in  and recorded ipr d assets of million on the acquisition of movetis in the fair value of ipr d assets is determined using the income approach on a project by project basis using the multi period excess earnings method 
the fair value of the acquired ipr d assets has been based on the present value of probability adjusted incremental cash flows which a market participant would expect to be generated by the ipr d projects after the deduction of contributory asset charges for other assets employed in these projects 
this method incorporates an evaluation of the probability of success of each development project  and applying an appropriate market participant discount rate commensurate with the project stage of completion  the nature of the product  the scientific data associated with the technology  the current patent situation and market competition 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely completion of the acquired ipr d projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from ongoing clinical trials  and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals 
the use of different estimates and assumptions to those used by the company could result in a materially different valuation of ipr d 
however  as the valuation process for ipr d involves a number of inter relating assumptions  the company does not consider it meaningful to quantify the sensitivity of the valuation of ipr d to changes in any individual assumption 
the valuation of ipr d has been based on information that existed at the time of the acquisition of the relevant development project  and utilized expectations and assumptions that i have been deemed reasonable by the company s management  and ii are based on information  expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant 
however  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions or estimates associated with the valuation of ipr d will occur as projected 
if certain of the ipr d projects fail during development  are abandoned  or do not receive the relevant regulatory approvals  the company may not realize the future cash flows that it has estimated nor recover the value of the r d investment made subsequent to acquisition of the relevant project 
if such circumstances occur  the company s future operating results could be materially adversely impacted 
b subsequent measurement of intangible assets finite lived intangible assets estimation of amortization charges and impairment losses management s estimate of the useful life of its finite lived intangible assets considers  amongst other things  the following factors i the expected use of the finite lived intangible asset by the company  ii any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit or extend the useful life  iii the effects of demand and competition  including the launch of generic products  and iv other general economic and or industry specific factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels 
the company reviews the useful life of its intangible assets subject to amortization at each reporting period  and revises its estimate of the useful life if warranted by events or circumstances 
any future changes to the useful life of the company s finite lived intangible assets could result in higher or lower amortization charges in future periods  which could materially affect the company s results from operations 
the company reviews its finite lived intangible assets for impairment using a two step approach  whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of its finite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable 
under step one  if the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the finite lived intangible asset based on entity specific assumptions are less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is considered not to be recoverable 
the impairment loss is determined under step two as the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value based on market participant assumptions 
events or circumstances that could suggest that the company s finite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable  and which would lead to an evaluation of the recoverability of the relevant asset  include but are not limited to  the following i changes to a product s commercialization strategy  ii the loss of patent protection  regulatory exclusivity or challenge or circumvention by competitors of the company s regulatory exclusivity patents  iii the development and marketing of competitive products  including generic entrants into the marketplace  iv changes to the product labels  or other regulatory intervention  v sustained government pressure on prices and  specifically  competitive pricing  vi the occurrence of significant adverse events in respect to the company s products  vii a significant deterioration in a product s operating performance compared to expectations  and viii an expectation that the intangible asset will be divested before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the occurrence of any such events or circumstances could adversely affect the company s estimates of the future net cash flows generated by its finite lived intangible assets 
the company has recognized impairment losses of million  to write down its resolor finite lived intangible assets to their fair value in the year to december  nil  million  which related to the daytrana intangible asset as a result of divestment to noven see item of part iv exhibits and financial statement schedules and note  other intangible assets  net to the consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report on form k for details 
dependent on future events or circumstances  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected by future impairment losses relating to its finite lived intangible assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets ipr d estimation of impairment losses the company reviews its indefinite lived intangible assets which currently only relate to ipr d assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
indefinite lived assets are reviewed for impairment using a one step approach  which compares the fair value of the indefinite lived asset based on market participant assumptions with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the relevant indefinite lived intangible asset 
events or circumstances that could suggest that the company s ipr d assets may not be recoverable  and which would lead to an evaluation of the relevant asset for impairment  include those factors considered for finite lived intangible assets outlined above as well as any adverse changes to the technological or commercial viability of the ipr d projects  which could include abandonment or declines in the estimated commercial potential of the relevant ipr d project 
the occurrence of any such events or circumstances could adversely affect the company s estimates of the future net cash flows generated by  and the fair value of  its indefinite lived intangible assets 
after the identification of any such events or circumstances  and the resultant impairment reviews  the company recognized impairment losses of million in the year to december  million  nil to write down its resolor ipr d assets to their fair value see item of part iv exhibits and financial statement schedules and note  other intangible assets  net to the consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report on form k for details 
dependent on future events or circumstances  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected by future impairment losses relating to its indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill estimation of impairment losses the company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level  which for the company is at the same level as its operating segments of sp  hgt and rm at december  goodwill of million december  million is held in the sp segment  million december  million in the hgt segment and million december  million is held in the rm segment 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment using a two step approach 
step one requires a comparison of the fair value of each of the company s reporting units with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of each individual reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill included within that reporting unit is considered impaired  in which case step two is performed 
under step two  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the company determines the fair value of its reporting units and if required in any step two evaluation  the fair value of its goodwill through a present value technique  principally using the income approach 
the determination of fair value of the company s reporting units requires the use of significant judgment and assumptions  which include  amongst other things  the estimation of future forecast cash flows and an appropriate discount rate used to determine the fair value of each of the company s reporting units 
the company s annual goodwill impairment review performed as at october   and indicated that the estimated fair value of each of the company s reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
goodwill was  therefore  not considered impaired 
however  dependent on future events or circumstances  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected by any future impairment losses relating to its goodwill 
ii sales deductions sales deductions consist of statutory rebates to state medicaid and other government agencies  contractual rebates with managed care organizations mcos  product returns  sales discounts including trade discounts  wholesaler chargebacks  and allowances for coupon and patient assistance programs 
these deductions are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales 
estimates of future obligations are derived from historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
on the balance sheet the company records wholesaler chargebacks and trade discounts as a reserve against accounts receivable  whereas all other sales deductions are recorded within current liabilities 
the company has the following significant categories of sales deductions  all of which involve estimates and judgments which the company considers to be critical accounting estimates  and require the company to use information from external sources medicaid and managed care rebates statutory rebates to state medicaid agencies and contractual rebates to mcos under managed care programs are based on statutory or negotiated discounts to the selling price 
medicaid rebates generally increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product if prices increase faster than inflation as it can take up to six months for information to reach the company on actual usage of the company s products in managed care and medicaid programs and on the total rebates to be reimbursed  the company maintains reserves for amounts payable under these programs relating to sold products 
the amount of these reserves is based on historical experience of rebates  the timing of payments  the level of reimbursement claims  changes in prices both normal selling prices and statutory or negotiated prices  changes in prescription demand patterns  projected product returns and the levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
adjustments are made for known changes in these factors 
shire s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel are derived from product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers and results of independently commissioned retail inventory surveys 
revisions or clarification of guidelines from the cms related to state medicaid and other government program reimbursement practices with retroactive application can result in changes to management s estimates of the rebates reported in prior periods 
the accrual estimation process for medicaid and managed care rebates involves in each case a number of interrelating assumptions  which vary for each combination of product and medicaid agency or mco 
accordingly  it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty 
however  shire does not believe that the effect of these uncertainties  taken as a whole  significantly impacts the company s financial condition or results of operations 
aggregate accruals for medicaid and mco rebates at december   and were million  million and million  or  and  respectively of net product sales 
historically  actual rebates have not varied significantly from the reserves provided 
product returns the company typically accepts customer product returns in the following circumstances a expiration of shelf life  b product damaged while in the possession of shire  c under sales terms that allow for unconditional return guaranteed sales  or d following product recalls or product withdrawals 
returns are generally accepted up to one year after expiration date of the relevant product 
the company typically refunds the sales price paid by the customer by issuance of a credit  rather than cash refund or exchanges from inventory  and the returned product is destroyed 
shire estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that will result in a return by considering relevant factors  including i past product returns activity  ii the duration of time taken for products to be returned  iii the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel  iv product recalls and discontinuances  v the shelf life of products  vi the launch of new drugs or new formulations  and vii the loss of patent protection or new competition 
shire s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel are based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers and results of independently commissioned third party retail inventory surveys 
returns reserves for new products and for those products with generic competition generally require a higher level of estimation than those for established products without generic competition 
for shipments made to support the commercial launch of a new product which can include guaranteed sales  the company s policy is to defer recognition of the sales revenue until there is evidence of end patient acceptance of the new product primarily through third party prescription data 
for shipments after launch under standard terms ie not guaranteed sales  the company s initial estimates of sales return accruals are primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products shortly after launch 
once sufficient historical data on actual returns of the product are available  the returns provision is based on this data and any other relevant factors as noted above 
the company estimates returns reserves for products with generic competition based on historical sales  product utilization and rebate data  which are modified through the use of management judgment to take into account many factors  including  but not limited to  current market dynamics  changes in contract terms  changes in sales trends and product pricing 
the accrual estimation process for product returns involves  in each case  a number of interrelating assumptions  which vary for each combination of product and customer 
accordingly  it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty 
however  shire does not believe that the effect of uncertainties  as a whole  significantly impacts the company s financial condition or results of operations 
at december   and  provisions for product returns were million  million  and million or  and respectively  of net product sales 
historically  actual returns have not varied significantly from the reserves provided 
iii income taxes in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  management is required to develop estimates as to whether a tax benefit should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements  based on whether it is more likely than not that the technical merits of the position will be sustained based on audit by the tax authorities 
the measurement of the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements is based upon the largest amount of tax benefit that  in management s judgment  is greater than likely to be realized based on a cumulative probability assessment of the possible outcomes 
in accounting for income tax uncertainties  management is required to make judgments in the determination of the unit of account  the evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information in respect of the tax position taken  together with the estimates of amounts that the company may be required to pay in ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities 
as shire operates globally  the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change and the amounts at issue can be substantial 
shire develops its cumulative probability assessment to measure uncertain tax positions using internal expertise  experience and judgment  together with assistance from professional advisors 
original estimates are refined as additional information becomes known 
for example  in the year to december  the company released certain provisions for uncertain tax positions totaling million  primarily following the conclusion of prior year audits these releases were partially offset by the recognition of additional provisions for uncertain tax positions of million in relation to ongoing compliance management for current and prior years 
any outcome upon settlement that differs from the recorded provision for uncertain tax positions may result in a materially higher or lower tax expense in future periods  which could significantly impact the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  the company does not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such change in assumptions  estimates or judgments and the resultant change  if any  in the company s provision for uncertain tax positions  as any such change is dependent on factors such as future changes in tax law or administrative practice  the amount and nature of additional taxes which may be asserted by the taxation authorities  and the willingness of the relevant tax authorities to negotiate a settlement for any such position 
at december  the company recognized a liability of million for total unrecognized tax benefits million and had accrued million million for the payment of interest and penalties 
the company is required in certain tax jurisdictions to make advance deposits to tax authorities on receipt of a tax assessment 
these payments are either offset against the income tax liability or establish an income tax receivable but do not reduce the provision for unrecognized tax benefits 
the company has significant deferred tax assets due to various tax attributes  including net operating losses nols  tax credits from research and development and investment tax credits principally in the republic of ireland  the us  belgium  germany and the uk 
at december  the company had deferred tax liabilities of million million  million and gross deferred tax assets of million million  million  against which the company had recorded valuation allowances of million million  million 
the realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods 
management is required to exercise judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not that it would realize these deferred tax assets 
where there is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities there will not be sufficient taxable profits to utilize these tax attributes a valuation allowance is held against these deferred tax assets 
if actual events differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  any changes to the valuation allowance could significantly impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
iv litigation and legal proceedings the company has a number of lawsuits pending 
the company s principal pending legal and other proceedings are disclosed in item legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings to the consolidated financial statements set forth in this annual report on form k 
the company recognizes loss contingency provisions for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss 
when the estimated loss lies within a range  the company records a loss contingency provision based on its best estimate of the probable loss 
if no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount is recorded 
estimates of losses are often developed substantially before the ultimate loss is known  and are therefore refined during each accounting period as additional information becomes known 
in instances where the company is unable to develop a reasonable estimate of loss  no loss contingency provision is recorded at that time 
as information becomes known a loss contingency provision is recorded when a reasonable estimate can be made 
the estimates are reviewed quarterly and the estimates are changed when expectations are revised 
an outcome that deviates from the company s estimate may result in an additional expense or release in a future accounting period 
at december  provisions for litigation losses  insurance claims and other disputes totaled million december  million  million 
the outcomes of these proceedings are not always predictable and can be affected by various factors 
for those legal and other proceedings for which it is considered at least reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred  the company discloses the possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the recorded loss contingency provision  if any  where such excess is both material and estimable 
the estimation of the likelihood  amount and range of any loss arising from these proceedings requires significant judgment 
any revisions in the company s estimates  or outcomes upon settlement that deviate from the company s best estimate may result in an additional or lesser expense in a future accounting period  which could materially impact the company s financial condition or results of operations 
v contingent consideration receivable from product divestments consideration receivable by the company on the divestment of product rights typically includes up front receipts and or milestones and royalties which are contingent on the outcome of future events with such milestones and royalties being  for example  based upon the future sales performance of the divested product 
contingent consideration occasionally represents a significant proportion of the economic value receivable by the company for a divested product 
in these situations the company initially recognizes this contingent consideration as an asset at its divestment date fair value  with re measurement of this asset to its then current fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates 
at december  the company has contingent consideration assets of million million  million  related to the divestment of daytrana to noven in october the fair value of this contingent consideration receivable has been estimated using the income approach using a discounted cash flow method 
this discounted cash flow approach uses significant unobservable level inputs as defined in us gaap including forecast future relevant sales of the divested product  the number of years over which such sales will be generated  the relevant contractual royalty rates associated with such sales  an appropriate discount rate to be applied in calculating the present value of forecast future cash inflows  and assumed weightings applied to differing revenue scenarios used to derive a probability weighted fair value 
significant judgment has been employed by the company in developing these estimates and assumptions  both at the date of divestment and in developing assumptions in subsequent periods 
if actual events differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the period of any such change of estimate 
vi contingent consideration payable contingent consideration payable represents the fair value of future amounts the company may be required to pay in conjunction with the ferrokin and pervasis business combinations and the license acquired from mt sinai 
the amount of consideration ultimately payable under these arrangements is dependent on the achievement of certain future development  regulatory and sales milestones and or the level of future royalties payable for the relevant licensed product 
the fair value of the company s contingent consideration payable at december  was million december  nil 
the company re measures its contingent consideration payable to fair value each accounting period 
any changes to the fair value of contingent consideration payables in respect of the ferrokin and pervasis business combinations is recorded to integration and acquisition costs in the company s consolidated income statement 
any changes to the fair value of contingent consideration payable in respect of the license acquired from mt sinai is recorded as an increase decrease to the associated intangible asset  with a prospective adjustment to intangible asset amortization in periods subsequent to any such change 
the company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration payable using the income approach  based on a discounted cash flow method 
the discounted cash flow method uses significant unobservable level inputs as defined under us gaap  including the probability of  and period in which  the relevant milestone event is expected to be achieved  the discount rate to be applied in calculating the present value of the relevant milestone or royalty  and the amount of royalties payable based on forecast net sales of the relevant product 
significant judgment is employed by the company in developing these fair values estimates 
if actual events differ from management s estimates or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  the company s financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected in the period of any such change of estimate 
recent accounting pronouncements update see note x to the consolidated financial statements contained in item exhibits and financial statement schedules of this annual report on form k for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and effects on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
financial information relating to the shire ias trust the results of operations and the financial position of the ias trust are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
an explanation of the ias trust is included in item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities of this annual report 
separate  audited financial statements of the ias trust are included in item exhibits and financial statement schedules of this annual report 
for the year to december  the ias trust recorded income before tax of million million  million 
this income reflected dividends received on the income access share 
at december  the ias trust had total equity of nil 
in future periods  to the extent that dividends are unclaimed on the expiry of dividend checks  or to the extent they are returned unpresented  the ias trust will record a liability for these unclaimed dividends 
the movements in cash and cash equivalents of the ias trust consist of dividends received on the income access share  million  million  million  and distributions made on behalf of shire to shareholders million  million  million 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk treasury policies and organization the company s principal treasury operations are coordinated by its corporate treasury function 
all treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and procedures approved annually by the board of directors 
as a matter of policy  the company does not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its credit  currency or interest rate exposure 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk on restricted cash  cash and cash equivalents and on foreign exchange contracts on which interest is at floating rates 
this exposure is primarily to us dollar  pounds sterling  euro and canadian dollar interest rates 
as the company maintains all of its cash  liquid investments and foreign exchange contracts on a short term basis for liquidity purposes  this risk is not actively managed 
in the year to december  the average interest rate received on cash and liquid investments was less than per annum 
the largest proportion of these cash and liquid investments was in us dollar money market and liquidity funds 
the company incurs interest at a fixed rate of on its  million in principal amount convertible bonds due no derivative instruments were entered into during the year to december  to manage interest rate exposure 
the company continues to review its interest rate risk and the policies in place to manage the risk 
foreign exchange risk the company trades in numerous countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposures 
transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary 
the main trading currencies of the company are the us dollar  pounds sterling  swiss franc and the euro 
it is the company s policy that these exposures are minimized to the extent practicable by denominating transactions in the subsidiary s functional currency 
where significant exposures remain  the company uses foreign exchange contracts being spot  forward and swap contracts to manage the exposure for balance sheet assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary 
these assets and liabilities relate predominantly to intercompany financing and specific external receivables 
the foreign exchange contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments 
cash flows from derivative instruments are presented within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated cash flow statement  unless the derivative instruments are economically hedging specific investing or financing activities 
translational foreign exchange exposure arises on the translation into us dollars of the financial statements of non us dollar functional subsidiaries 
at december  the company had swap and forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding to manage currency risk 
the swaps and forward contracts mature within days 
the company did not have credit risk related contingent features or collateral linked to the derivatives 
at december  the fair value of these contracts was a net liability of million 
further details are included below 
foreign exchange risk sensitivity the following exchange rate sensitivity analysis summarises the sensitivity of the company s reported revenues and net income to hypothetical changes in the average annual exchange rates of the euro  pound sterling and swiss franc against the us dollar  assuming a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar against each of the aforementioned currencies in the year to december  increase reduction in revenues increase reduction in net income m m euro pound sterling swiss franc a weakening of the us dollar against the aforementioned currencies would have an equal and opposite effect 
the table below provides information about the company swap and forward foreign exchange contracts by currency pair 
the table presents the net principal amounts and weighted average exchange rates of all outstanding contracts 
all contracts have a maturity date of less than three months 
december  principal value of weighted amount average fair receivable exchange rate value m m swap foreign exchange contracts receive usd pay eur receive gbp pay usd receive usd pay cad receive usd pay sek receive usd pay aud receive usd pay mxn concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially expose shire to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short term cash investments  derivative contracts and trade accounts receivable from product sales and from third parties from which the company receives royalties 
cash is invested in short term money market instruments  including money market and liquidity funds and bank term deposits 
the money market and liquidity funds in which shire invests are all triple a rated by both standard and poor s and by moody s credit rating agencies 
the company is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which it enters into derivative instruments 
the company limits this exposure through a system of internal credit limits which vary according to ratings assigned to the counterparties by the major rating agencies 
the internal credit limits are approved by the board and exposure against these limits is monitored by the corporate treasury function 
the counterparties to these derivatives contracts are major international financial institutions 
the company s revenues from product sales in the us are mainly governed by agreements with major pharmaceutical wholesalers and relationships with other pharmaceutical distributors and retail pharmacy chains 
for the year to december  there were three customers in the us that accounted for of the company s product sales 
however  such customers typically have significant cash resources and as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered acceptable 
the company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions and operates clearly defined credit evaluation procedures 
however  an inability of one or more of these wholesalers to honor their debts to the company could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a substantial portion of the company s accounts receivable in countries outside of the united states is derived from product sales to government owned or government supported healthcare providers 
the company s recovery of these accounts receivable is therefore dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of the relevant governments 
in recent years the creditworthiness and general economic condition of the relevant countries has deteriorated 
as a result  in some of these countries the company is experiencing delays in the remittance of receivables due from government owned or government supported healthcare providers 
the company s aggregate accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  in total from government owned or government supported healthcare providers in the relevant countries are as follows december  m december  m total accounts receivable  net in the relevant countries total accounts receivable  net in the relevant countries as a percentage of total outstanding accounts receivable  net accounts receivable  net due from government owned or government supported healthcare providers for the relevant countries accounts receivable due from government owned or government supported healthcare providers in the relevant countries of million million are split by country as follows greece million million  ireland million million  italy million million  portugal million million and spain million million 
the company continues to receive remittances in relation to government owned or government supported healthcare providers in the relevant countries and in the year to december  received million in settlement of accounts receivable in the relevant countries million was from greece  million from italy  million from portugal and million from spain 
to date the company has not incurred significant losses on the accounts receivable in the relevant countries  and continues to consider that such accounts receivable are recoverable 
other than the accounts receivable from government owned or supported healthcare providers outlined above  the company does not hold any other government debt from the relevant countries 
additionally the company does not consider it is currently exposed to significant sovereign credit risk outside of the relevant countries 
the company continues to evaluate all its accounts receivable for potential collection risks and has made provision for amounts where collection is considered to be doubtful 
if the financial condition of the relevant countries or other eurozone countries suffer significant deterioration  such that their ability to make payments becomes uncertain  or if one or more eurozone member countries withdraws from the euro  additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required  and losses may be incurred  in future periods 
any such loss could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations
