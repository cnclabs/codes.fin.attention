items management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results and a 
of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are an integrated energy company operating principally in the united states with two major business groups utilities and non regulated energy 
we report our business groups in the following financial segments business group financial segment utilities electric utilities gas utilities non regulated energy power generation coal mining oil and gas on feb 
  we sold enserco  our energy marketing segment  which resulted in this segment being classified as discontinued operations 
our utilities group consists of our electric and gas utilities segments 
our electric utilities segment generates  transmits and distributes electricity to approximately  customers in south dakota  wyoming  colorado and montana and provides natural gas distribution services to approximately  customers of cheyenne light in wyoming 
our gas utilities segment serves approximately  natural gas customers in colorado  iowa  kansas and nebraska 
our non regulated energy group engages in the production of natural gas  crude oil and coal  and the production of electric power through ownership of a portfolio of generating plants  the output energy and capacity of which is sold primarily under mid and long term wholesale contracts 
industry overview recovery from the global economic crisis remained unpredictable in because of ongoing sovereign debt problems  mostly centered in the european union 
slow economic growth continued through reducing energy demand 
energy commodity prices  which were near historic highs in mid  experienced dramatic declines in early while crude oil prices recovered notably from through  natural gas prices have remained low 
domestic crude oil prices continued to be influenced by global factors  including foreign economic conditions especially in china and asia  the policies of opec and other large foreign oil producers  and political tensions and conflict in many regions 
the proliferation of domestic natural gas shale plays in recent years has provided the domestic market an abundant new supply of natural gas 
combined with lower demand from the economic downturn  this new and abundant supply source has created record volumes of natural gas in storage  and reduced domestic natural gas prices 
in fact  the ratio of crude oil to natural gas prices is abnormally high  far in excess of the six to one heating value equivalent ratio 
this trend is likely to continue for the foreseeable future given the expected further development of domestic shale gas reserves 
in the united states  electricity generated from coal is approximately percent  down from approximately percent a decade ago 
according to the us energy information administration  coal consumption in the united states was estimated to decline approximately percent in compared to  offset by a growing demand for coal exports 
although coal prices for the western market continued to experience volatility in with multiple micro and macro influences impacting prices  coal still remains the leading fuel and the cheapest source of energy for us electricity generation 
powder river basin  btu per pound spot prices started the year at ton  then decreased to ton in the summer  but ultimately settled back to ton in late like other industries located in the united states  the energy industry is faced with numerous uncertainties  both short and long term 
many utilities have large capital spending needs over the next few years to replace aging infrastructure  add new assets such as transmission lines and renewable energy resources  and upgrade or replace power generation facilities due to increasingly stringent state and federal emissions regulations 
utility companies generally are less impacted by economic downturns  but the severe recession and prolonged recovery affected demand for energy and the ability of customers to pay their utility bills  particularly in certain parts of the country 
although the recovery in the united states continues to be unpredictable  for credit worthy companies  equity and debt financings were successfully undertaken over the past few years 
the state utility regulatory climate remained relatively constructive among government  industry and consumer representatives 
in the seven state region encompassing our utility operations  regulators were willing to establish rates based on multi year considerations  including fuel and other reasonable cost adjustments  justifiable capital expenditures for maintenance and expansion of energy systems  and a response to environmental concerns through demand management and energy efficiency programs 
challenges remain  however  in obtaining satisfactory rate recovery for utility investments due to the general state of the economy and concern by regulators in various states that utility rate increases may cause further harm to local economies 
in short  over the past year state regulatory commissions and staffs have become more stringent and conservative related to authorized returns and other regulatory mechanisms related to cost recovery 
recent federal administrative and legislative actions have set the stage for an emphasis on increased regulation and government oversight of the energy industry 
the energy marketplace and the company continue to respond to the increased oversight and enforcement activity of ferc  and increased environmental and emissions reviews and mandates 
the sec was active issuing several disclosure requirements in relating to the dodd frank act which apply to the energy industry 
the epa passed rules in that will either require expensive upgrades or the closure of many older coal burning power plants 
state legislatures also remained active on environmental issues  with a majority of states now having adopted some form of renewable energy standard  including some in which we operate 
in addition  several states have passed greenhouse gas emissions legislation  which places limits on the emissions of co and other ghgs 
these known and potential future administrative and legislative actions could have significant macroeconomic consequences  which may impact us  as the associated cost increases may cause a dramatic increase in consumer costs for products and services  including rates for electricity and other energy in the mid to long term 
the november election increased the potential for a new wave of environmental regulations as the president has indicated that the administration would do more to reduce carbon emissions 
the passage of the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of  extended through lower tax rates introduced in and  reduced the estate tax  extended unemployment benefits  reduced the social security portion of payroll taxes for employees  and extended bonus depreciation 
a benefit to our investors  the bill extended through the lower capital gains tax rate introduced by the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of additionally  the bill extended the percent bonus depreciation for business property acquired after sept 
 and placed into service prior to jan 
 this provision provided positive tax benefits for the colorado electric and black hills colorado ipp generation projects completed in in early  additional tax legislation was passed that further extended percent bonus depreciation  which will benefit customers related to cheyenne prairie 
the legislation also increased the tax rate on dividends and capital gains for many taxpayers and utility investors  but not to the extent industry proponents had feared 
over the last decade  the corporate structure of many energy companies underwent evaluation and change  in large part due to efforts to create additional shareholder value 
since before the economic crisis  a number of companies contemplated or implemented a realignment of business lines  reflecting a shift in long term strategies 
some divested certain energy properties to focus on core businesses  such as exiting non regulated power production or energy marketing  in favor of more stable utility operations 
others engaged in mergers and acquisitions with a goal to improve economies of scale and returns to investors 
private equity investors continued to play a role in the changing composition of energy ownership 
many industry analysts cite the need for expanded energy capacity and delivery systems 
they continue to foresee an increase in capital investment across a wide spectrum of energy companies 
many electric and gas utilities must replace aging plant and equipment  and regulators appear willing to provide acceptable rate treatment for additional utility investment  although the current state of the economy makes rate recovery more challenging in the short run 
if warranted based on commodity prices  oil and gas producers will continue to explore for new reserves  particularly natural gas  which will be the primary fuel of choice in light of concern regarding ghg emissions and the need to provide backup generation for renewable energy resources 
the growing focus on environmental regulation made it increasingly more difficult to obtain drilling permits  particularly on federal and native american lands 
however  current low natural gas prices prompted some companies to curtail projects in order to conserve cash during a period of low cash flow and constrained capital markets 
fossil fuel combustion continues to be a contentious domestic and international public policy issue  as many nations  including united states allies  advocate reductions in co and other emissions 
many states now encourage the energy industry to invest in renewable energy resources  such as wind or solar power  or the use of bio mass as a fuel 
in many instances  renewable energy use is mandated by state regulators 
several years ago  the state of california mandated that future imports of power must come from power plants with emission levels no greater than combined cycle natural gas fired plants 
recently proposed epa regulations on ghg emissions are very similar 
such restrictions may alter transmission flow of power in western states  as a large percentage of current power generation in the western grid comes from coal sources 
the power generation industry continues to make improvements in emissions control  both voluntarily and in response to regulatory mandates 
emissions from new coal fired plants are now a small fraction of those produced by power plants built a generation ago 
with similar technological progress  coal can and likely will remain an important  domestically available  and economical national energy resource that is vital to meet growing energy demand 
in that regard  the doe is beginning to take positive steps toward ensuring the future of coal through research funding for clean coal technologies and methods of carbon capture and sequestration 
energy providers  government authorities and private interests continue to address issues concerning electric transmission  power generation capacity  the use of renewable and other diversified sources of energy  crude oil and natural gas pipelines and storage  and other infrastructure requirements 
in the short term  prevailing economic conditions will reduce industrial and retail energy consumption 
despite public and private efforts to promote conservation and efficiency  however  the demand for energy is expected to increase steadily over the long term 
to meet this demand growth  the industry will need to provide capital  resources and innovation to serve customers cost effectively  and to achieve suitable returns on investment 
we believe that we are well positioned in this industry setting  and able to proceed with our key business objectives 
along with industry counterparts  we are preparing to address the challenges discussed in this overview  such as new environmental regulations and mandates  renewable portfolio standards  co related taxes or trading practices  credit market conditions  inflation  or other factors that may affect energy demand and supply 
in particular  we are sensitive to additional costs that can negatively affect our customers or our profitability 
to that end  we intend to work closely with regulators and industry leaders to assure that cost conscious proposals and solutions are carefully explored in public policy proceedings 
business strategy we are a customer focused integrated energy company 
our business is comprised of electric and natural gas utilities  power generation assets  and fuel assets which produce coal  crude oil and natural gas 
our focus on customers whether they are utility customers or non regulated energy customers provides opportunities to expand our businesses by constructing additional rate base assets to serve our utility customers and expanding our non regulated energy holdings to provide additional products and services to our wholesale customers 
the diversity of our energy operations reduces reliance on any single business segment to achieve our strategic objectives 
our emphasis on our utility businesses with diverse geography and fuel mix  combined with a conservative approach to our non regulated energy operations  mitigates our overall corporate risk and enhances our ability to earn stronger returns for shareholders over the long term 
despite challenging conditions in the capital markets over the past few years  we have demonstrated our ability to access the debt and equity markets  resulting in sufficient liquidity and solid cash flows 
consequently  our financial foundation is sound and capable of supporting an expansion of operations in both the near and long term 
our long term strategy focuses on growing both our utility and non regulated energy businesses  primarily by increasing our customer base and providing superior service to both utility and non regulated energy customers 
in our natural gas and electric utilities  we intend to significantly grow our asset base to serve projected customer demand and to comply with environmental mandates in our existing utility service territories through expansion of infrastructure and construction of new rate based power generation facilities 
if the opportunity arises  we will pursue acquisitions of additional utility properties  primarily in the great plains and rocky mountain regions of the country 
by maintaining our high customer service and reliability standards in a cost efficient manner  our goal is to secure appropriate rate recovery to provide solid economic returns on our utility investments 
we will continue to prudently grow and develop our existing inventory of crude oil and natural gas reserves  while we strive to maintain strong relationships with mineral owners  landowners and regulatory authorities 
we intend to focus our near term efforts on proving up the substantial mancos shale gas potential of our san juan and piceance basin properties 
given increased regulatory emphasis on wind and solar power generation  and potential environmental regulations and legislation that may limit construction of new coal fired power plants  we believe that natural gas will be the near term fuel of choice for power generation 
additional gas fired peaking resources will also be required to provide critical back up supplies for renewable technologies 
given the amount of electricity currently generated in the united states from coal fired power plants  it will take decades and significant expense before this generation can be replaced with alternative technologies 
as a result  coal fired resources will remain a necessary component of the nation s electric supply for the foreseeable future 
the current regulatory climate  combined with the epa proposed and expected ghg regulations  will likely limit construction of new conventional coal fired power plants  but technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration should provide for the long term economic use of coal 
we have and will continue to investigate the possible deployment of these technologies at our mine site in wyoming and will continue efforts to develop additional markets for our coal production  including the possible development of additional power plants at our mine site 
we have expertise in permitting  constructing and operating power generation facilities 
these skills  combined with our understanding of electric resource planning and regulatory procedures  provide a significant opportunity for us to add long term shareholder value 
we intend to grow our non regulated power generation business by continuing to focus on long term contractual relationships with other load serving utilities 
key elements of our business strategy provide stable long term rates for customers and increase earnings by efficiently planning  constructing and operating rate base power generation facilities needed to serve our electric utilities 
our company began as a vertically integrated electric utility  and this business model remains a core strength and strategy today  as we invest in and operate efficient power generation resources to cost effectively transmit and distribute electricity to our customers 
we provide power at reasonable rates to our customers  and earn competitive returns for our investors 
we have a competitive power production strategy 
our access to coal and natural gas reserves allows us to be competitive as a power generator 
low production costs can result from a variety of factors  including low fuel costs  efficiency in converting fuel into energy  and low per unit operation and maintenance costs 
we leverage the mine mouth coal fired generating capacity which strengthens our position as a low cost producer by eliminating fuel transportation costs which often represent the largest component of the delivered cost of coal for many other utilities 
in addition  we typically operate our plants with high levels of availability  as compared to industry benchmarks 
we aggressively manage each of these factors with the goal of achieving low production costs 
rate base generation assets offer several advantages for consumers  regulators and investors 
first  since the generating assets are included in the utility rate base and reviewed and approved by government authorities  customer rates are more stable than if the power was purchased from the open market through wholesale contracts that are renegotiated over time 
second  regulators participate in a planning process where long term investments are designed to match long term energy demand 
third  investors are assured that a long term  reasonable  stable rate of return may be earned on their investment 
a lower risk profile may also improve credit ratings which  in turn  can benefit both consumers and investors by lowering our cost of capital 
examples of our progress include the january completion of wygen ii to serve the customers of cheyenne light  the april completion of wygen iii to serve the customers of black hills power  and the january completion of a megawatt gas fired power plant to serve the customers of colorado electric 
due to existing legislation in colorado  we plan to retire colorado electric s wn clark plant by dec 
 and epa regulations covering hazardous air pollutants will necessitate the retirement of several of our other older coal fired power plants  including black hills power s osage  ben french and neil simpson i plants in march we are replacing some of these facilities with cheyenne prairie s rate based natural gas fired power plants 
for customers in states without renewable or co mandates  such as south dakota and wyoming  we have constructed mine mouth  state of the art  cost efficient  coal fired facilities  such as wygen ii and wygen iii 
given the current environmental regulatory climate  it is unlikely we could secure a permit to construct additional coal fired generation in the next several years  but we are monitoring developments associated with alternative coal fired generation technologies  including igcc and carbon capture and sequestration  though both appear cost prohibitive in the near term 
these technologies may become cost effective in the future if regulatory or legislative actions place a sufficiently high price on co 

emissions or further technological advancements reduce the costs of those technologies 
the location of our coal mine and power plant complex in the powder river basin of wyoming provides key strategic advantages for carbon capture and sequestration projects  such as readily available saline aquifers for the injection and sequestration of co  as well as a potential co 

market for use in enhanced oil recovery projects 
additionally  the wyoming legislature has been proactive in passing legislation to address pore space ownership  injection regulations and other legal issues associated with the underground sequestration of co proactively integrate alternative and renewable energy into our utility energy supply while mitigating and remaining mindful of customer rate impacts 
the energy and utility industries face tremendous uncertainty related to the potential impact of legislation and regulation intended to reduce ghg emissions and increase the use of renewable and other alternative energy sources 
to date  many states have enacted and others are considering some form of mandatory renewable energy standard  requiring utilities to meet certain thresholds of renewable energy use 
additionally  many states have either enacted or are considering legislation setting ghg emissions reduction targets 
federal legislation for both renewable energy standards and ghg emission reductions is also under consideration 
mandates for the use of renewable energy or the reduction of ghg emissions will likely produce substantial increases in the prices for electricity and natural gas 
at the same time  however  as a regulated utility we are responsible for providing safe  reasonably priced  reliable sources of energy to our customers 
as a result  we have developed a customer centered strategy for complying with renewable energy standards and ghg emission reductions that balances our customers rate concerns with environmental considerations and administrative and legislative mandates 
we attempt to strike this balance by prudently and proactively incorporating renewable energy into our resource supply  while seeking to minimize the magnitude and frequency of rate increases for our utility customers 
examples of our balanced approach include in states such as south dakota and wyoming that currently have no legislative mandate on the use of renewable energy  we have proactively integrated cost effective renewable energy into our generation supply based upon our expectation that there will be mandatory renewable energy standards in the future 
for example  under two year ppas we purchase a total of megawatts of wind energy from wind farms located near cheyenne  wyoming for use at black hills power and cheyenne light  colorado and montana have legislative mandates regarding the use of renewable energy 
therefore  we aggressively pursue cost effective initiatives with the regulators that will allow us to meet our renewable energy requirements 
to the extent practical  we intend to construct renewable generation resources as rate base assets  which will help mitigate the long term customer rate impact of adding renewable energy supplies 
for example  the cpuc approved a megawatt wind turbine project  completed in the fourth quarter of  in which we are permitted to rate base percent ownership as part of our plan to meet colorado s renewable energy standard 
the busch ranch site also has significant expansion potential  and in all states in which we conduct electric utility operations  we are exploring other potential biomass  solar and wind energy projects  particularly wind generation sites located near our utility service territories 
expand utility operations through selective acquisitions of electric and gas utilities consistent with our regional focus and strategic advantages 
for more than years we have provided reliable utility services  delivering quality and value to our customers 
our tradition of accomplishment supports efforts to expand our utility operations into other markets  most likely in areas that permit us to take advantage of our intrinsic competitive advantages  such as baseload power generation  system reliability  superior customer service  community involvement and a relationship based approach to regulatory matters 
the acquisition of cheyenne light and the aquila transaction are examples of such expansion efforts 
utility operations also enhance other important business development opportunities  including gas transmission pipelines and storage infrastructure  which could promote other non regulated energy operations 
utility operations can contribute substantially to the stability of our long term cash flows  earnings and dividend policy 
we have and will continue to pursue the purchase of small private gas distribution systems  which can be easily integrated into our operations 
we purchased several small systems in kansas and iowa in the past two years 
we have a platform of systems and processes which are scalable  which should simplify the integration of potential future utility acquisitions 
merger and acquisition activity in the utility industry has increased in the last year 
we believe that impacts of the current recession may produce opportunities for healthy utility companies to acquire utility assets and operations of other companies on attractive terms and conditions 
we expect to consider such opportunities if we believe they would further our long term strategy and help maximize shareholder value 
build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale power customers of both our utilities and non regulated power generation business 
we strive to build strong relationships with other utilities  municipalities and wholesale customers and believe we will continue to be a primary provider of electricity to wholesale utility customers 
we further believe that these entities will continue to need products  such as capacity  in order to reliably serve their customers 
by providing these products under long term contracts  we are able to help our customers meet their energy needs 
through this approach  we also believe we can earn more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling energy into more volatile spot markets 
in addition  relationships that we ve established with wholesale power customers have developed into other opportunities 
mean and mdu  both wholesale power customers  are now also joint owners in two of our power plants  wygen i and wygen iii  respectively 
selectively grow our non regulated power generation business in targeted regional markets by developing assets and selling most of the capacity and energy production through mid and long term contracts primarily to load serving utilities 
while much of our recent power plant development has been for our regulated utilities  we intend to continue to expand our non regulated power generation business by developing and operating power plants in regional markets based on prevailing supply and demand fundamentals in a manner that complements our existing fuel assets and marketing capabilities 
we intend to grow this business through a combination of the development of new power generation facilities and disciplined acquisitions primarily in the western region where we believe our detailed knowledge of market and electric transmission fundamentals provides us a competitive advantage and  consequently  increases our ability to earn attractive returns 
we expect to prioritize small scale facilities that serve incremental growth or provide critical back up to renewable resources  and are typically easier to permit and construct than large scale generation projects 
most of the energy and capacity from our non regulated power facilities is sold under mid and long term contracts 
when possible  we structure long term contracts as tolling arrangements  whereby the contract counterparty assumes the fuel risk 
going forward  we will continue to focus on selling a majority of our non regulated capacity and energy primarily to load serving utilities under long term agreements that have been reviewed or approved by state utility commissions 
an example of this strategy is the megawatts of combined cycle gas fired generation constructed by our non regulated power generation subsidiary to serve our colorado electric utility subsidiary 
the plant commenced operations on jan 
  under a year tolling agreement 
with respect to our current power sale agreements  two of our long term power contracts provide for the sale of capacity and energy to cheyenne light from our gillette ct and wygen i plants 
the gillette ct contract expires in the wygen i contract expires in  and provides an option for cheyenne light to purchase and rate base black hills wyoming s portion of wygen i 
increase the value of our oil and gas properties by prudently growing our reserves and increasing our production of natural gas and crude oil 
our strategy is to cost effectively grow our reserves and increase our production of natural gas and crude oil through both organic growth and acquisitions 
while consistent growth remains our objective  we realize the necessity of managing for value creation over managing for growth as follows through detailed reservoir analysis  apply proven technologies to our existing assets to maximize value  participate in a limited number of selective and meaningful exploration prospects  primarily focus on the rocky mountain region  where we can more easily integrate new opportunities with our existing crude oil and natural gas operations as well as our power generation activities 
specifically  we intend to focus our near term efforts on fully developing the substantial shale gas potential of our san juan and piceance basin properties and participating in select oil exploration prospects with substantial upside opportunities  support the future capital requirements of our drilling program by stabilizing cash flows with a hedging program that mitigates commodity price risk for a portion of our established production for up to two years in the future  and enhance our crude oil and natural gas production activities with the construction or acquisition of mid stream gathering  compression and treating facilities in a manner that maximizes the economic value of our operations 
diligently manage the credit  price and operational risks inherent in buying and selling energy commodities 
all of our operations require effective management of counterparty credit risk 
we mitigate this risk by conducting business with a diverse group of creditworthy counterparties 
in certain cases where creditworthiness merits security  we require prepayment  secured letters of credit or other forms of financial collateral 
we establish counterparty credit limits and employ continuous credit monitoring  with regular review of compliance under our credit policy by our executive credit committee 
our oil and gas and power generation operations require effective management of price and operational risks related to adverse changes in commodity prices and the volatility and liquidity of the commodity markets 
to mitigate these risks  we implemented risk management policies and procedures 
our oversight committees monitor compliance with these policies 
maintain an investment grade credit rating and ready access to debt and equity capital markets 
access to capital has been and will continue to be critical to our success 
we will require access to the capital markets to fund our planned capital investments or  when possible  to make strategic acquisitions that prudently grow our businesses 
our access to adequate and cost effective financing depends upon our ability to maintain our investment grade issuer credit rating 
we completed several key financings during  including renewing our million revolving credit facility and extending a million term loan 
prospective information we expect to generate long term growth through the expansion of integrated and diverse energy operations 
we recognize that sustained growth requires continued capital deployment 
our diversified energy portfolio with an emphasis on regulated utilities provides growth opportunities  yet avoids concentrating business risk 
we expect much of our growth in the next few years will come from major capital investments at our existing business segments 
during  we refinanced our revolving credit facility and term loans on favorable terms 
although dependent on market conditions  we are confident in our ability to obtain additional financing to continue our growth plans 
we remain focused on managing our operations cautiously and maintaining our overall liquidity to meet our operating  capital and financing needs  as well as executing our long term strategic plan 
utilities group electric utilities our electric utilities benefited from warm summer weather and an increase in rates resulting from rate cases approved for colorado electric and cheyenne light 
the new rates for colorado electric were effective jan 
 upon commercial operation of a megawatt gas fired generation facility that now serves colorado electric customers 
new rates for cheyenne light were effective on july  the addition of the new generation facility for colorado electric to our utility rate base and the successful approval of our rate case had a significant positive impact on our financial results 
pursuant to prior approved resource plans  the electric utilities engaged in the following regulatory requests for construction activities during the wpsc approved the cpcn for cheyenne light and black hills power to construct a new jointly owned megawatt generating facility in cheyenne  wyo 
with an expected commercial operation date in the fourth quarter of cheyenne light and black hills power also received approval from the wpsc to use a construction financing rider for cheyenne prairie in lieu of traditional afudc 
this allows cheyenne light and black hills power to earn and collect a rate of return during the construction period on approximately a percent share of the project costs related to serving wyoming customers  while also lowering the overall cost of the project to customers 
this rider was effective nov 
  resulting in an increase to gross margin of million in  and it will increase gross margin in and by approximately million and million  respectively 
a request for a similar rider was made to the sdpuc 
the sdpuc approved interim rates for that rider  effective april   which will increase gross margin by approximately million and million in and  respectively 
interim rates are subject to refund until final approval is received  colorado electric completed construction of a megawatt wind project as part of our plan to meet colorado s renewable energy standards 
it was placed into commercial operation on oct 
 and colorado electric owns a percent interest in this wind project 
on jan 
  colorado electric received approval notification from the united states treasury for an award letter grant of million for our share of the busch ranch wind project  and on july   colorado electric filed its electric resource plan with the cpuc seeking to develop and own replacement capacity for the retirement of the coal fired wn clark power plant  consistent with a prior cpuc order that had ordered the plant to be retired per the requirements of the colorado clean air clean jobs act 
the cpuc dismissed the initial filing without prejudice and directed colorado electric to refile the resource plan and address alternatives for not just the replacement capacity for its coal fired wn clark power plant  but also for the retirement of the aging natural gas fired steam turbines  pueblo units and on review  the cpuc confirmed colorado electric s right to own the replacement energy for the wn clark power plant and extended the date to refile the resource plan to may  gas utilities unseasonably warm winter weather adversely impacted results at our gas utilities 
our gas utilities are focused on the continued investment in our gas distribution network and related technology such as advanced metering infrastructure and mobile data terminals 
we continually monitor our investments and costs of operations in all states to determine when additional rate cases or other rate filings will be necessary 
as part of our growth strategy  we continue to look for opportunities to purchase municipal and rural gas infrastructure and the distribution systems 
we acquired two small gas systems during with a total of customers 
non regulated energy group power generation our power generation segment was awarded the bid to provide megawatts of power to our colorado electric subsidiary through a year ppa 
construction for a megawatt combined cycle natural gas fired power generation facility in colorado was completed in december and this facility commenced commercial operation on jan 
 we plan to continue evaluating opportunities to bid on the construction of generation resources  both new and existing  for other regional electric utilities for their energy and capacity needs 
coal mining production from the coal mining segment primarily serves mine mouth generation plants and select regional customers with long term fuel needs 
total annual production is estimated to be approximately million tons for  which is consistent with annual production decreased in primarily due to the termination of the pacificorp dave johnston power plant contract which expired at the end of however  the termination of this contract had a positive impact on earnings since the pricing of this contract was such that we were not recovering our costs during the latter periods of the agreement 
in the second quarter of  the coal mine commenced operations under a revised mine plan 
mining operations moved to an area with lower overburden ratios  which should reduce mining costs for the next several years 
our primary strategy is to sell the majority of our coal production to on site  mine mouth generation facilities under long term supply contracts 
historically our off site sales have been to consumers within a close proximity to our mine 
we have recently extended two smaller volume off site sales contracts served by truck 
there are some limitations in regards to transporting our lower heat content coal  however  we continue to pursue new opportunities to market our coal 
oil and gas during much of  bhep s mission was to identify future investment opportunities while conserving capital and strictly controlling costs 
in september  we sold approximately percent of our bakken and three forks shale assets in the williston basin in north dakota representing gross wells and approximately  net leasehold acres for approximately million 
the sale reduced the full cost pool by million which will reduce our depreciation  depletion and amortization rate in the future 
we will continue our efforts into to develop attractive oil and gas investment opportunities 
corporate on feb 
  we entered into a new five year million revolving credit facility at favorable terms  and on oct 
  we redeemed our million senior unsecured percent bonds early with the proceeds from the sale of the oil and gas assets 
repayment of this debt will significantly lower our interest expense in as of dec 
  we had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million  which do not currently qualify for hedge accounting treatment provided by accounting standards for derivatives and hedges 
accordingly  all mark to market adjustments on these swaps are recorded through the income statement 
as of dec 
  the mark to market value of these swaps was a liability of million 
in  we recorded an unrealized mark to market after tax gain of million on these swaps

new rates were effective july  on june   colorado gas filed a request with the cpuc for an increase in annual gas revenues to recover capital investments and increased operation and maintenance expenses 
the filing was required by the cpuc as part of a rate case settlement 
the cpuc approved a million revenue increase with new rates effective dec 
 the settlement includes a return on equity of percent and a capital structure of percent equity and percent debt 
utility results were unfavorably impacted by warm weather  particularly at the gas utilities 
our service territories reported warmer winter weather  as measured by degree days  compared to the year average and the prior year 
heating degree days year to date were percent lower than weighted average norms for our gas utilities 
when compared to colder than normal weather during the same period in  heating degree days were percent lower than the same period in for our gas utilities 
for our electric utilities  although summer temperatures were above normal  weather related demand was tempered by lower humidity in than in our service territories 
cheyenne light and black hills power received final approvals and permits for cheyenne prairie 
the wpsc approved the cpcn authorizing the construction  operation and maintenance for the new megawatt natural gas fired electric generation facility and related gas and electric transmission in cheyenne  wyo

  partially offset by increased tons sold to the wyodak plant that experienced an outage in approximately percent of our current coal production is sold under contracts that include price adjustments based on actual mining cost increases 
operations and maintenance decreased due to reduced overburden moved associated with lower sales volumes related to the expiration of an unprofitable train load out contract on dec 
 additionally  a revised mine plan resulted in fuel cost and headcount reductions 
depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased primarily due to lower equipment usage and lower depreciation of mine reclamation asset retirement costs 
interest income  net decreased primarily due to a decrease in inter company notes receivable upon payment of a dividend to the parent 
other income  net was comparable to the same period in the prior year 
income tax benefit expense the low effective tax rate in was primarily due to the impact of percentage depletion and a tax return true up  while was impacted by a favorable research and development credit 
compared to revenue increased primarily due to a percent increase in average price per ton partially offset by a percent decrease in volumes sold as a result of overhauls and unplanned outages at the pacificorp operated wyodak plant 
the higher average sales price reflects the impact of price escalators and adjustments in certain of our sales contracts 
in  approximately percent of our coal production was sold under contracts that include price adjustments based on actual mining costs 
most of our remaining production is sold under contracts where the sales price may escalate based on published indices 
these escalators have not kept up with actual mining cost increases  reducing coal mine operating income and negatively impacting results 
one of these contracts  representing percent of the tons sold during  was terminated at dec 
 operations and maintenance increased reflecting longer haul distances and higher overburden stripping costs in the current phase of our mining 
additionally  we experienced higher costs associated with drilling and blasting  equipment maintenance  clay parting removal  fuel  staffing levels for our train load out facility and weather conditions 
as noted above  a portion of our production is sold under contracts that have price escalators based on published indices 
these escalators have not kept up with actual mining cost increases  reducing coal mine operating income and negatively impacting results 
one of these contracts  representing percent of the tons sold during  was terminated at dec 
 previous periods also include the capitalization of certain costs associated with mine infrastructure  including our in pit conveyor system used to transport coal to mine mouth generation facilities

the increased depletion rate in is primarily driven by the high cost of wells associated with our drilling activities in the bakken shale formation 
the depletion rate for the nine months prior to the williston basin sale was per mcfe and per mcfe for the remaining three months of subsequent to the sale 
the reduction in the full cost pool due to the sale of our williston basin assets should significantly decrease the depletion per mcfe rate in see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report filed on form k

the following is a summary of our proved oil and gas reserves at dec 
bbls of oil in thousands mmcf of natural gas total mmcfe reserves are based on reports prepared by an independent consulting and engineering firm 
the reports were prepared by cg a 
reserves were determined using sec defined product prices 
such reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and may be subject to revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the current estimate takes into account production of approximately bcfe  additions from extensions  discoveries and acquisitions of bcfe and negative revisions to previous estimates of bcfe  primarily due to reserve aging 
reserves reflect sec defined pricing held constant for the life of the reserves  as follows oil gas oil gas oil gas nymex prices well head reserve prices compared to revenue was comparable to prior year 
crude oil volumes sold increased percent along with a percent increase in the average price received for crude oil sales  partially offset by a percent decrease in natural gas and ngl volumes sold and a percent decrease in average price received for natural gas 
crude oil production increases reflect volumes from new wells in the bakken shale formation prior to the sale of a majority of those assets on sept 
 operations and maintenance increased primarily due to higher costs from non operated wells and higher compensation and benefit costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased primarily due to the year to date impact from adjusting our expected reserves 
this was caused by commodity price reserve revisions  as well as higher cost reserves associated with our remaining bakken activities and a higher depletion rate per mcfe on higher volumes prior to the sale of most of our williston basin assets 
gain on sale of operating assets represents the gain on the sale of our williston basin assets 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities  which typically does not allow for gain on sale recognition unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
the remainder of the sale amount not recognized as gain reduced the full cost pool and should significantly decrease the future depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
impairment of long lived assets represents a write down in the value of our natural gas and crude oil properties driven by low natural gas prices in the second quarter of the write down reflected a month average nymex price of per mcf  adjusted to per mcf at the wellhead  for natural gas  and per barrel  adjusted to per barrel at the wellhead  for crude oil 
interest expense  net decreased primarily due to decreased debt as a result of the sale of the williston basin assets along with lower interest rates 
other income  net was comparable to the prior period 
income tax benefit expense the effective tax rate for was positively impacted by a research and development credit and the benefit generated by percentage depletion had a lesser impact on the effective tax rate in compared to revenue increased primarily due to a percent increase in the annual average hedged price received for crude oil and a percent increase in crude oil production  partially offset by a percent decrease in the annual average hedged price received for natural gas 
the increase in crude oil production is primarily due to production from new wells in our ongoing bakken drilling program 
natural gas production increased slightly as production from new wells has more than offset natural production declines in existing producing properties  which followed reduced capital deployment during and operations and maintenance increased primarily as a result of increased production taxes from higher revenue 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased primarily due to a higher depletion rate per mcfe 
the increasing depletion rate is primarily driven by the high cost of wells associated with our oil drilling activities in the bakken shale formation 
interest expense  net increased primarily due to increased debt used to finance additional capital expenditures and higher interest rates 
other income  net decreased primarily due to lower earnings from our equity investments 
income tax benefit expense the effective tax rate in both and includes a tax benefit related to percentage depletion 
the effect of such benefit on the effective tax rate was more pronounced in additionally  includes a million re measurement of a previously recorded uncertain tax position prompted by a settlement agreement with the irs appeals division 
corporate corporate results represent unallocated costs for administrative activities that support the business segments 
corporate also includes business development activities that do not fall under the two business groups as well as allocated costs associated with discontinued operations that could not be included in discontinued operations 
compared to corporate results for included costs related to early retirement of debt and refinancing of debt in the amount of million and an unrealized  non cash mark to market gain on certain interest rate swaps of approximately million compared to an unrealized  non cash mark to market loss of million on these interest rate swaps for the year ended dec 
 costs of million previously allocated to our energy marketing segment were reclassified to the corporate segment consistent with accounting for discontinued operations for the year ended dec 
 compared to million in compared to corporate results for included a million unrealized mark to market loss in related to certain interest rate swaps compared to a million unrealized mark to market loss in on those same interest rate swaps 
additionally  corporate results included million of costs originally allocated to our energy marketing segment in which consistent with accounting for discontinued operations could not be included in discontinued operations compared to million in discontinued operations on feb 
  we sold the outstanding stock of enserco  our energy marketing segment 
the transaction was completed through a stock purchase agreement and certain other ancillary agreements 
net cash proceeds on dec 
 were approximately million  subject to final post closing adjustments 
the proceeds represent million received from the buyer and million cash retained from enserco before closing 
income loss from discontinued operations was million and million for the twelve months ended dec 
 and  respectively 
results for include an after tax loss on sale of million including transaction related costs  net of tax benefit of million 
pursuant to the provisions of the stock purchase agreement  disputes regarding post closing purchase price adjustments are subject to arbitration before a nationally recognized accounting firm and all other disputes are subject to the indemnification procedures in the agreement 
the buyer originally demanded an amount totaling million  characterizing all claims in such demand as purchase price adjustments 
we contested certain claims in the buyer demand  including whether certain claims were properly characterized as purchase price adjustments  but reached a partial settlement and paid the buyer the sum of million 
the parties were unable to reach a negotiated agreement regarding the balance of the claims 
in december  we agreed to arbitrate the claims that we believe are properly characterized as purchase price adjustments  but objected to the arbitration of the claims that we believe are not properly characterized as purchase price adjustments 
after joint discussions of the parties with the arbitrator  in january the arbitrator advised the parties that it would not arbitrate the claims to which we objected 
on feb 
  the buyer filed a petition in the united states district court for the district of colorado applying for an order compelling arbitration on all of the disputed claims 
we will respond to this litigation  requesting the court to deny the buyer application 
the filing of this petition does not alter our characterization or evaluation of the original claim 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in application 
there are also areas which require management s judgment in selecting among available gaap alternatives 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from our estimates and to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
the following discussion of our critical accounting estimates should be read in conjunction with note  business description and significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
goodwill we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of november each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the asset might be impaired 
accounting standards for testing goodwill for impairment require a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level 
our reporting units have been determined to be at the operating segment level 
the first step of this test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value under the first step  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based on discounted future cash flows  and a market approach  which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries 
these valuations require significant judgments  including  but not limited to estimates of future cash flows  based on our internal five year business plans with long range cash flows estimated using a terminal value calculation and adjusted as appropriate for our view of market participant assumptions  estimates of long term growth rates for our businesses  the determination of an appropriate weighted average cost of capital or discount rate  and the utilization of market information such as recent sales transactions for comparable assets within the utility and energy industries 
we have million in goodwill as of dec 
 the results of our nov 
 annual impairment test indicated that our goodwill was not impaired  as the estimated fair value of all reporting units exceeded their carrying value 
although an impairment did not exist as of nov 
  we determined that one reporting unit  colorado electric with goodwill of million  had an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying value by only percent  which we do not consider a substantial excess 
the result of our valuation analysis estimates colorado electric fair value at million  compared to a carrying value of million as of nov 
 the result of the income approach was sensitive to the percent long term cash flow growth rate applicable to periods beyond our internal five year business plan financial forecast and the percent weighted average cost of capital assumptions 
as an illustration of this sensitivity  an increase of percent in the cost of capital combined with a growth rate reduction of percent would result in an estimated fair value in excess of carrying value of million or percent as of nov 
 full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method whereby all productive and nonproductive costs related to acquisition  exploration  development  abandonment and reclamation activities are capitalized 
these costs are amortized using a unit of production method based on volumes produced and proved reserves 
any conveyances of properties  including gains or losses on abandonments of properties  are generally treated as adjustments to the cost of the properties with no gain or loss recognized 
net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
this method values the reserves based upon sec defined prices for oil and gas as of the end of each reporting period adjusted for contracted price changes 
the prices  as well as costs and development capital  are assumed to remain constant for the remaining life of the properties 
if the net capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  then a permanent non cash write down is required to be charged to earnings in that reporting period 
under these sec defined product prices  our net capitalized costs were more than the full cost ceiling at june   which required a write down of million after tax 
under the sec defined product prices at dec 
  no additional write down was required 
reserves in and were determined consistent with sec requirements using a month average price calculated using the first day of the month price for each of the months in the reporting period held constant for the life of the properties 
because of the fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices  we can provide no assurance that future write downs will not occur 
as noted  we utilize the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities in accordance with sec rule of regulation s x rule 
under the full cost method  sales of oil and gas properties generally are recorded as an adjustment to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between the capitalized costs and proved oil and gas reserves 
the company s sale of oil and gas properties in the williston basin of north dakota was significant as defined by rule and  accordingly  an million after tax gain on sale was recorded 
total net cash proceeds from the sale were approximately million 
under the guidance of rule  if a gain or loss is recognized on such a sale  total capitalized costs shall be allocated between the reserves sold and the reserves retained on the same basis used to compute amortization  unless there are substantial economic differences between the properties sold and those retained  in which case capitalized costs shall be allocated on the basis of the relative fair value of the properties in the cost center 
because of the substantial differences between the crude oil properties we sold and those properties retained  which were predominantly natural gas  we allocated based on relative fair values 
if a different method of allocating the capitalized costs was chosen  the gain recorded on our transaction could vary substantially 
for example  if the allocation was made on the same basis used to compute amortization as noted within rule and we utilized the ratio of proven reserve quantities from the properties sold compared to total proven reserve quantities in our cost center  we would have recorded a gain on sale of approximately million 
because of the value associated with the undeveloped acreage sold  we did not believe this was an appropriate methodology for allocation 
any change in the gain recorded would impact the amount of adjustment to our capitalized costs therefore impacting future depletion expense recorded within our financial statements 
oil and natural gas reserve estimates estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
an independent petroleum engineering company prepares reports that estimate our proved oil and natural gas reserves annually 
the accuracy of any oil and natural gas reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and work over costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as oil and gas prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves may also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in estimating our oil and natural gas reserves  the estimates are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense  the amortization rate of our capitalized oil and gas properties incorporates the estimated unit of production attributable to the estimates of proved reserves 
the net book value of our oil and gas properties is also subject to a ceiling limitation based in large part on the value of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
risk management activities in addition to the information provided below  see note  risk management activities and note  fair value measurement  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
derivatives accounting standards for derivatives require the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and their measurement at fair value 
our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative 
the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or fair values 
the effective portion of changes in fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss until it is reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in current earnings 
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized in current earnings along with fair value changes of the underlying hedged item 
we currently use derivative instruments  including options  swaps  futures  forwards and other contractual commitments for non trading hedging purposes 
our typical hedging transactions relate to contracts we enter into to fix the price received for anticipated future production at our oil and gas segment  or to fulfill the natural gas hedging plans for gas and electric utilities see below  and for interest rate swaps we enter into to convert a portion of our variable rate debt  or associated variable rate interest payments  to a fixed rate 
fair values of derivative instruments contracts are based on actively quoted market prices or other external source pricing information  where possible 
if external market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors and pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recorded  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million that are not designated as hedge instruments 
accordingly  mark to market changes in value on the swaps are recorded within the income statement 
a one basis point move in the interest rate curves over the term of the swaps would have a pre tax impact of approximately million 
these swaps have remaining terms of and years and have early termination dates ranging from dec 
 to dec 
  respectively 
counterparty credit risk and allowance for doubtful accounts as of dec 
  our credit exposure included a million exposure to a non investment grade energy marketing company 
the remainder of our credit exposure was concentrated primarily among retail utility customers  investment grade companies  cooperative utilities and federal agencies 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and by imposing collateral requirements under certain circumstances  including the use of master netting agreements 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
the allowances provided are estimated and may be impacted by economic  market and regulatory conditions  which could have an effect on future allowance requirements and significantly impact future results of operations 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and established provisions  we can provide no assurance that our actual credit losses will be consistent with our estimates 
pension and other postretirement benefits as described in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  we have two defined benefit pension plans  three defined post retirement healthcare plans and several non qualified retirement plans 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions  the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of future increases in compensation levels  and healthcare cost projections 
the determination of our obligation and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the assumptions determined by management and used by actuaries in calculating the amounts 
although we believe our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
the pension benefit cost for for our non contributory funded pension plan is expected to be million compared to million in the estimated discount rate used to determine annual benefit cost accruals will be percent in  the discount rate used in was percent 
in selecting the discount rate  we consider cash flow durations for each plan s liabilities and returns on high credit quality fixed income yield curves for comparable durations 
we do not pre fund our non qualified pension plans 
one of the three postretirement benefit plans is partially funded 
the table below shows the expected impacts of an increase or decrease to our healthcare trend rate for our three retiree healthcare plans in thousands change in assumed trend rate impact on december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation impact on service and interest cost increase decrease contingencies when it is probable that an environmental or other legal liability has been incurred  a loss is recognized when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the probability and the amount of loss are made based on currently available facts 
accounting for contingencies requires significant judgment regarding the estimated probabilities and ranges of exposure to potential liability 
our assessment of our exposure to contingencies could change to the extent there are additional future developments  or as more information becomes available 
if actual obligations incurred are different from our estimates  the recognition of the actual amounts could have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax returns 
each tax paying entity records income taxes as if it were a separate taxpayer and consolidating adjustments are allocated to the subsidiaries based on separate company computations of taxable income or loss 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized  at currently enacted income tax rates  to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
such temporary differences are the result of provisions in the income tax law that either require or permit certain items to be reported on the income tax return in a different period than they are reported in the financial statements 
we classify deferred tax assets and liabilities into current and non current amounts based on the nature of the related assets and liabilities 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and provides any necessary valuation allowances as required 
if we determine that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretations of tax laws and the resolution of current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to changes in tax law  we do not expect that the recently enacted american taxpayer relief act of will have a material impact on the amounts provided for income taxes including our ability to realize deferred tax assets 
since the date of enactment was jan 
  the atra could not be considered when determining deferred tax liabilities and assets as of dec 
  which resulted in the reclassification of a sizable amount of federal and state deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards from non current to current 
however  certain provisions of the atra  primarily the extension of percent bonus depreciation  are currently expected to result in minimal utilization of such carryforwards in see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for additional information 
liquidity and capital resources overview bhc and its subsidiaries require cash to support and grow our business 
our predominant source of cash is supplied by our operations and supplemented with corporate borrowings 
this cash is used for  among other things  working capital  capital expenditures  dividends  pension funding  investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses  payment of debt obligations and redemption of outstanding debt and equity securities when required or financially appropriate 
the most significant items impacting cash are our capital expenditures  the purchase of natural gas for our gas utilities and our power generation segment  as well as the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
we could experience significant cash requirements during peak months of the winter heating season due to higher natural gas consumption and during periods of high natural gas prices 
we believe that our cash on hand  operating cash flows  existing borrowing capacity and ability to complete new debt and equity financings  taken in their entirety  provide sufficient capital resources to fund our ongoing operating requirements  debt maturities  anticipated dividends  and anticipated capital expenditures discussed in this section 
the following table provides an informational summary of our financial position as of dec 
dollars in thousands financial position summary cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and equivalents short term debt  including current maturities of long term debt long term debt stockholders equity ratios long term debt ratio total debt ratio the proceeds from the sale of enserco and the sale of a majority of our williston basin assets were used to pay down debt  improving our credit profile 
significant factors affecting liquidity although we believe we have sufficient resources to fund our cash requirements  there are many factors with the potential to influence our cash flow position  including seasonality  commodity prices  significant capital projects  requirements imposed by state and federal agencies  and economic market conditions 
we have implemented risk mitigation programs  where possible  to stabilize cash flow  however  the potential for unforeseen events affecting cash needs will continue to exist 
weather seasonality  commodity pricing and associated hedging strategies we manage liquidity needs through hedging activities  primarily in connection with seasonal needs of our utility operations including seasonal peaks in fuel requirements  interest rate movements  and commodity price movements 
utility factors our cash flows and in turn liquidity needs in many of our regulated jurisdictions can be subject to fluctuations in weather and commodity prices 
since weather conditions are uncontrollable  we have implemented commission approved natural gas hedging programs in many of our regulated jurisdictions to mitigate significant changes in natural gas commodity pricing 
we target hedging approximately to percent of our natural gas supply using options  futures and basis swaps 
oil and gas factors our cash flows in our oil and gas segment can be subject to fluctuations in commodity prices 
significant changes in crude oil or natural gas commodity prices can have a significant impact on liquidity needs 
since commodity prices are uncontrollable  we have implemented a hedging program to mitigate the effects of significant changes in crude oil and natural gas commodity pricing on existing production 
new production is subject to market prices until the production can be quantified and hedged 
we target to hedge approximately percent to percent of our existing natural gas and crude oil production using options  futures and basis swaps for the next two years 
see market risk disclosures for hedge details 
interest rates several of our debt instruments have a variable interest rate component which can change dramatically depending on the economic climate 
we deploy hedging strategies that include floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at dec 
  percent of our interest rate exposure has been mitigated through either fixed or hedged interest rates 
we have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million that are not designated as hedge instruments 
accordingly  mark to market changes in value on these swaps are recorded within the income statements 
we recorded a million non cash pre tax unrealized mark to market gain and million non cash pre tax unrealized mark to market loss on these swaps for the years ended dec 
 and dec 
  respectively 
the mark to market value on these swaps was a liability of million  net of cash collateral  at dec 
 subsequent mark to market adjustments could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
a one basis point move in the interest rate curve over the term of the swaps would have a pre tax impact of approximately million 
these swaps are for terms of and years and have early termination dates ranging from dec 
 to dec 
  respectively 
we anticipate extending these agreements upon their early termination dates and have continued to maintain these swaps in anticipation of our upcoming financing needs 
alternatively  we may choose to cash settle these swaps at fair value prior to the early termination dates  or unless these dates are extended  we will cash settle these swaps for an amount equal to their fair value on the termination dates 
in addition  we have million notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps with a maximum remaining term of years 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges  and accordingly their mark to market adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the mark to market value of these swaps was a liability of million at dec 
 federal and state regulations federal we are structured as a utility holding company which owns several regulated utilities 
within this structure  we are subject to various regulations by our commissions that can influence our liquidity 
as an example  the issuance of debt by our regulated subsidiaries and the use of our utility assets as collateral generally require the prior approval of the state regulators in the state in which the utility assets are located 
furthermore  as a result of our holding company structure  our right as a common shareholder to receive assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon a subsidiary liquidation or reorganization is subordinate to the claims against the assets of such subsidiaries by their creditors 
therefore  our holding company debt obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future claims of the creditors of our subsidiaries  including trade creditors  debt holders  secured creditors  taxing authorities and guarantee holders 
income tax the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of  enacted into law on dec 
  included provisions allowing for the acceleration of depreciation of certain property for tax purposes 
these provisions resulted in approximately million of tax benefits for bhc as indicated in the table below 
the tax benefits contributed to the generation of a tax loss carryforward that we believe will defer payment of cash taxes until approximately in millions tax benefit the atra  enacted into law on jan 
  extended percent bonus depreciation generally to qualifying property placed in service during it is anticipated that the extension of bonus depreciation by the atra will result in approximately million of additional tax benefits to bhc 
the additional depreciation deductions will serve to reduce taxable income and extend the tax loss carryforwards as indicated above from being fully utilized in to being fully utilized in based on current projections 
the cash generated by bonus depreciation is an acceleration of tax benefits that we would have otherwise received over to years 
additionally  from a regulatory perspective  while the capital additions at the company regulated businesses generally increase future revenue requirements  the bonus depreciation associated with these capital additions will partially mitigate future rate increases related to capital additions 
see additional information in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements filed in this annual report on form k 
cash generation and cash requirments cash generation our primary sources of cash are generated from operating activities  our five year revolving credit facility expiring feb 
 and our ability to access the public and private capital markets through debt and securities offerings when necessary 
restricted cash although we have the ability to access cash when necessary  some of our subsidiaries have contractual agreements with covenants that restrict the use of cash 
as provisions under these agreements are met  cash is no longer restricted and becomes available for its intended purposes 
our restricted cash positions as of dec 
 totaled million 
cash collateral under contractual agreements and exchange requirements  bhc or its subsidiaries have collateral requirements  which if triggered  require us to post cash collateral positions with the counterparty to meet these obligations 
we have posted the following amounts of cash collateral with counterparties at dec 
in thousands purpose of cash collateral natural gas futures and basis swaps pursuant to utility commission approved hedging programs oil and gas derivatives interest rate swaps derivatives not designated as hedges total cash collateral positions cash flow activities the following table summarizes our cash flows in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities compared to operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million higher than in primarily attributable to cash earnings income from continuing operations plus non cash adjustments were million higher than prior year  net inflows from operating assets and liabilities of continuing operations of million higher than prior year 
the increase primarily related to decreased gas volumes in inventory  the decrease in accounts payable of approximately million due to the expiration of colorado electric s contract with psco at dec 
  and other normal working capital changes  a million contribution in to our defined benefit plans compared to million in  and a million increase in net cash inflows from discontinued operations in compared to investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in for a net inflow of million 
the change was driven by cash proceeds from assets sold during  including million from the sale of approximately percent of our williston basin assets by our oil and gas segment  million from the sale of a percent ownership interest in the busch ranch wind project  and million from the sale of enserco  and in  we had lower capital expenditures of million primarily due to the completion of construction of our pueblo generation facility 
financing activities cash used in financing activities was million in  which was an increase in outflow of million from primarily attributable to during  approximately million of the proceeds from the sale of enserco were used to pay down short term borrowings on the revolving credit facility 
additional borrowings on the revolving credit facility were primarily used for our working capital needs  while in we increased short term borrowings by approximately million primarily due to our continued construction in colorado  in  we repaid our million senior unsecured percent bonds with proceeds from the sale of williston basin assets and black hills power repaid its million pollution control revenue bonds  cash dividends on common stock of million were paid in compared to million paid in  and in we issued common stock for proceeds of million primarily from an equity forward transaction 
compared to operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million  million more than in in addition to normal working capital changes  our operating cash flow increase was primarily attributable to cash earnings income from continuing operations plus non cash adjustments were million higher than prior year  an million contribution in to our defined benefit plans compared to million in  increased inflows from operating assets and liabilities of continuing operations of million primarily as a result of increased cash outflows for materials  supplies and fuel primarily including purchases of natural gas at our gas utilities and purchases of additional supplies for generation built to support colorado electric customers  increased cash inflows primarily due to adjustments to our gca at our gas utilities in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities combined with inflows from energy efficiency rebates  and cash inflows from accounts receivable and other current assets primarily the result of a settlement reached with the irs 
a million increase in net cash inflows from discontinued operations in compared to investing activities cash used in investing activities was million in  which was million more than in capital additions were million in compared to million in the cash outflows for property  plant and equipment additions reflect significant additions during and for completion of construction of megawatts of natural gas fired electric generation at colorado electric and of megawatts of natural gas fired electric generation at black hills colorado ipp  new transmission at the electric utilities and oil and gas property maintenance capital and development drilling 
the outflows were partially offset by cash proceeds of million for the sale of a portion of wygen iii to the city of gillette and million for the sale of operating assets in nebraska to the city of omaha 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million in  which was an increase of million from during  we issued additional common stock for million primarily from an equity forward transaction  paid million in cash dividends on common stock  increased short term borrowings by approximately million primarily due to our continued construction in colorado and repaid million primarily for black hills wyoming project financing debt 
in  we issued million unsecured notes  increased short term borrowings by approximately million and repaid million primarily for black hills power bonds and black hills wyoming project debt 
capital expenditures capital expenditures are a substantial portion of our cash requirements each year and we continue to forecast a robust capital expenditure program during the next three years 
historically  a significant portion of our capital expenditures relate primarily to assets that may be included in utility rate base  and if considered prudent by regulators  can be recovered from our utility customers 
those capital expenditures also earn a rate of return authorized by the commissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to rate agreements 
our electric utilities capital expenditures consist of building cheyenne prairie  improvements to generating stations  transmission and distribution lines 
capital expenditures associated with our gas utilities are primarily to improve the existing gas distribution network 
in addition to our utility capital expenditures  we allocate a portion of our capital budget to non regulated operations with specific focus on our oil and gas drilling program 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowing on our existing revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund ongoing capital expenditures  including approximately million to build cheyenne prairie 
we would ultimately expect to finance this new generation with long term bonds 
historical capital requirements our primary capital requirements for the three years ended dec 
were as follows in thousands property additions a utilities electric utilities b gas utilities non regulated energy power generation c coal mining oil and gas d corporate capital expenditures for continuing operations discontinued operations investing activities total expenditures for property  plant and equipment common stock dividends maturities redemptions of long term debt discontinued operations financing activities a includes accruals for property  plant and equipment 
b includes million in for orders placed relating to cheyenne prairie which will commence construction in the spring of and million for construction of our percent ownership in the busch ranch wind project  million and million in and  respectively for construction of the megawatt natural gas fired generation facility at colorado electric  excluding transmission  million  million and million in new transmission projects in  and  respectively  and million for wygen iii construction in during  we received reimbursement of million from the joint owners of the wygen iii facility 
we retained ownership of percent of the wygen iii coal fired plant that went into service in c includes million and million in and  respectively  for construction of the megawatt natural gas fired power generation facility at black hills colorado ipp 
d approximately million and of the capital expenditures in and  respectively  were for our drilling program in the bakken shale formation 
a majority of those assets were sold sept 
 forecasted capital requirements our primary capital requirements for the three years ended dec 
are expected to be as follows in thousands utilities electric utilities gas utilities non regulated energy power generation coal mining oil and gas corporate capital expenditures for our electric utilities include expenditures associated with building cheyenne prairie of million and million in and  respectively 
we continue to evaluate potential future acquisitions and other growth opportunities which are dependent upon the availability of economic opportunities and  as a result  capital expenditures may vary significantly from the estimates identified above 
debt operating activities our principal sources to meet day to day operating cash requirements are cash from operations and our corporate revolving credit facility 
revolving credit facility we have a million revolving corporate credit facility which matures on feb 
 that has an accordion feature which allows us  with the consent of the administrative agent and issuing agents  to increase the capacity of the facility to million 
borrowings are available under a base rate or various eurodollar rate options 
the interest costs associated with the letters of credit or borrowings under the agreement are determined based upon our credit ratings 
at our current credit rating of bbb  the margins for base rate borrowings  eurodollar borrowings and letters of credit are percent  percent and percent  respectively 
a commitment fee is charged on the unused amount of the revolving credit facility which is percent based on current credit ratings 
our revolving credit facility at dec

 revolving credit facility february  the revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  such as limitations on the creation of new indebtedness and on certain liens  restrictions on certain transactions  and maintaining a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed to 
subject to applicable cure periods  a violation of any of these covenants would constitute an event of default that entitles the lenders to terminate their remaining commitments and accelerate all principal and interest outstanding 
under the revolving credit facility  our recourse leverage ratio is the ratio of our recourse debt  letters of credit and guarantees issued over our total capital which includes the balance in the numerator plus our net worth 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of dec 
 the revolving credit facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends if a default or an event of default exists prior to  or would result after paying a dividend 
although these contractual restrictions exist  we do not anticipate triggering any default measures or restrictions 
utility money pool as a utility holding company  we are required to establish a cash management program to address lending and borrowing activities between our utility subsidiaries and the company 
we have established utility money pool agreements which address these requirements 
these agreements are on file with the ferc and appropriate state regulators 
under the utility money pool agreements  our utilities may at their option  borrow and extend short term loans to our other utilities via a utility money pool at market based rates percent at dec 
 
while the utility money pool may borrow funds from the company as ultimate parent company  the money pool arrangement does not allow loans from our utility subsidiaries to the company as ultimate parent company or to non regulated affiliates 
at dec 
 money pool balances included in thousands borrowings from loans to money pool outstanding subsidiary black hills utility holdings black hills power cheyenne light total money pool borrowings from parent capital resources our principal sources for our long term capital needs have been issuances of long term debt securities by the company and its subsidiaries along with proceeds obtained from public and private offerings of equity 
black hills power pollution control bonds in may  black hills power s percent pollution control revenue bonds were paid in full for million principal and interest 
corporate term loans in june  we extended a one year million unsecured  single draw  term loan the term loan with cobank  the bank of nova scotia and us bank to mature on june  the cost of borrowing under the term loan is based on a spread of percent  over libor percent at dec 
 
the covenants are substantially the same as those included in the revolving credit facility with an additional minimum net worth requirement 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of dec 
 we have a million two year term loan the loan with j 
p morgan and union bank that matures on sept 
 the cost of the borrowings under the loan is based on a spread of percent over libor percent at dec 
 
borrowings under the loan may be prepaid without penalty 
the proceeds were used to reduce borrowings on the revolving credit facility 
the covenants are substantially the same as under the revolving credit facility 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  million senior unsecured bonds on oct   we redeemed our million senior unsecured percent notes  which were originally scheduled to mature on may  the total payment was million  including accrued interest and a make whole provision payment of million pre tax 
million senior unsecured bonds on may   our percent  million of senior unsecured bonds mature 
future financing plans during the next three years  bhc plans to consider completing the following financing activities to take advantage of the low interest rate environment extend the million and million term loans  analyze the early refinancing of our million  percent senior unsecured bonds that mature in may  and or review long term financing options for the estimated million cheyenne prairie capital project 
cross default provisions our revolving credit facility and two corporate term loans contain cross default provisions that would result in a default if bhc or its subsidiaries failed to make timely payments of debt obligations or triggered other default provisions under any debt agreement totaling in the aggregate principal amount of million or more that permits the acceleration of debt maturities or mandatory debt prepayment 
the revolving credit facility prohibits us from paying cash dividends if we are in a default or if paying dividends would cause us to be in default 
equity our current three year outlook does not anticipate the need to access the equity markets unless future acquisitions are announced 
shelf registration we have an effective automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec under which we may issue  from time to time  senior debt securities  subordinated debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants and other securities 
although the shelf registration statement does not limit our issuance capacity  our ability to issue securities is limited to the authority granted by our board of directors  certain covenants in our financing arrangements and restrictions imposed by federal and state regulatory authorities 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock 
as of dec 
  we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
common stock dividends future cash dividends  if any  will be dependent on our results of operations  financial position  cash flows  reinvestment opportunities and other factors which will be evaluated and approved by our board of directors 
in january  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share or an annualized equivalent dividend rate of per share 
the table below provides our historical three year dividend payout ratio and dividends paid per share 
dividend payout ratio dividends per share our three year annualized dividend growth rate was percent  and all dividends were paid out of available operating cash flows 
dividend restrictions as a utility holding company which owns several regulated utilities  we are subject to various regulations that could influence our liquidity 
for example  the issuance of debt by our utility subsidiaries including the ability of black hills utility holdings to issue debt and the use of our utility assets as collateral generally requires the prior approval of the state regulators in the state in which the utility assets are located 
as a result of our holding company structure  our right as a common shareholder  to receive assets of any of our direct or indirect subsidiaries upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization  is junior to the claims against the assets of such subsidiaries by their creditors 
therefore  our holding company debt obligations are effectively subordinated to all existing and future claims of the creditors of our subsidiaries  including trade creditors  debt holders  secured creditors  taxing authorities  and guarantee holders 
our credit facilities and other debt obligations contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends upon a default or event of default 
an event of default would be deemed to have occurred if we did not meet certain financial covenants 
the most restrictive financial covenants of our revolving credit facility include the following a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed 
to and a minimum consolidated net worth of million plus percent of aggregate consolidated net income since january  as of dec 
  we were in compliance with these covenants 
covenants within cheyenne light financing agreements require cheyenne light to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of no more than 
to 
our utilities in colorado  iowa  kansas and nebraska have regulatory agreements in which they cannot pay dividends if they have issued debt to third parties and the payment of a dividend would reduce their equity ratio to below percent of their total capitalization  and neither black hills utility holdings nor its utility subsidiaries can extend credit to the company except in the ordinary course of business and upon reasonable terms consistent with market terms 
additionally  our utility subsidiaries may generally be limited to the amount of dividends allowed by state regulatory authorities to be paid to us as a utility holding company and also may have further restrictions under the federal power act 
as of december   the restricted net assets at our electric and gas utilities were approximately million 
as required by a covenant of the black hills wyoming project financing  black hills non regulated holdings  the parent of black hills electric generation which is the parent of black hills wyoming  has restricted shareholders equity of at least million 
in addition  black hills wyoming holds million of restricted cash associated with the project financing requirements 
credit ratings and counterparties financing for operational needs and capital expenditure requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows depends upon the cost and availability of external funds through both short and long term financing 
the inability to raise capital on favorable terms could negatively affect the company ability to maintain or expand its businesses 
access to funds is dependent upon factors such as general economic and capital market conditions  regulatory authorizations and policies  the company credit ratings  cash flows from routine operations and the credit ratings of counterparties 
after assessing the current operating performance  liquidity and credit ratings of the company  management believes that the company will have access to the capital markets at prevailing market rates for companies with comparable credit ratings 
bhc notes that credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating

we had million in letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility in place at december  market risk disclosures our activities in the regulated and non regulated energy sectors expose us to a number of risks in the normal operations of our businesses 
depending on the activity  we are exposed to varying degrees of market risk and credit risk 
to manage and mitigate these identified risks  we have adopted the black hills corporation risk policies and procedures 
market risk is the potential loss that may occur as a result of an adverse change in market price or rate 
we are exposed to the following market risks  including  but not limited to commodity price risk associated with our natural long position with crude oil and natural gas reserves and production  fuel procurement for certain of our gas fired generation assets and variability in revenue due to changes in gas usage at our regulated electric utilities and gas utilities segments resulting from commodity price changes  and interest rate risk associated with our variable rate credit facility  project financing floating rate debt and our other long term debt instruments as described in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our exposure to these market risks is affected by a number of factors including the size  duration  and composition of our energy portfolio  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates  and commodity prices  the volatility of these prices and rates  and the liquidity of the related interest rate and commodity markets 
the black hills corporation risk policies and procedures have been approved by our executive risk committee and reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
these policies relate to numerous matters including governance  control infrastructure  authorized commodities and trading instruments  prohibited activities  and employee conduct 
the executive risk committee  which includes senior level executives  meets on a regular basis to review our business and credit activities and to ensure that these activities are conducted within the authorized policies 
utilities group we produce  purchase and distribute power in four states  and purchase and distribute natural gas in five states 
all of our utilities have gca provisions that allow them to pass the prudently incurred cost of gas through to the customer 
to the extent that gas prices are higher or lower than amounts in our current billing rates  adjustments are made on a periodic basis to true up billed amounts to match the actual natural gas cost we incurred 
in south dakota  colorado  wyoming and montana  we have a mechanism for our regulated electric utilities that serves a purpose similar to the gcas for our regulated gas utilities 
to the extent that our fuel and purchased power costs are higher or lower than the energy cost built into our tariffs  the difference or a portion thereof is passed through to the customer 
these adjustments are subject to periodic prudence reviews by the state utility commissions 
our utility customers are exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices  therefore  as allowed or required by state utility commissions  we have entered into commission approved hedging programs utilizing natural gas futures  options and basis swaps to reduce our customers underlying exposure to these fluctuations 
these transactions are considered derivatives and in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedging  mark to market adjustments are recorded as derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized and realized gains and losses  as well as option premiums and commissions on these transactions are recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities in accordance with state commission guidelines 
accordingly  the hedging activity is recognized in the consolidated statements of income or the consolidated statements of comprehensive income loss when the related costs are recovered through our rates 
the fair value of our utilities group derivative contracts at dec 
is summarized below in thousands net derivative liabilities cash collateral oil and gas oil and gas exploration and production we produce natural gas and crude oil through our exploration and production activities 
our natural long positions  or unhedged open positions  introduce commodity price risk and variability in our cash flows 
we employ risk management methods to mitigate this commodity price risk and preserve cash flows  and we have adopted guidelines covering hedging for our natural gas and crude oil production 
these guidelines have been approved by our executive risk committee and the board of directors  and are routinely reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
to mitigate commodity price risk and preserve cash flows  we primarily use over the counter swaps  exchange traded futures and related options to hedge portions of our crude oil and natural gas production 
we elect hedge accounting on these instruments 
our hedging policy allows up to percent of our natural gas and crude oil production from proven producing reserves to be hedged for a period up to three years in the future 
we have entered into agreements to hedge a portion of our estimated and natural gas and crude oil production from the oil and gas segment 
the hedge agreements in place as of dec 
 are as follows natural gas for the three months ended march  june  sept

 wholesale power a potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity 
these short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands 
to control such risk  we restrict wholesale off system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities and purchased power resources exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin 
financing activities we engage in activities to manage risks associated with changes in interest rates 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our floating rate debt obligations 
at dec 
  we had million of notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps  with a maximum term of years 
these swaps have been designated as hedges in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedges and accordingly their mark to market adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets 
we also have interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million  which were entered into for the purpose of hedging interest rate movements that would impact long term financings that were originally expected to occur in based on credit market conditions that transpired during the fourth quarter of  we determined it was probable that the forecasted long term debt financings would not occur in the time period originally specified and  as a result  the swaps were no longer effective hedges and the hedge relationships were de designated 
mark to market adjustments on the swaps are now recorded within the income statements and for the years ended dec 
  and we recorded a pre tax unrealized mark to market gain loss of million  million and million  respectively 
these swaps are and year swaps which have early termination dates ranging from dec 
 to dec 
  respectively 
we have continued to maintain these swaps in anticipation of our upcoming financing needs  particularly our upcoming holding company debt maturities 
alternatively  we may choose to cash settle these swaps at their fair value prior to their early termination dates  or unless these dates are extended  we will cash settle these swaps for an amount equal to their fair value on the stated termination dates

credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from non performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty 
we have adopted the black hills corporation credit policy that establishes guidelines  controls  and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk within risk tolerances established by the board of directors 
in addition  our executive risk committee  which includes senior executives  meets on a regular basis to review our credit activities and to monitor compliance with the adopted policies 
we seek to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies  setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength  obtaining netting agreements  and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parental guarantees  prepayments  letters of credit  and other security agreements 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and provisions established  we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past  or that an investment grade counterparty will not default sometime in the future 
at dec 
  our credit exposure included a million exposure to a non investment grade energy marketing company 
the remainder of our credit exposure was concentrated primarily among investment grade companies  municipal cooperatives and federal agencies
