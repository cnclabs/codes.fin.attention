item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data in item above and our historical consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are an independent energy company focused on the exploration  exploitation  acquisition and production of crude oil and natural gas in the rocky mountain region of the united states 
our corporate strategy is to internally identify prospects  acquire lands encompassing those prospects and evaluate those prospects using subsurface geology and geophysical data and exploratory drilling 
using this strategy  we have developed an oil and natural gas portfolio of proved reserves  as well as development and exploratory drilling opportunities on high potential conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas prospects 
our oil and natural gas reserves and operations are primarily concentrated in the williston basin of north dakota and montana and  to a lesser extent  the green river basin of wyoming and colorado 
the most significant prospects in our portfolio are our assets in the williston basin  where the principal target of drilling is the bakken shale hydrocarbon system highlighted by production from the middle bakken member  located between two bakken shales that serve as the source rock  and the tfs member  positioned immediately below the lower bakken shale 
as of december   we owned an interest in approximately  gross  net acres in the williston basin and have an interest in gross net producing wells in the williston basin 
oil and gas property acquisitions the following is a summary of our acquisitions during the last two fiscal years january acquisition on january   we acquired certain oil and gas leaseholds  overriding royalty interests and producing properties located in north dakota  and various other related rights  permits  contracts  equipment and other assets  including the assignment and assumption of a drilling rig contract the january acquisition 
the effective date for this acquisition was september  the producing properties acquired in january contributed revenue to us for the years ended december  and of million and  respectively 
oil and gas proved reserves acquired were  mboe 
we closed this acquisition for aggregate consideration of approximately million 
this consideration was comprised of i  shares of the company common stock and ii cash consideration in an amount equal to approximately million 
we funded the cash balance due at closing through the release from escrow of the proceeds from our november high yield debt and equity offering 
through this acquisition  we acquired approximately  net leasehold acres and net production of approximately  barrels of oil equivalent per day located primarily in mckenzie and williams counties  nd we operate substantially all of the leasehold acquired through this acquisition 
october acquisition on october   we acquired interests in approximately  net acres of williston basin leaseholds  and related producing properties located primarily in williams county  north dakota along with various other related rights  permits  contracts  equipment and other assets 
the seller in this transaction received cash consideration of approximately million 
the effective date for the acquisition was august  the producing properties acquired in october contributed revenue to us for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 

table of contents june acquisition on june   we acquired interests in approximately  net acres of williston basin leaseholds and related producing properties located in mckenzie county  north dakota along with various other related rights  permits  contracts  equipment and other assets for a combination of cash and stock 
the seller in this transaction received  shares of the company s common stock valued at approximately million and cash consideration of approximately million 
the effective date for the acquisition was april  the producing properties acquired in june contributed revenue to us for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures and capital budget the following table sets forth our actual capital expenditures for the years ended december    and and our capital expenditures budget for capital expenditures include cash expenditures  accrued expenditures  oil and gas property acquisitions through the issuance of common stock and are net of divestitures in millions 
for the years ended december  budget actual actual actual costs incurred acquisitions proved oil and gas properties unproved oil and gas properties asset retirement obligations total acquisitions capital expenditures operated drilling and completion costs non operated drilling and completion costs total drilling and completion costs salt water disposal wells and facilities leasehold acquisitions total capital expenditures asset retirement obligations capitalized interest total capital expenditures including non cash items total capitalized costs includes acquisitions accounted for as business combinations 
the table below summarizes the wells spud and completed during the year ended december  as a result of our capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   we incurred capital expenditures of million related to drilling and completion operations exclusive of our january acquisition 
at december   we had gross net operated and gross net non operated wells waiting on completion 
spud completed gross net gross net for the year ended december  operated wells non operated wells 
table of contents industry wide  exploration and development activity in the williston basin continued at a high level in during the year  our drilling operations benefited from improved efficiencies resulting in decreased spud to rig release drilling times 
as the basin has experienced a significant increase in third party oil field services over the past year and operators gain efficiencies through more pad drilling  we have seen improved field services and reduced costs 
during the year  our completed well costs trended downward from approximately million per well  including surface facilities and pipeline connections  to approximately million by year end 
further  we recently renegotiated agreements with certain suppliers  which we expect will reduce our drilling and completion costs to approximately million per well in early our board of directors approved a million capital expenditure budget for  all of which is allocated to oil and gas activities in the williston basin of north dakota 
we have allocated million to the drilling and completion of gross net operated wells  million to non operated drilling and completion activities for net wells  and million for water disposal systems  well connections and acreage acquisitions 
we anticipate funding this capital program through existing cash on hand  our expected cash flow from operations  and borrowing capacity expected to be available under our credit facility 
as of the date of this filing  we had a borrowing base and total commitment for the credit facility of million  of which million is currently available 
the following chart illustrates our expected capital allocation by operating area 
screenhunterfebjpg 
we are currently operating seven drilling rigs and anticipate operating six to seven drilling rigs for the majority of our rig termination schedule allows us to adjust capital expenditures in reaction to economic conditions such as a decline in crude oil prices 
we are proceeding with a pilot program to test wells within a drilling spacing unit in each of our polar and smokey operating areas 
in each project  six wells will target the middle bakken and six wells will target intervals within the three forks formation 
the polar pilot project wells are being drilled from three four well pads 
geologic and geophysical work on the dsu will include cores and high resolution logs to evaluate the middle bakken and all benches of the tfs 
in addition  a micro seismic program is planned to further evaluate completion procedure effectiveness 
in our smokey block  two wells within the test dsu are now producing  and three additional well bores have recently been drilled into the same dsu 
we expect to drill the remaining seven wells following drilling of the polar pilot program 
water disposal and oil and gas lines are being constructed in each of the test areas and should be operational before completion activities begin 
results from these pilot projects will be evaluated throughout 
table of contents our capital expenditure budget is subject to various factors  including market conditions  oilfield services and equipment availability  commodity prices and drilling results 
while we continue to explore opportunities to expand our acreage position  our current budget is primarily allocated to drilling and completing wells 
if we choose to pursue the acquisition of significant additional leaseholds  we would need to increase our budget accordingly 
other factors that could cause us to further adjust our capital expenditure budget include  among other things  increases or decreases in service and material costs  the formation of joint ventures with other exploration and production companies  the divestiture of non strategic assets  changes in commodity prices or well performance that differ from our forecasts  any of which could affect our operating cash flow 
liquidity and capital resources our drilling program is designed to provide flexibility in identifying suitable well locations and in the timing and size of capital investment 
we plan to finance our capital expenditure budget of million and our obligations under our senior notes and other contractual commitments through existing cash on hand  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity expected to be available under our credit facility  as discussed in more detail below sources of capital cash flow from operations 
we expect our cash flow from operations to continue to increase commensurate with our anticipated increase in sales volumes 
we have been able to increase our volumes on a quarter over quarter basis for the past three years 
this increase is directly related to our successful operations as we have developed our properties 
if we are able to continue to drill and complete our wells as anticipated and they produce at rates similar to those generated by our existing wells  subject to the changes in the market price of crude oil  we would expect our production rates and operating cash flows to continue to increase as we continue to develop our properties 
credit facility 
as of december   our maximum credit available under the credit facility is million with a current borrowing base and aggregate commitments of million 
as of december   we had available borrowings under the credit facility of million 
all proceeds from the issuance of the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes defined below in january were used to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
as of the date of this filing  we have million available under this credit facility 
the ability to maintain and increase this facility and borrow additional funds is dependent on a number of variables  including our proved reserves  and assumptions regarding the price at which oil and natural gas can be sold 
further  we expect that our borrowing base will increase with the addition of proved properties resulting from our ongoing drilling and completion activities 
we are subject to restrictive covenants under the credit facility 
for further details on our credit facility and senior notes please refer to note long term debt under item in this annual report 
capital requirements outlook we are dependent on our anticipated cash flows from operations and the expected borrowing availability under our credit facility to fund our capital expenditures budget  our obligations under our senior notes and other contractual commitments please refer to note long term debt and note commitments and contingencies under item in this annual report for further details 
while we expect such sources of capital to be sufficient for such purposes  there can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated future cash flows from operations  that credit will be available under our credit facility when needed  or that we would be able to complete alternative transactions in the capital markets  if needed 
our ability to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms is dependent on a number of factors  many of which we cannot control  including changes in our credit rating  interest rates  market perceptions of us and the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry and tax burdens due to new tax laws 

table of contents if our existing and potential sources of liquidity are not sufficient to satisfy such commitments and to undertake our currently planned expenditures  we believe that we have the flexibility in our commitments to alter our drilling program 
since we operate the majority of our acreage  we have the ability to adjust our drilling schedule to reflect a change in commodity price or oil field service environment 
the majority of our acreage is currently producing and the remaining acreage could be held by production within the primary term of the lease  even with a reduced number of drilling rigs 
if we were not successful in obtaining sufficient funding or completing an alternative transaction on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  we would be required to curtail our planned expenditures or restructure our operations including reducing our rig count and sub contracting our pressure pumping services agreement  either of which may in certain circumstances result in termination fees depending on the timing and requirements of the underlying agreements  we would be unable to implement our original exploration and drilling program  and we may be unable to service our debt obligation or satisfy our contractual obligations 
senior notes senior notes due in november  we issued in a private placement at par million principal amount of senior notes due december  which notes were subsequently exchanged for sec registered notes pursuant to the exchange offer defined below the original notes 
the net proceeds from such issuance were primarily used to finance our january acquisition and to repay in full our second lien credit agreement  which was then terminated 
in may  we issued in a private placement an additional million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due december  at of par  resulting in a million premium on the issuance which notes were subsequently exchanged for sec registered notes pursuant to the exchange offer the follow on notes  and together with the original notes  the notes 
the net proceeds from such issuance were used to repay all borrowings on our credit facility and to fund our capital expenditure program and general corporate purposes 
the interest on our notes is payable on june and december of each year 
on july   the company filed a registration statement on form s no 
 amended on october  and declared effective by the sec on october  with the sec in accordance with registration rights agreements associated with the privately placed notes 
on october   the company commenced a registered exchange offer exchange offer pursuant to which all of the holders of the privately placed notes exchanged their notes for sec registered notes 
the exchange offer closed on november  senior notes due in january  we issued at par million principal amount of senior notes due january  the notes  and together with the notes  the senior notes 
all of the net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay borrowings on our credit facility 
the interest on our notes is payable on january and july of each year 
in connection with the sale of our notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement to allow the holders to exchange the notes for sec registered notes and to file  under certain circumstances  a shelf registration statement to cover resales of the notes 
if we fail to complete the registered exchange offer or the shelf registration statement has not been declared effective within specified time periods  we will be required to pay liquidated damages by way of additional interest on the notes 
for further discussion regarding our senior notes  please refer to note long term debt under item in this annual report 
working capital as part of our cash management strategy  we frequently use available funds to reduce any balance on our credit facility 
because of this  we generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances 
since our principal source of operating cash flows proved reserves to be produced in future years is not considered working capital  we often have low or negative working capital 
our working capital was a deficit of million at december   as compared to a positive million at december  
table of contents registered offerings historically  we have financed our operations  property acquisitions and other capital investments from the proceeds of offerings of our equity and debt securities 
we currently have on file with the sec a universal shelf registration statement to allow us to offer an indeterminate amount of securities in the future 
under the registration statement  we may offer from time to time debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants and other securities or any combination of such securities in amounts  prices and on terms announced when and if the securities are offered 
the specifics of any future offerings  along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered  will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement at the time of any such offering 
derivative instruments we utilize various derivative instruments in connection with anticipated crude oil sales to minimize the impact of product price fluctuations and ensure cash flow for future capital needs 
currently  we utilize swaps and no premium collars 
current period settlements on commodity derivative instruments impact our liquidity  since we are either paying cash to  or receiving cash from  our counterparties 
if actual commodity prices are higher than the fixed or ceiling prices in our derivative instruments  our cash flows will be lower than if we had no derivative instruments 
conversely  if actual commodity prices are lower than the fixed or floor prices in our derivative instruments  our cash flows will be higher than if we had no derivative instruments 
cash flow analysis the following is a summary of our change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december   and in thousands for the years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities 
the key components of our net cash provided by operating activities are our sales volumes in particular  our crude oil sales volumes and commodity prices in particular  crude oil prices 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   our net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  primarily from increased crude oil sales volumes attributable to our successful drilling and completions in our core middle bakken and tfs formations in the williston basin 
additionally  we utilize derivative instruments  as further discussed in the operating results section below  to partially mitigate the impact of decreases in crude oil prices 
net cash used in investing activities 
the primary driver in our net cash used for investing activities is our capital expenditure budget  which consists of both our ongoing drilling and completion expenditures and our acquisition expenditures 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   our net cash used in investing activities increased by million 
this increase is primarily attributed to our january acquisition  which required million in cash  and secondarily  to our significantly increased capital expenditures for drilling and completions during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   our net cash provided by financing activities increased by million 
this was a result of our receipt from escrow of million related to the issuance of our original notes in november million of which was used to fund our january acquisition and million of which was used to repay our second lien credit agreement and the receipt of million in net proceeds from the issuance of our follow on notes in may 
table of contents operating results the bakken is the only field as such term is used within the meaning of applicable regulations of the sec that contains more than of our total proved reserves 
at december   this field contained of our total proved reserves 
our revenues are directly affected by oil and natural gas commodity prices  which can fluctuate dramatically 
the commodity prices are largely beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
we have seen significant volatility in oil and natural gas prices in recent years 
the following table discloses our oil and gas sales volumes from the bakken field and from our other fields combined and in total  for the periods indicated for the years ended december  sales volume bakken oil mbbls gas mmcf sales volume other oil mbbls gas mmcf sales volume total oil mbbls gas mmcf sales volumes mboe does not include production of natural gas that was flared  all of which is related to the bakken field 
for the years ended december   and  we flared gas in the amounts of  mmcf  mmcf and mmcf  respectively 
sales prices received  and costs incurred  presented on a per boe basis  for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following table for the years ended december  sales price oil bbls gas mcf boe boe commodity price risk management activities sales boe realized gain loss production costs sales boe lease operating expenses production and property taxes gathering  transportation  marketing dda g a stock based compensation average gas price received at the wellhead includes proceeds from natural gas liquids under percentage of proceeds contracts 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil sales revenues 
oil sales revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to oil sales of million for the year ended december  in  our crude oil sales averaged  barrels per day 
our oil sales volume increased to  thousand barrels mbbls in as compared to  mbbls in the volume increase is due to the development of our bakken properties as well as our october property acquisition and january acquisition 
of the  mbbls increase in oil sales volume  mbbls is related to the increase in production from producing wells acquired in these acquisitions and  mbbls is attributed to our ongoing development of our legacy properties and undeveloped acreage 
the increase in crude oil revenues in is attributed to a million positive impact due to increased sales volumes 
however  the average price we realized on the sale of our oil decreased from per barrel for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  resulting in a negative impact of million in oil sales revenues 
overall  of the increase in oil sales revenue was attributed to increased volumes and negative was attributed to the decrease in crude oil prices received 
natural gas sales revenues 
natural gas revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to natural gas revenues of for the year ended december  natural gas sales volumes increased by  million cubic feet mmcf to  mmcf for the year ended december  in  our natural gas sales averaged mmcf per day 
the average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas was per mcf in compared to per mcf in the decrease in natural gas prices realized resulted in a million decrease in natural gas revenues and the increase in natural gas sales volumes resulted in a million increase in natural gas revenues 
overall  of the increase in natural gas sales revenue was attributed to increased sales volumes and negative was attributed to the decrease in natural gas prices received 
the volume increase is due to the development of our bakken properties as well as our october property acquisition and january acquisition 
of the  mmcf increase in natural gas sales volume  mmcf is related to the increase in production from producing wells acquired in these acquisitions and  mmcf is attributed to our ongoing development of our legacy properties and undeveloped acreage 
although gas from certain wells continues to be flared  during and throughout  we connected the majority of our wells to gas pipelines which allowed us to capture the related sales revenue 
as these third parties expand their processing capacity  we expect additional gas volumes to be gathered  processed and sold 
oil and gas production expense 
our oil and gas production expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase is due to a million increase in production taxes  a million increase in lease operating expenses loe  and an million increase in gathering  transportation and marketing expenses 
the production tax increase is attributable to increased revenue as it is calculated as a fixed percentage of sales revenue 
loe increased year over year due to a higher number of wells that we operate or participate in 
on a per unit basis  loe decreased from per barrel sold in to per barrel sold in the largest component of our lease operating expense continues to be the disposal of produced water 
to date  the majority of water has been transported by truck to third party disposal facilities 
availability of both trucking and third party disposal facilities has improved  which has decreased our loe on a per unit basis 
to further reduce water disposal costs  in  we drilled water disposal wells on several of our producing areas and are constructing water gathering systems where appropriate 
as we connect existing and future wells to these water gathering systems  we expect our loe related to water disposal to continue to decrease on a per unit basis 
depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion dd a expense 
our depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion expense increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to more volumes being sold in as sales increased by approximately  mboe 
on a per unit basis  dd a increased from per boe in to per boe in this increase in the dd a rate was primarily the result of the allocation of the purchase price to proved properties related to our acquisitions in october and our january acquisition 
acquired proved reserves are valued at fair market value on the date of acquisition  which contributes to a higher amortization base  as compared to our historical cost of acquiring leasehold and developing our properties 
to date  the fair value of our acquired proved reserves has been higher than our historical cost of developing our properties even though the resulting eurs are equivalent 
in addition our undeveloped properties acquired in our october property acquisition and our january acquisition carry higher costs than our legacy properties as they were valued at fair market value on the date of acquisition 
as a portion of these undeveloped properties were proved  their related costs were transferred to the amortization base  which also increased the dd a rate per boe 
therefore  the increase in the ratio of costs subject to 
table of contents amortization to the reserves acquired is greater than our internally developed properties 
we believe that  although initially these acquisitions increase our dd a rate per boe over the development of the acquired properties  the resulting rates will decline with infill drilling and the addition of the related reserves 
general and administrative g a expense 
g a expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the growth in personnel and related costs as we have expanded our operational activities 
total employees have increased to at year end from at year end for the year ended december   we had an average of employees as compared to in  an increase of 
on a per unit basis  g a decreased from per barrel sold in to per barrel sold in the decrease is primarily due to our increase in sales volumes from our ongoing bakken development program 
our g a expense includes the non cash expense for stock based compensation for stock options and share grants under our stock incentive plan 
for the years ended december   this expense was million as compared to million in operating income 
our operating income was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase in operating income is attributed to our on going successful completions of wells and resulting increase in sales volumes in our bakken play 
gain loss on commodity price risk management activities 
primarily due to the decrease in nymex crude oil prices at december  as compared to december   we incurred a total gain on our price risk management activities of million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  this gain is a result of our hedging program used to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
this gain was comprised of approximately million of realized gains for transactions that were settled during and million of unrealized gains for the mark to market of forward transactions 
the unrealized gain is a non cash adjustment for the value of our risk management transactions at december  these transactions will continue to change in value until the transactions are settled and we will likely add to our hedging program 
therefore  we expect our net income to reflect the volatility of commodity price forward markets 
our cash flows will only be affected upon settlement of the transactions at the current market prices at that time 
interest income expense  net 
for the year ended december   we recognized interest expense of approximately million  as compared to million for the year ended december  we incurred interest expense for the years ended december  and of approximately million and million  respectively  related to the credit facilities and our notes 
included in interest expense for the year ended december  and was the amortization of deferred financing costs and bond premium of million and million  respectively 
additionally  in the first quarter of  we recognized a million prepayment penalty for the early termination of the second lien credit agreement 
for the year ended december  and  we capitalized interest costs of million and  respectively 
income tax expense 
as discussed in note income taxes under item in this annual report  through march   we had a full valuation allowance against our us and canada net deferred tax assets 
during the second quarter of  we concluded that it was appropriate to reverse the us valuation allowance  but retained a full valuation allowance on our canadian net deferred tax assets 
we recognized a net deferred tax liability and income tax expense of million as of december  and for the year then ended  respectively 
for the year ended december   there was no income tax expense or benefit recognized as we had a full valuation allowance on our us and canadian net deferred tax assets 
net income 
our net income was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our net income for the year ended december  was positively impacted by our gain on commodity price risk management activities and increases in revenue 
however  net income was negatively impacted by increased dd a  g a  interest expense  and income tax expense 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil sales revenues 
oil sales revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to oil sales of million for the year ended december  in  our crude oil sales averaged  barrels per day 
our oil sales volume increased to  thousand barrels in as compared to mbbls in the volume increase is due to our ongoing bakken development program 
these increases are primarily due to bringing net wells on to production in in addition to commodity price increases 
the increased revenue from oil sales in is attributed to a million positive impact due to increased volumes 
additionally  the average price we realized on the sale of our oil increased from per barrel for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  resulting in a positive impact of million in revenue 
overall  of the increase is oil sales revenue was attributed to increased volumes and was attributed to the increase in crude oil prices received 
natural gas sales revenues 
natural gas revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to natural gas revenues of  for the year ended december  natural gas sales volumes increased by  mcf to  mcf for the year ended december  in  our natural gas sales averaged  mcf per day 
the average price we realized on the sale of our natural gas was per mcf in compared to per mcf in the increase in natural gas prices realized resulted in a  increase in natural gas revenues and the increase in natural gas volumes resulted in a million increase in natural gas revenues 
overall  of the increase in natural gas sales revenue was attributed to increased volumes and was attributed to the increase in natural gas prices received 
the increase in our natural gas sales volumes is largely a result of production and sales of associated gas from our bakken properties offset by a decline of our wyoming assets that historically contributed a majority of our natural gas production 
the price realized from sales of our natural gas increased due to the growth of our gas sales from our bakken properties  which has a higher natural gas liquids content compared to our wyoming properties 
although the majority of our gas from the bakken wells to date has been flared  late in  we began connecting our wells to third party pipelines that gather and transport the gas to processing plants and sales pipelines 
during  we connected the majority of our wells to gas pipelines which allowed us to capture the related sales revenue 
oil and gas production expense 
our oil and gas production expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the increase is due to a million increase in production taxes  a million increase in lease operating expenses loe  and a million increase in gathering  transportation and marketing expenses 
the production tax increase is attributable to increased revenue as it is calculated as a fixed percentage of sales revenue 
loe increased year over year due to a higher number of wells that we operate or participate in 
on a per unit basis  loe increased from per barrel sold in to per barrel sold in as a result of the increase in the number of wells completed during compared to  we incurred more expense in water disposal costs 
the largest cost driver in our williston basin operations is the disposal of water used in the well completion operations 
we expense the water handling costs once oil production is established 
to date  the majority of water has been transported by truck to third party disposal facilities 
in the fourth quarter  we also incurred an expense of approximately  or per barrel sold to relocate a third party pipeline 
additionally  throughout  we incurred additional costs to repair roads from the severe weather conditions that resulted in flooding during the spring of depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion dd a expense 
our depletion  depreciation  amortization and abandonment liability accretion expense increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase is due to increased volumes sold in as sales increased by approximately  boe 
on a per unit basis  dd a increased from per boe in to per boe in this increase is primarily due to the acquisition of proved reserves related to our and acquisitions 
acquired proved reserves are valued at fair market value on the date of acquisition  which contributes to a higher amortization base  as compared to our historical cost of acquiring leasehold and developing our properties 
to date  the fair value of our acquired proved reserves has been higher than our historical cost of developing our properties even though the resulting eur s are equivalent 
therefore  the increase in the ratio of costs subject to amortization to the reserves acquired is greater than our internally developed properties 

table of contents additionally  well costs increased in as we began predominantly completing our wells using a greater number of fracture stimulation stages and increased volumes of proppant 
these factors increased the well completion costs  but we believe that the higher upfront costs will generate overall higher returns through greater production volumes and total oil and gas reserves 
because of the early stages of development of our bakken play  our reserves  especially for undeveloped locations  included increased well costs  but not the improved reserves 
general and administrative g a expense 
g a expense increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase was due to growth in personnel and related costs as we expanded our operational activities 
total employees increased to at year end from at year end additionally  in  we incurred approximately  in transaction costs related to the acquisitions that closed in and early  as compared to transaction costs of approximately  in for the acquisition that closed in on a per unit basis  g a decreased from per barrel sold in to per barrel sold in the decrease is primarily due to our increase in sales volumes from our ongoing bakken development program 
our g a expense includes the non cash expense for stock based compensation for stock options and share grants under our stock incentive plan 
for the year ended december   this expense was million as compared to million in operating income 
our operating income was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the same period in this increase in operating income was attributable to our on going successful completions of wells and the resulting increase in sales volumes in our bakken play as well as crude oil price improvement for the year ended as compared to loss on commodity price risk management activities 
for the year ended december   we incurred a total loss on our risk management activities of million 
this loss is a result of our hedging program used to mitigate our exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
this loss was comprised of approximately million of realized losses for transactions that were settled during and million of unrealized losses for the mark to market of forward transactions 
the unrealized loss is a non cash adjustment for the value of our risk management transactions at december  these transactions will continue to change in value until the transactions are settled and we will likely add to our hedging program 
therefore  we expect our net income to reflect the volatility of commodity price forward markets 
our cash flows will only be affected upon settlement of the transactions at the current market prices at that time 
interest income expense  net 
for the year ended december   we recognized interest expense of approximately million  as compared to  for the same period in included in interest expense in was approximately million of financing costs related to a stand by bridge financing that we obtained to enable the closing of january acquisition in the event that we were unable to fund the acquisition with proceeds from the issuance of the original notes in november as the bridge financing was not utilized  all financing costs of approximately million were expensed in the fourth quarter of also during  as a result of the extinguishment of the second lien credit agreement in january  we accelerated amortization of the related capitalized deferred financing costs  which resulted in additional amortization expense of approximately million 
we recognized interest expense during of approximately million related to the credit facilities and the issuance of the original notes in november additionally  we capitalized interest costs of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income 
our net income was approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of million for although our revenue  net of production expenses  was higher compared to  our net income was negatively impacted by increased dd a  g a  interest expense and  most significantly  the loss on price risk management activities discussed above

the above contractual obligations schedule does not include future anticipated settlement of derivative contracts or estimated amounts expected to be incurred in the future associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties  as we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of such payments 
as is customary in the oil and gas industry  the company may at times have commitments in place to reserve or earn certain acreage positions or wells 
if the company does not meet such commitments  the acreage positions or wells may be lost 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires our management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect our financial disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies  please refer to note basis of presentation and significant accounting policies under item of this annual report 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect our financial disclosures 
oil and natural gas reserves estimates estimating accumulations of gas and oil is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
we believe estimated reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows are the most important estimates made by an exploration and production company such as ours because they affect the perceived value of our company  are used in comparative financial analysis ratios  and are used as the basis for the most significant accounting estimates in our financial statements  including the quarterly calculation of depletion  depreciation and impairment of our proved oil and natural gas properties 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas  that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
we determine anticipated future cash inflows and future production and development costs by applying benchmark prices and costs  including transportation  quality and basis differentials  in effect at the end of each quarter to the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas remaining to be produced as of the end of that quarter 
we reduce expected cash flows to present value using a discount rate that depends upon the purpose for which the reserve estimates will be used 
for example  the standardized measure calculation required by asc topic  extractive activities oil and gas  requires us to apply a discount rate 
although reserve estimates are inherently imprecise  and estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than those of established proved 
table of contents producing oil and natural gas properties  we make considerable effort to estimate our reserves  including through the use of independent reserves engineering consultants 
we expect that quarterly reserve estimates will change in the future as additional information becomes available or as oil and natural gas prices and operating and capital costs change 
we evaluate and estimate our oil and natural gas reserves as of december of each year and quarterly throughout the year 
for purposes of depletion  depreciation  and impairment  we adjust reserve quantities at all quarterly periods for the estimated impact of acquisitions and dispositions 
changes in depletion  depreciation or impairment calculations caused by changes in reserve quantities or net cash flows are recorded in the period in which the reserves or net cash flow estimate changes 
oil and natural gas properties  depletion and full cost ceiling test we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and exploitation and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include costs associated with lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and natural gas wells  and salaries  benefits and other internal salary related costs directly attributable to these activities 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are generally accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
depletion of the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  including estimated future development costs  is provided for using the equivalent unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves on a quarterly basis 
the capitalized costs are amortized over the life of the reserves associated with the assets  with the amortization being expensed as depletion in the period that the reserves are produced 
this depletion expense is calculated by dividing the period s production volumes by the estimated volume of reserves associated with the investment and multiplying the calculated percentage by the sum of the capitalized investment and estimated future development costs associated with the investment 
changes in our reserve estimates will therefore result in changes in our depletion expense per unit 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
unproved property costs not subject to amortization consist primarily of leasehold and seismic costs related to unproved areas 
costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
we will continue to evaluate these properties and costs will be transferred into the amortization base as undeveloped areas are tested 
unproved oil and natural gas properties are not amortized but are assessed  at least annually  for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis to determine whether we are still actively pursuing the project and whether the project has been proven  either to have economic quantities of reserves or that economic quantities of reserves do not exist 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves plus the cost of unproved properties not subject to amortization without regard to estimates of fair value  or estimated fair value  if lower  of unproved properties that are subject to amortization 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  impairment would be recognized 
derivative instruments the company has entered into commodity derivative instruments  primarily utilizing swaps or no premium collars to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil production 
the company s commodity derivative instruments are measured at fair value and are included in the accompanying balance sheets as commodity price risk management assets and liabilities 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded based on the changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments 
both the unrealized and realized gains and losses resulting from the contract settlement of derivatives are recorded in the commodity price risk management activities line on the consolidated statement of income 
we value our derivative instruments by obtaining independent market quotes  as well as using industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  risk free interest rates  and estimated volatility factors  as well as other relevant economic measures 
the discount rate used in the fair values of these instruments includes a measure of nonperformance risk by the counterparty or us  as appropriate 
we utilize the counterparties valuations to assess the reasonableness of our valuations 
the consideration of the factors results in an estimated exit price for each derivative asset or liability under a market place participant s view 
management believes that this approach provides a reasonable  non biased  verifiable  and consistent methodology for valuing commodity derivative instruments 
for additional discussion  please refer to note commodity derivative instruments under item of this annual report 

table of contents business combinations we have accounted for all of our business combinations to date using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under fasb asc topic  business combinations  and involves the use of significant judgment 
the company adopted the updated guidance of asc effective january  and applied it to our november acquisition  june acquisition  october acquisition and our january acquisition 
for a detailed summary of our acquisitions accounted for under asc  please refer to note acquisitions under item of this annual report 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is recognized immediately to earnings as a gain from bargain purchase 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities  and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
each of the business combinations completed during the last three years consisted of oil and gas properties 
the consideration we have paid to acquire these properties was entirely allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of acquisition 
consequently  there was no goodwill nor any bargain purchase gains recognized on any of our business combinations 
asset retirement obligations we are required to recognize an estimated liability for future costs associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties including without limitation the costs of reclamation of our drilling sites  storage and transmission facilities and access roads 
we base our estimate of the liability on the industry experience of our management and on our current understanding of federal and state regulatory requirements 
our present value calculations require us to estimate the economic lives of our properties  assume what future inflation rates apply to external estimates and determine the credit adjusted risk free rate to use 
in periods subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation aro  we must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a over the life of the oil and gas property 
income tax expense income taxes reflect the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when assets are recovered or settled 
deferred income taxes are also recognized for tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred income taxes are measured by applying current tax rates to the differences between financial statement and income tax reporting 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon whether future book income is sufficient to reverse existing temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets  as well as whether future taxable income is sufficient to utilize net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
assessing the need for  or the sufficiency of  a valuation allowance requires the evaluation of all available evidence  both negative and positive 
for additional discussion  please refer to note income taxes under item of this annual report 

table of contents revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and of the forward looking statements contained in our analysis of liquidity and capital resources 
we derive our revenue primarily from the sale of crude oil and natural gas 
we report revenue as the gross amounts we receive before taking into account production taxes and transportation costs  which are reported as separate expenses 
we record revenue in the month our production is delivered to the purchaser  but payment is generally received to days after the date of production 
at the end of each month  we make estimates of the amount of production that we delivered to the purchaser and the price we will receive 
we record the variances between our estimates and the actual amounts we receive in the month payment is received 
stock based compensation we have a stock based compensation plan that includes restricted stock shares  restricted stock units rsus  performance awards  stock awards  and stock options issued to employees  officers and directors as more fully described in note share based payments under item of this annual report 
we record expense associated with the fair value of stock based compensation in accordance with asc  stock based compensation 
we record compensation expense associated with the issuance of restricted stock shares and performance based rsus based on the estimated fair value of these awards determined at the time of grant 
the company recognizes compensation cost for performance based grants on a tranche level basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
each quarter  the company evaluates the actual performance results compared to the performance metrics and estimates the probability of the metrics being satisfied 
the company adjusts the number of shares expected to be granted and related expense based on its assessment 
pv the pre tax present value of future net cash flows  or pv  is a non gaap measure because it excludes income tax effects 
management believes that pre tax cash flow amounts are useful for evaluative purposes since future income taxes  which are affected by a company s unique tax position and strategies  can make after tax amounts less comparable 
we derive pv based on the present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves  net of estimated production and future development costs and future plugging and abandonment costs  using the twelve month arithmetic average of the first of the month prices without giving effect to hedging activities or future escalation  costs as of the date of estimate without future escalation  non property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses  debt service and depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment and income taxes  and discounted using an annual discount rate of 
the following table reconciles the standardized measure of future net cash flows to pv as of the dates shown in millions for the years ended december  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows add present value of future income tax discounted at pv recently issued accounting pronouncements for further information on the effects of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and the potential effects of new accounting pronouncements  refer to the section titled recent accounting pronouncements under note basis of presentation and significant accounting policies under item of this annual report 
effects of pricing and inflation the demand for oil field products and services has increased in the williston basin beginning in and continued throughout and typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  so do the associated costs 
as oil and natural gas prices decline  we would expect associated costs to decline  however  there may be a lag or the changes may be disproportionate to the lower prices 
material changes in prices also impact the current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans  depletion expense  impairment assessments of oil and gas properties  and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and gas companies and their ability to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
while we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase  higher prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials  services and personnel 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this section provides information about derivative financial instruments we use to manage commodity price volatility 
due to the historical volatility of crude oil prices  we have implemented a hedging strategy aimed at reducing the variability of the prices we receive for our production and providing a minimum revenue stream 
currently  we enter into derivative transactions such as collars and fixed price swaps in order to hedge our exposure to changes in commodity prices 
all contracts are settled with cash and do not require the delivery of a physical quantity to satisfy settlement 
while this hedging strategy may result in us having lower revenues than we would have if we were unhedged in times of higher oil prices  management believes that the stabilization of prices and protection afforded us by providing a revenue floor on a portion of our production is beneficial 
we may  from time to time  opportunistically restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to effectively modify the terms of current contracts in order to improve the pricing parameters in existing contracts or realize the current value of our existing positions 
we may use the proceeds from such transactions to secure additional contracts for periods in which we believe there is additional unmitigated commodity price risk or for other corporate purposes 
this section also provides information about our interest rate risk below 
commodity price risk our primary market risk is market changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the market prices for oil and natural gas have been highly volatile and are likely to continue to be highly volatile in the future  which will impact our prospective revenues from the sale of products or properties 
currently  we utilize swaps and no premium collars to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of our future oil production 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
all hedges are accounted for using mark to market accounting 
we use costless collars to establish floor and ceiling prices on our anticipated future oil production 
we neither receive nor pay net premiums when we enter into these arrangements 
these contracts are settled monthly 
when the settlement price the market price for oil or natural gas on the settlement date for a period is above the ceiling price  we pay our counterparty 
when the settlement price for a period is below the floor price  our counterparty is required to pay us 
we use swaps to fix the sales price for our anticipated future oil production 
upon settlement  we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay our counterparty a floating market price  as defined in each instrument 
these instruments are settled monthly 
when the floating price exceeds the fixed price for a contract month  we pay our counterparty 
when the fixed price exceeds the floating price  our counterparty is required to make a payment to us 
the use of derivatives involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial terms of such contracts 
our wholly owned subsidiary  kodiak oil gas usa inc  is currently a party to derivative contracts with six counterparties  and the company is a guarantor of kodiak oil gas usa inc the company has netting arrangements with the counterparties that provide for the offset of payables against receivables from separate derivative arrangements with the counterparties in the event of contract termination 
although the instruments are valued using indices published by established exchanges  the instruments are traded directly with the counterparties 
the derivative contracts may be terminated by a non defaulting party in the event of default by one of the parties to the agreement 
the objective of the company s use of derivative financial instruments is to achieve more predictable cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage its exposure to commodity price risk 
while the use of these derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  these instruments may also limit the company s ability to benefit from favorable price movements 
the company may  from time to time  add incremental derivatives to hedge additional production  restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to modify the terms of current contracts in order to realize the current value of the company s existing positions

the company also performs an internal valuation to ensure the reasonableness of third party quotes 
in consideration of counterparty credit risk  the company assessed the possibility of whether the counterparty to the derivative would default by failing to make any contractually required payments 
additionally  the company considers that it is of substantial credit quality and has the financial resources and willingness to meet its potential repayment obligations associated with the derivative transactions

interest rate risk at december   we had million outstanding under our notes due december   all of which has fixed interest rate of in addition  as of december   we had i million available to us under our credit facility  of which  million was drawn at year end 
the credit facility bears interest at variable rates 
assuming we had the maximum amount outstanding at december  under our credit facility of million  a increase in interest rates would result in additional annualized interest expense of million
