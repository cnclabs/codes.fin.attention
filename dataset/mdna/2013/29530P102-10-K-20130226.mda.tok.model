table of contents competition property and casualty insurers generally compete on the basis of customer service  price  consumer recognition  coverages offered  claims handling  financial stability and geographic coverage 
vigorous competition  particularly in the personal lines automobile and homeowners lines of business  is provided by large  well capitalized national companies  some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents  by smaller regional insurers  and by large companies who market and sell personal lines products directly to consumers 
in addition  because the insurance products of the property and casualty group are marketed exclusively through independent insurance agents  the property and casualty group faces competition within its appointed agencies based upon ease of doing business  product  price and service relationships 
market competition bears directly on the price charged for insurance products and services subject to regulatory limitations 
growth is driven by a company s ability to provide insurance services and competitive prices while maintaining target profit margins 
industry capital levels can also significantly affect prices charged for coverage 
growth is a product of a company s ability to retain existing customers and to attract new customers  as well as movement in the average premium per policy 
the erie insurance group has a strategic focus that we believe will result in long term underwriting performance 
first  we employ an underwriting philosophy and product mix targeted to produce a property and casualty group underwriting profit on a long term basis through careful risk selection and rational pricing 
the careful selection of risk allows for lower claims frequency and loss severity  thereby enabling insurance to be offered at favorable prices 
the property and casualty group has continued to refine its risk measurement and price sophistication models used in the underwriting and pricing processes 
second  the property and casualty group focuses on consistently providing superior service to policyholders and agents 
third  the property and casualty group s business model is designed to provide the advantages of localized marketing and claims servicing with the economies of scale and low cost of operations from centralized accounting  administrative  underwriting  investment  information management and other support services 
finally  we carefully select the independent agencies that represent the property and casualty group 
the property and casualty group seeks to be the lead insurer with its agents in order to enhance the agency relationship and the likelihood of receiving the most desirable underwriting opportunities from its agents 
we have ongoing  direct communications with our agency force 
agents have access to a number of venues we sponsor designed to promote the sharing of ideas  concerns and suggestions with the senior management of the property and casualty group  with the goal of improving communications and service 
we continually evaluate new ways to support our agents efforts  from marketing programs to identifying potential customer leads  to grow the business of the property and casualty group and sustain our long term agency relationships 
high agency penetration and long term relationships allow for greater efficiency in providing agency support and training 
efl  our life insurer  is subject to many of the same structural advantages and environmental challenges as the property and casualty group 
term life business accounts for the majority of policies issued by efl  and this product line is extremely competitive and increasingly transparent due in part to the proliferation of on line quoting services 
besides price  ease of application and processing improvements represent areas where companies are finding ways to differentiate themselves among independent producers 
efl continues to progress in these areas using state of the art technology and third party vendors 
historically  sound underwriting and disciplined approaches to pricing and investing have contributed to favorable operating results 
while efl will be challenged to maintain these trends in the face of intensified competition going forward  we continually shape our strategy and core processes to respond more effectively to the needs of our policyholders and independent agents 
employees we employed approximately  full time people at december  
table of contents reserves for property and casualty losses and loss expenses loss reserves are established to account for the estimated ultimate costs of losses and loss expenses for claims that have been reported but not yet settled and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
while we exercise professional diligence to establish reserves at the end of each period that are fully reflective of the ultimate value of all claims incurred  these reserves are  by their nature  only estimates and cannot be established with absolute certainty 
the factors which may potentially cause the greatest variation between current reserve estimates and the actual future paid amounts include unforeseen changes in statutory or case law altering the amounts to be paid on existing claim obligations  new medical procedures and or drugs with costs significantly different from those seen in the past  inflation and claims patterns on current business that differ significantly from historical claims patterns 
a discussion of our property and casualty loss reserve methodology can be found in and is referenced to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates contained within this report

government regulation property and casualty insurers are subject to supervision and regulation in the states in which they transact business 
the extent of such regulation varies  but generally derives from state statutes that delegate regulatory  supervisory and administrative authority to state insurance departments 
accordingly  the authority of the state insurance departments includes the establishment of standards of solvency that must be met and maintained by insurers  the licensing to do business of insurers and agents  the nature of the limitations on investments  the approval of premium rates for property and casualty insurance  the provisions that insurers must make for current losses and future liabilities  the deposit of securities for the benefit of policyholders  the approval of policy forms  notice requirements for the cancellation of policies and the approval of certain changes in control 
in addition  many states have enacted variations of competitive rate making laws that allow insurers to set certain premium rates for certain classes of insurance without having to obtain the prior approval by the state insurance department 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require the filing of quarterly and annual reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies 
the property and casualty group is also required to participate in various involuntary insurance programs for automobile insurance  as well as other property and casualty lines  in states in which these companies operate 
these involuntary programs provide various insurance coverages to individuals or other entities that are otherwise unable to purchase such coverages in the voluntary market 
these programs include joint underwriting associations  assigned risk plans  fair access to insurance requirements fair plans  reinsurance facilities and windstorm plans 

table of contents legislation establishing these programs generally provides for participation in proportion to voluntary writings of related lines of business in that state 
the loss ratio on insurance written under involuntary programs has traditionally been greater than the loss ratio on insurance in the voluntary market 
although currently the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry  federal programs  such as federal terrorism backstop legislation and the federal insurance office established under the dodd frank act can also impact the insurance industry 
our life insurer  efl  is subject to similar state regulations as the property and casualty group  although specific laws and statutes applicable to life insurance and annuity carriers govern its activities 
valuation laws require statutory reserves to be held at conservative levels  which can have a substantial impact on the amount of free surplus that is available for financing new business and other growth opportunities 
most states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as the erie insurance group 
each insurance company in the holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory authority of its state of domicile and furnish information regarding the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
pursuant to these laws  the respective insurance departments may examine indemnity  as the management company  the property and casualty group and efl at any time  and may require disclosure and or prior approval of certain transactions with the insurers and indemnity  as an insurance holding company 
all transactions within a holding company system affecting the member insurers of the holding company system must be fair and reasonable 
approval by the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the control of an insurer 
in some states  the acquisition of or more of the outstanding common stock of an insurer or its holding company is presumed to be a change in control 
the sale of indemnity s wholly owned property and casualty insurance subsidiaries  eic  eny and epc  and the sale of indemnity s ownership interest in efl have both been approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies 
approval by the applicable insurance commissioner is also required in order to declare extraordinary dividends
