item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data in item and the financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview of results during  we achieved the following financial and operating results increased total production by compared to  increased total estimated proved reserves to million boe as of december   an increase of compared to year end  participated in the completion of gross net wells  with a success rate in the bakken and three forks plays  continued to high grade and grow our leasehold position to  net acres with approximately of our total acreage position either developed  held by production  held by operations or permitted as of december   and ended the year with million in cash and  including availability under our revolving credit facility  liquidity of approximately million 
operationally  our performance reflects another year of successfully executing our strategy of developing our acreage position and building a long life reserve base 
our success enabled us to increase proved reserves by million boe  which is approximately times our production 
during  production increased to million boe as compared to production of million boe 
the increase in production was driven by an increase in producing net wells from net wells at december  to net wells at december  total revenues increased in compared to this increase was due to higher production and a million non cash gain from mark to market of derivative instruments 
average realized prices on a boe basis including all realized derivative settlements were higher in compared to as discussed elsewhere in this report  significant changes in oil and natural gas prices can have a material impact on our results of operations and our balance sheet  including the fair value of our derivatives 
source of our revenues we derive our revenues from the sale of oil  natural gas and ngls produced from our properties 
revenues are a function of the volume produced  the prevailing market price at the time of sale  oil quality  btu content and transportation costs to market 
we use derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a substantial  but varying  portion of our oil production 
we expect our derivative activities will help us achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations 
the use of derivative instruments has in the past  and may in the future  prevent us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements but also mitigates the effects of declining price movements 
our average realized price calculations include the effects of the settlement of all derivative contracts regardless of the accounting treatment 
principal components of our cost structure oil price differentials 
the price differential between our williston basin well head price and the nymex wti benchmark price is driven by the additional cost to transport oil from the williston basin via train  barge  pipeline or truck to refineries 
unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments 
we utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil 
this account activity represents the recognition of gains and losses associated with our outstanding derivative contracts as commodity prices and commodity derivative contracts change on contracts that have not been designated for hedge accounting 
realized gain loss on derivative instruments 
this account activity represents our realized gains and losses on the settlement of commodity derivative instruments 
production expenses 
production expenses are daily costs incurred to bring oil and natural gas out of the ground and to the market  together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties 
such costs also include field personnel compensation  salt water disposal  utilities  maintenance  repairs and servicing expenses related to our oil and natural gas properties 
production taxes 
production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from products sold at market prices not hedged prices or at fixed rates established by federal  state or local taxing authorities 
we seek to take full advantage of all credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions 
in general  the production taxes we pay correlate to the changes in oil and natural gas revenues 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire  explore and develop oil and natural gas properties 
as a full cost company  we capitalize all costs associated with our development and acquisition efforts and allocate these costs to each unit of production using the units of production method 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of maintaining our headquarters  costs of managing our acquisition and development operations  franchise taxes  audit and other professional fees and legal compliance 
interest expense 
we finance a portion of our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and acquisitions with borrowings 
as a result  we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions 
we capitalize a portion of the interest paid on applicable borrowings into our full cost pool 
we include interest expense that is not capitalized into the full cost pool  the amortization of deferred financing costs including origination and amendment fees  commitment fees and annual agency fees as interest expense 
income tax expense 
our provision for taxes includes both federal and state taxes 
we record our federal income taxes in accordance with accounting for income taxes under gaap which results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized 
selected factors that affect our operating results our revenues  cash flows from operations and future growth depend substantially upon the timing and success of drilling and production activities by our operating partners  the prices and demand for oil  natural gas and ngls  the quantity of oil and natural gas production from the wells in which we participate  changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments we use to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil  our ability to continue to identify and acquire high quality acreage  and the level of our operating expenses 
in addition to the factors that affect companies in our industry generally  the location of our acreage and wells in the williston basin subjects our operating results to factors specific to this region 
these factors include the potential adverse impact of weather on drilling  production and transportation activities  particularly during the winter months  and the limitations of the developing infrastructure and transportation capacity in this region 
the price of oil in the williston basin can vary depending on the market in which it is sold and the means of transportation used to transport the oil to market 
light sweet crude from the williston basin has a higher value at many major refining centers because of its higher quality relative to heavier and sour grades of oil  however  because of north dakota s location relative to traditional oil transport centers  this higher value is generally offset to some extent by higher transportation costs 
while rail transportation has historically been more expensive than pipeline transportation  williston basin prices have been high enough to justify shipment by rail to markets as far as st 
james  louisiana  which offers prices benchmarked to brent lls 
although pipeline  truck and rail capacity in the williston basin has historically lagged production in growth  we believe that additional planned infrastructure growth will help keep price discounts from significantly eroding wellhead values in the region 
the price at which our oil production is sold typically reflects a discount to the nymex wti benchmark price 
thus  our operating results are also affected by changes in the oil price differentials between the nymex wti and the sales prices we receive for our oil production 
higher oil price differentials lowered our oil and gas sales during the first nine months of relatively mild weather in north dakota allowed production throughout the winter increasing supply while some refineries were down for routine maintenance decreasing demand 
this caused oil price differentials to increase for a short period during the first half of  which have subsequently declined due to various rail projects coming online  refineries completing their seasonal maintenance and the reversal of the seaway pipeline from cushing  oklahoma to the gulf coast 
as the rail capacity continues to increase and planned seaway pipeline expansions are completed  we believe the oil price differentials will return to historical levels 
our oil price differential to the nymex wti benchmark price during was per barrel  as compared to per barrel in another significant factor affecting our operating results is drilling costs 
the cost of drilling wells has increased significantly over the past few years as rising oil prices have triggered increased drilling activity in the williston basin 
although individual components of the cost can vary depending on numerous factors such as the length of the horizontal lateral  the number of fracture stimulation stages  and the choice of proppant sand or ceramic  the total cost of drilling and completing an oil well has increased 
this increase is largely due to longer horizontal laterals and more fracture stimulation stages  but also higher demand for rigs and completion services throughout the region 
in addition  because of the rapid growth in drilling  the availability of well completion services has at times been constrained  resulting at times in a backlog of wells awaiting completion 
market conditions prices for various quantities of oil  natural gas  and ngls that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows 
commodity prices have been volatile in recent years 
the following tables list average nymex prices for oil and natural gas for the years ended december   and year ended december  average nymex prices oil per bbl natural gas per mcf based on average of daily closing prices 
results of operations for  and the following table sets forth selected financial and operating data for the periods indicated 
production volumes and average sales prices are derived from accrued accounting data for the relevant period indicated

realized prices include realized gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivatives 
oil  natural gas and ngl sales  production and realized price calculations our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes 
in  oil  natural gas and ngl sales increased from  driven primarily by a increase in production and partially aided by a increase in realized prices taking into account the effect of settled derivatives 
in  oil and natural gas sales increased from due to a increase in production and partially aided by a increase in realized pricing taking into account the effect of settled derivatives

derivative instruments we enter into derivative instruments to manage the price risk attributable to future oil production 
for  we incurred a loss on settled derivatives of million  compared to million in and million in our average realized price including all derivative settlements received during was per boe compared to per boe in and per boe in our average realized price including all derivative settlements calculation includes all cash settlements for derivatives 
mark to market derivative gains and losses were gains of million in compared to a million gain in and a million loss in our derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting and are accounted for using the mark to market accounting method whereby gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognized immediately into earnings 
mark to market accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from derivatives are included in total revenues and are not included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheets 
as commodity prices increase or decrease  such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark to market value of our derivatives 
any gains on our derivatives will be offset by lower wellhead revenues in the future or any losses will be offset by higher future wellhead revenues based on the value at the settlement date 
at december   all of our derivative contracts are recorded at their fair value  which was a net asset of million  an increase of million from the million net liability recorded as of december  our open oil derivative contracts are summarized in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
production expenses production expenses were million in compared to million in and million in we experience increases in operating expenses as we add new wells and maintain production from existing properties 
on an absolute dollar basis  our spending for production expenses for was higher when compared to due to production levels increasing  as well as higher water hauling and disposal costs and higher servicing expenses 
production expenses are generally higher during a well s first year of operations due to higher levels of servicing activities associated with managing production levels during a well s steepest period of decline 
since of our net wells have produced for less than twelve months  we believe the high level of servicing activities will decline as our property base matures 
on an absolute dollar basis  our spending for production expenses for was higher when compared to due to production levels increasing and higher water hauling and disposal costs and servicing expenses 
on a per unit basis  production expenses per boe increased from per barrel sold in to in on a per unit basis  production expenses per boe increased from per barrel sold in to in production taxes we pay production taxes based on realized oil and natural gas sales 
these costs were million in compared to million in and million in our average production tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the average production tax rate was higher than the average due to well additions that qualified for reduced rates or tax exemptions during certain portions of our production occurs in montana and north dakota jurisdictions that have lower initial tax rates for an established period of time or until an established threshold of production is exceeded  after which the tax rates are increased to the standard tax rate 
the average production tax rate was lower than the average due to the well additions that qualified for reduced rates for tax exemptions during the majority of our production is located in north dakota which imposes a standard tax on our production revenues except for where properties qualify for reduced rates 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for and million in the increase of million when compared to is due to higher base salaries  cash bonuses and benefits million  increased share based compensation expense million  increased travel expenses million and partially offset by lower office and other administrative expenses million 
additionally  general and administrative expenses include million of severance charges in connection with the departures of our former president and former chief operating officer 
our personnel costs continue to increase as we invest in our technical teams and other staffing to support our growth 
share based compensation expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants granted to our employees and directors as part of compensation as well as fully vested share grants to employees and directors throughout the year 
the increase of million when compared to is due to higher base salaries and benefits million  increased share based compensation expense million  higher legal and professional expenses million  increased travel expenses million and higher office and other administrative expenses due to the addition of more employees million 
depletion  depreciation and amortization depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a was million in compared to million in and million in depletion expense  the largest component of dd a  was per boe in compared to per boe in and per boe in we have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on the year end reserve report and other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs 
the aggregate increase in depletion expense for compared to was driven by a increase in production 
additionally  depletion rates rose in due to an increase in our future development cost estimates to reflect the changes in well completion methodologies eg more stimulation costs per well due to longer lateral extensions and increased production expenses 
depletion rates in new plays tend to be higher in the beginning as increased initial outlays are amortized over proved reserves based on early stages of evaluations 
as these plays mature  new technologies  well completion methodologies and additional historical operating information impact the reserve evaluations 
the increase in depletion expense for compared to was driven by a increase in production

the increase in interest expense for as compared to was primarily due to different weighted average debt amounts outstanding between years  as well as the higher interest rate applicable to the senior notes 
interest income interest income was  for compared to million in interest income for decreased million as compared to because of lower levels of cash and short term investments 
in  the higher amount of cash and short term investments resulted from the sale of common stock in november interest income was million for compared to million in interest income for increased million as compared to due to higher levels of cash and short term investments that resulted from the sale of common stock

non gaap financial measures we define adjusted net income as net income excluding i unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments  net of tax and ii severance expenses in connection with the departures of our former president and former chief operating officer  net of tax 
our adjusted net income for the year ended december   was million representing approximately per diluted share  as compared to million representing approximately per diluted share for the year ended december   and million representing approximately per diluted share for the year ended december  these increases in adjusted net income are primarily due to our continued addition of oil and natural gas production from new wells and higher realized commodity prices in compared to and in compared to we define adjusted ebitda as net income before i interest expense  ii income taxes  iii depreciation  depletion  amortization  and accretion  iv unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments and v non cash share based compensation expense 
adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  was million  compared to adjusted ebitda of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  these increases in adjusted ebitda are primarily due to our continued addition of oil and natural gas production from new wells and higher realized commodity prices in compared to and in compared to we believe the use of these non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors to gain an overall understanding of our current financial performance 
specifically  we believe the non gaap financial measures included herein provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and unrealized commodity gains and losses that our management believes are not indicative of our core operating results 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures are used by management for budgeting and forecasting as well as subsequently measuring our performance  and we believe that we are providing investors with financial measures that most closely align to our internal measurement processes 
we consider these non gaap measures to be useful in evaluating our core operating results as they more closely reflect our essential revenue generating activities and direct operating expenses resulting in cash expenditures needed to perform these revenue generating activities 
our management also believes  based on feedback provided by the investment community  that the non gaap financial measures are necessary to allow the investment community to construct its valuation models to better compare our results with our competitors and market sector 
these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles 
we believe that non gaap financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap financial measures 
adjusted net income and adjusted ebitda are non gaap measures

our budget anticipates we will participate in the drilling and completion of approximately net wells targeting the bakken and three forks formations 
drilling capital expenditures on a per well basis are expected to have an average completed cost of million to million per well  which assumes a decrease in drilling costs for compared to based on evolving conditions in the field  we expect to spend approximately million on acreage capital expenditures during in addition  we estimate that we will spend approximately million on other capital expenditure activities  primarily capitalized workover expenses 
we have the ability to adjust capital expenditures by reducing the number of projects we elect to participate in 
we currently expect to fund all commitments using a combination of cash on hand  cash flow generated by operations  bank borrowings and potential debt financings 
liquidity and capital resources overview historically  our main sources of liquidity and capital resources have been internally generated cash flow from operations  credit facility borrowings and issuances of equity 
we generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use cash from operations to fund our development activities or reduce our bank debt 
we continue to take steps to ensure adequate capital resources and liquidity to fund our capital expenditure program 
in february  we amended and restated the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility to increase the maximum facility size to million  subject to a borrowing base that is currently million 
in may  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes the notes due june  the issuance of these notes resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million  which are in use to fund our exploration  development and acquisition program and for general corporate purposes including repayment of borrowings that were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at the time the notes were issued 
with our revolving credit facility and our anticipated cash reserves and cash from operations  we believe that we will have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund our budgeted capital expenditures and operating expenses for at least the next twelve months 
any significant acquisition of additional properties or significant increase in drilling activity may require us to seek additional capital 
we may also choose to seek additional financing from the capital markets rather than utilize our revolving credit facility to fund such activities 
we cannot assure you  however  that any additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
at december   our debt to total capitalization ratio was  we had million of total debt outstanding  million of stockholders equity  and million of cash on hand 
additionally  at december   there was million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million of debt outstanding  million of stockholders equity  and million of cash on hand 
cash flows cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices  net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives 
our cash flows from operations also are impacted by changes in working capital 
we generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to fund our development activities or reduce our bank debt 
short term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we generally use derivatives to economically hedge a significant  but varying portion of our anticipated future oil production for the next to months 
any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts are funded by proceeds received from the sale of our production 
production receipts  however  lag payments to the counterparties 
any interim cash needs are funded by cash from operations or borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had entered into derivative agreements covering million barrels for and million barrels for  with average floor prices of and  respectively

revolving credit facility in february  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility  which replaced our previous revolving credit facility 
the new facility  secured by substantially all of our assets  provides for an initial commitment equal to the lesser of the facility amount or the borrowing base 
at december   the maximum facility amount was million and the borrowing base was million

capital requirements our primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and payment of interest on outstanding indebtedness 
during  our acquisition and development expenditures included approximately million of drilling  completion and capitalized workover costs  million of capitalized internal costs and million of capitalized interest 
also in  approximately million was expended on acreage acquisitions and other acreage related costs located in the williston basin 
our capital program was funded by cash on hand  net cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the notes 
our capital expenditure budget for is discussed above under the heading operation plan 
development and acquisition activities are highly discretionary  and  for the near term  we expect such activities to be maintained at levels we can fund through internal cash flow and borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  debt may be issued to fund these requirements 
we monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis  adjusting the amount up or down and also between our projects  depending on commodity prices  cash flow and projected returns 
also  our obligations may change due to acquisitions  divestitures and continued growth 
our future success in growing proved reserves and production may be dependent on our ability to access outside sources of capital 
if internally generated cash flow and borrowing capacity is not available under our revolving credit facility  we may issue additional shares of stock  subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  extend maturities or to repay debt 
satisfaction of our cash obligations for the next months with our revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operations  we believe we have sufficient capital to meet our drilling commitments and expected general and administrative expenses for the next twelve months 
nonetheless  any strategic acquisition of assets or increase in drilling activity may require us to seek additional capital 
we may also choose to seek additional capital rather than utilize our credit facility or other debt instruments to fund accelerated or continued drilling at the discretion of management and depending on prevailing market conditions 
we will evaluate any potential opportunities for acquisitions as they arise 
however  there can be no assurance that any additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
over the next months it is possible that our existing capital  our revolving credit facility and anticipated funds from operations may not be sufficient to sustain continued acreage acquisitions and drilling activities 
consequently  we may seek additional capital in the future to fund growth and expansion through additional debt or equity financing or credit facilities 
no assurance can be made that such financing would be available  and if available it may take either the form of debt or equity 
in either case  the financing could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our shareholders 
effects of inflation and pricing the oil and natural gas industry is very cyclical and the demand for goods and services of oil field companies  suppliers and others associated with the industry put extreme pressure on the economic stability and pricing structure within the industry 
typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  so do all associated costs 
conversely  in a period of declining prices  associated cost declines are likely to lag and may not adjust downward in proportion 
material changes in prices also impact our current revenue stream  estimates of future reserves  borrowing base calculations of bank loans  impairment assessments of oil and natural gas properties  and values of properties in purchase and sale transactions 
material changes in prices can impact the value of oil and natural gas companies and their ability to raise capital  borrow money and retain personnel 
while we do not currently expect business costs to materially increase  higher prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials  services and personnel 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments at december  to make future payments under certain contracts  aggregated by category of contractual obligation  for specified time periods payment due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total office lease automobile leases long term debt cash interest expense on debt total office lease through automobile leases for certain executives through revolving credit facility and senior notes due see note to financial statements cash interest on revolving credit facility and senior notes due are estimated assuming no principal repayment until the due date critical accounting policies the establishment and consistent application of accounting policies is a vital component of accurately and fairly presenting our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  as well as ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing financial reporting 
while there are rarely alternative methods or rules from which to select in establishing accounting and financial reporting policies  proper application often involves significant judgment regarding a given set of facts and circumstances and a complex series of decisions 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements under gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves  future development costs  estimates relating to certain oil and natural gas revenues and expenses and fair value of derivative instruments are the most critical to our financial statements 
oil and natural gas reserves the determination of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense as well as impairments that are recognized on our oil and natural gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in the future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  production taxes and development costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as the prices of oil and natural gas and cost levels change from year to year  the economics of producing our reserves may change and therefore the estimate of proved reserves may also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
the information regarding present value of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
thus  such information includes revisions of certain reserve estimates attributable to our properties included in the prior year s estimates 
these revisions reflect additional information from subsequent activities  production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices 
any future downward revisions could adversely affect our financial condition  our borrowing ability  our future prospects and the value of our common stock 
the estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves used in the preparation of our financial statements were prepared by ryder scott company  our registered independent petroleum consultants  and were prepared in accordance with the rules promulgated by the sec 
oil and natural gas properties the method of accounting we use to account for our oil and natural gas investments determines what costs are capitalized and how these costs are ultimately matched with revenues and expensed 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting to account for our oil and natural gas investments instead of the successful efforts method because we believe it more accurately reflects the underlying economics of our programs to explore and develop oil and natural gas reserves 
the full cost method embraces the concept that dry holes and other expenditures that fail to add reserves are intrinsic to the oil and natural gas exploration business 
thus  under the full cost method  all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition  development and exploration of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
these capitalized amounts include the costs of unproved properties  internal costs directly related to acquisitions  development and exploration activities  asset retirement costs  geological and geophysical costs that are directly attributable to the properties and capitalized interest 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  they are part of a program from which we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
the full cost method differs from the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and natural gas investments 
the primary difference between these two methods is the treatment of exploratory dry hole costs 
these costs are generally expensed under the successful efforts method when it is determined that measurable reserves do not exist 
geological and geophysical costs are also expensed under the successful efforts method 
under the full cost method  both dry hole costs and geological and geophysical costs are initially capitalized and classified as unproved properties pending determination of proved reserves 
if no proved reserves are discovered  these costs are then amortized with all the costs in the full cost pool 
capitalized amounts except unproved costs are depleted using the units of production method 
the depletion expense per unit of production is the ratio of the sum of our unamortized historical costs and estimated future development costs to our proved reserve volumes 
estimation of hydrocarbon reserves relies on professional judgment and use of factors that cannot be precisely determined 
subsequent reserve estimates materially different from those reported would change the depletion expense recognized during the future reporting periods 
for the year ended december   our average depletion expense per unit of production was per boe 
a decrease in our estimated net proved reserves at december  would result in a per boe increase in our per unit depletion 
to the extent the capitalized costs in our full cost pool net of depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the sum of the present value using a discount rate and based on period end oil and natural gas prices of the estimated future net cash flows from our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the capitalized cost associated with our unproved properties  we would have a capitalized ceiling impairment 
such costs would be charged to operations as a reduction of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed  even if the low prices are temporary 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if we experience poor drilling results or estimations of our proved reserves are substantially reduced 
a capitalized ceiling impairment is a reduction in earnings that does not impact cash flows  but does impact operating income and shareholders equity 
once recognized  a capitalized ceiling impairment charge to oil and natural gas properties cannot be reversed at a later date 
the risk that we will experience a ceiling test writedown increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves 
as of december  we have not incurred a capitalized ceiling impairment charge 
however  no assurance can be given that we will not experience a capitalized ceiling impairment charge in future periods 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if estimates of proved hydrocarbon reserves are substantially reduced or estimates of future development costs increase significantly 
see item properties proved reserves  for a discussion of our reserve estimation assumptions 
revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from the sale of the oil and natural gas from our interests in producing wells  hence our revenue recognition policy for these sales is significant 
we recognize revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas when production is delivered to  and title has transferred to  the purchaser and to the extent the selling price is reasonably determinable 
we use the sales method of accounting for natural gas balancing of natural gas production and would recognize a liability if the existing proved reserves were not adequate to cover the current imbalance situation 
as of december      and  our natural gas production was in balance  meaning its cumulative portion of natural gas production taken and sold from wells in which it has an interest equaled its entitled interest in natural gas production from those wells 
in general  settlements for hydrocarbon sales occur around two months after the end of the month in which the oil  natural gas or other hydrocarbon products were produced 
we estimate and accrue for the value of these sales using information available to us at the time our financial statements are generated 
differences are reflected in the accounting period that payments are received from the operator 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative instruments from time to time to manage market risks resulting from fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas 
we may periodically enter into derivative contracts  including price swaps  caps and floors  which require payments to or receipts from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed price and a variable price for a fixed quantity of oil or natural gas without the exchange of underlying volumes 
the notional amounts of these financial instruments are based on expected production from existing wells 
we have  and may continue to use exchange traded futures contracts and option contracts to hedge the delivery price of oil at a future date 
on november   due to the volatility of price differentials in the williston basin  we de designated all derivatives that were previously classified as cash flow hedges and in addition  we have elected not to designate any subsequent derivative contracts as accounting hedges 
as such  all derivative positions are carried at their fair value on the balance sheet and are marked to market at the end of each period 
any realized gains and losses are recorded to gain loss on settled derivatives and unrealized gains or losses are recorded to gain loss on mark to market of derivative instruments on the statements of comprehensive income rather than as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss or other income expense 
see note for a description of the derivative contracts which we executed during and prior to november   at the inception of a derivative contract  we designated the derivative as a cash flow hedge 
for all derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  we formally documented the relationship between the derivative contract and the hedged items  as well as the risk management objective for entering into the derivative contract 
to be designated as a cash flow hedge transaction  the relationship between the derivative and the hedged items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the risk both at the inception of the derivative and on an ongoing basis 
we historically measured hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis and hedge accounting would be discontinued prospectively if it determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item 
gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedge derivatives that become ineffective remain unchanged until the related production is delivered 
if we determine that it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the derivative are recognized in earnings immediately 
derivatives  historically  were recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of derivatives were recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative was designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it was  depending on the type of hedge transaction 
our derivatives historically consisted primarily of cash flow hedge transactions in which we were hedging the variability of cash flows related to a forecasted transaction 
period to period changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges were reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified to earnings in the periods in which the hedged item impacts earnings 
the ineffective portion of the cash flow hedges were reflected in current period earnings as gain or loss from derivatives 
gains and losses on derivative instruments that did not qualify for hedge accounting were included in income or loss from derivatives in the period in which they occur 
the resulting cash flows from derivatives were reported as cash flows from operating activities 
new accounting pronouncements recently adopted fair value measurement in may  the fasb issued fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu no 
 which provides clarifications regarding existing fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements  and also specific new guidance for items such as measurement of instruments classified within stockholders equity 
these requirements were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we implemented the accounting and disclosure guidance effective january   and the implementation did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
for required fair value measurement disclosures  see note comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu no 
 which requires the presentation of the components of net income  the components of oci and total comprehensive income in either a single continuous financial statement of comprehensive income or in two separate  but consecutive financial statements of net income and comprehensive income 
these updates do not affect the items reported in oci or the guidance for reclassifying such items to net income 
these requirements were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we implemented the financial statement presentation guidance effective january  recently issued balance sheet offsetting in december  the fasb issued balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu no 
 which requires disclosures regarding netting arrangements in agreements underlying derivatives  certain financial instruments and related collateral amounts  and the extent to which an entity s financial statement presentation policies related to netting arrangements impact amounts recorded to the financial statements 
these disclosure requirements do not affect the presentation of amounts in the balance sheets  and are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual reporting periods 
we do not expect the implementation of this disclosure guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted for a description of the accounting standards that we adopted in  see notes to financial statements note significant accounting policies 
various accounting standards and interpretations were issued in with effective dates subsequent to december  we have evaluated the recently issued accounting pronouncements that are effective in and believe that none of them will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows when adopted 
further  we are monitoring the joint standard setting efforts of the financial accounting standards board and the international accounting standards board 
there are a large number of pending accounting standards that are being targeted for completion in and beyond  including  but not limited to  standards relating to revenue recognition  accounting for leases  fair value measurements  accounting for financial instruments  disclosure of loss contingencies and financial statement presentation 
because these pending standards have not yet been finalized  at this time we are not able to determine the potential future impact that these standards will have  if any  on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and other factors 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile  and our management believes these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
our revenue during generally would have increased or decreased along with any increases or decreases in oil or natural gas prices  but the exact impact on our income is indeterminable given the variety of expenses associated with producing and selling oil that also increase and decrease along with oil prices 
we enter into derivative contracts to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to oil price volatility 
on november   due to the volatility of price differentials in the williston basin  we de designated all derivatives that were previously classified as cash flow hedges and we have elected not to designate any subsequent derivative contracts as accounting hedges 
as such  all derivative positions are carried at their fair value on the balance sheet and are marked to market at the end of each period 
any realized gains and losses are recorded to gain loss on settled derivatives and unrealized mark to market gains or losses are recorded to unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments on the statements of comprehensive income rather than as a component of other comprehensive income loss or other income expense 
we generally use derivatives to economically hedge a significant  but varying portion of our anticipated future production over a rolling month horizon 
any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts are funded by proceeds received from the sale of our production 
production receipts  however  lag payments to the counterparties 
any interim cash needs are funded by cash from operations or borrowings under our revolving credit facility

any borrowings not designated as being based upon libor will bear interest at a rate equal to the current prime rate published by the wall street journal  plus a spread ranging from to  depending on the percentage of borrowing base that is currently advanced 
we have the option to designate either pricing mechanism

all outstanding principal is due and payable upon termination of the revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility allows us to fix the interest rate of borrowings under it for all or a portion of the principal balance for a period up to three months  however our borrowings are generally withdrawn with interest rates fixed for one month 
thereafter  to the extent we do not repay the principle  our borrowings are rolled over and the interest rate is reset based on the current libor or prime rate as applicable 
as a result  changes in interest rates can impact results of operations and cash flows 
a increase in short term interest rates on our floating rate debt at december  would cost us approximately million in additional annual interest expense
