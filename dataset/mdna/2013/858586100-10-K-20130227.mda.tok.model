overview the company produces and sells intermediate chemicals that are used in a wide variety of applications worldwide 
the overall business comprises three reportable segments surfactants surfactants  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in  are principal ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning products such as detergents for washing clothes  dishes  carpets  floors and walls  as well as shampoos  body washes  toothpastes and fabric softeners 
other applications include germicidal quaternary compounds  lubricating ingredients  emulsifiers for spreading agricultural products  plastics and composites and biodiesel 
surfactants are manufactured at six north american sites five in the us and one in canada  three european sites united kingdom  france and germany  three latin american sites mexico  brazil and colombia and two asian sites philippines and singapore 
the company also holds a percent ownership interest in a joint venture  tiorco  llc tiorco  that markets chemical solutions for increasing the production of crude oil and natural gas from existing fields enhanced oil recovery 
the joint venture is accounted for under the equity method  and its financial results are excluded from surfactant segment operating results 
profits on sales of the company s surfactants to enhanced oil recovery customers are included in surfactants segment results 
polymers polymers  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in  include two primary product lines polyols and phthalic anhydride 
polyols are used in the manufacture of rigid laminate insulation board and panels for thermal insulation in the construction industry and are also a base raw material for flexible foams and coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers collectively case products 
phthalic anhydride is used in unsaturated polyester resins  alkyd resins and plasticizers for applications in construction materials and components of automotive  boating and other consumer products 
in addition  phthalic anhydride is used internally in the production of polyols 
in the us  polymer product lines are manufactured at the company s millsdale  illinois  site 
in europe  polyols are manufactured at the company s subsidiaries in germany and poland 
in asia  polyols are produced at the company s percent owned joint venture in nanjing  china 
specialty products specialty products  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales in  include flavors  emulsifiers and solubilizers used in the food and pharmaceutical industries 
specialty products are primarily manufactured at the company s maywood  new jersey  site 
in the second quarter of  the company purchased three product lines from lipid nutrition bv lipid nutrition  a part of loders croklaan bv the acquired product lines  which are produced at the company s maywood  new jersey  plant and outside contract manufacturers  provide a portfolio of nutritional fats for the food  supplement and nutrition industries 
all three segments have growth strategies that require investment outside of north america 
the company s recent surfactant investments in brazil and singapore  polymer investments in germany and poland and specialty products investment in the netherlands lipid nutrition have resulted in planned higher costs while facilitating the company s long term growth strategies 
stock split on october   the company s board of directors declared a two for one stock split in the form of a percent stock dividend  which was distributed on december   to stockholders of record on november  all share and per share data presented in this management s discussion and analysis reflect the effects of the stock split 
deferred compensation plans the accounting for the company s deferred compensation plans can cause year over year fluctuations in company profits 
compensation expense is recorded when the values of company common stock and mutual funds held for the plans increase  and compensation income is recorded when the values of company common stock and mutual funds held for the plans decrease 
the pretax effect of all deferred compensation related activities including realized and unrealized gains and losses on the mutual fund assets held to fund the deferred compensation obligations for the years ended december   and  and the statement of income line items in which the effects of the activities were recorded are displayed in the following tables income expense in millions for the year ended december change deferred compensation administrative expense investment income other  net realized unrealized gains losses on investments other  net pretax income effect income expense in millions for the year ended december change deferred compensation administrative expense investment income other  net realized unrealized gains losses on investments other  net pretax income effect see the applicable corporate expenses section of this management s discussion and analysis for details regarding the period to period change in deferred compensation 
effects of foreign currency translation the company s foreign subsidiaries transact business and report financial results in their respective local currencies 
as a result  foreign subsidiary income statements are translated into us dollars at average foreign exchange rates appropriate for the reporting period 
because foreign exchange rates fluctuate against the us dollar over time  foreign currency translation affects year to year comparisons of financial statement items ie  because foreign exchange rates fluctuate  similar year to year local currency results for a foreign subsidiary may translate into different us dollar results 
the following tables present the effects that foreign currency translation had on the year over year changes in consolidated net sales and various income line items for compared to and compared to year ended decrease due to foreign december increase in millions decrease translation net sales gross profit operating income pretax income year ended increase due to foreign december in millions increase translation net sales gross profit operating income pretax income results of operations compared with summary net income attributable to the company for increased percent to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for below is a summary discussion of the major factors leading to the year over year changes in net sales  profits and expenses 
a detailed discussion of segment operating results for compared to follows the summary 
consolidated net sales declined million  or two percent  year over year 
lower average selling prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation accounted for million and million  respectively  of the decrease 
a two percent increase in sales volume offset the effects of lower prices and foreign currency translation by million 
decreased average raw material costs for surfactants drove the decline in average selling prices 
weaker foreign currencies against the us dollar for most countries in which the company transacts business caused the unfavorable currency translation impact 
sales volume improved for the surfactants and polymers segments  but was down for specialty products 
operating income for improved million  or nine percent  over operating income reported for gross profit increased million  or percent  due to higher unit profit margins and sales volumes 
in addition  polymers gross profit benefited from a large sale of urethane systems used to insulate an aircraft carrier 
all three segments contributed to the gross profit improvement 
the effects of foreign currency translation reduced the year over year gross profit and operating income increases by million and million  respectively 
operating expenses increased million  or percent  between years 
the following summarizes the year over year changes in the individual income statement line items that comprise the company s operating expenses administrative expenses increased million  or percent  largely due to an million increase in deferred compensation expense 
an increase in the value of company common stock  to which a large part of the company s deferred compensation obligation is tied  led to the higher year over year deferred compensation expense 
see the overview and corporate expenses sections of this management discussion and analysis for further details 
legal and environmental expenses and patent filing costs accounted for million and million  respectively  of the year over year administrative expense increase 
increased costs to protect intellectual property related to the company s global innovation and growth activities led to the higher patent filing and legal expenses 
revised estimates for remediation costs at three of the company s environmental sites contributed about million to the higher legal and environmental expenses 
in addition to the foregoing  corporate fringe benefit which includes incentive pay and salary expenses increased million and million between years 
the increase in fringe benefits was driven by higher performance based bonus and profit sharing expenses that reflected the year over year improvement in company earnings 
additional staffing to support the company s growth  promotions and normal pay raises caused the increase in salary expense 
the effects of foreign currency translation reduced the year over year expense change by million 
selling expenses increased million  or percent  between years 
approximately million of the increase was due to added expense incurred for the lipid nutrition business  which was acquired in june ie  months of expense in compared to six months of expense in 
north american fringe benefit and salary expenses increased million and million  respectively 
the increased fringe benefits included higher bonus and profit sharing expenses  and the increased salary expenses reflected additional staffing and annual pay raises 
selling expenses in latin america were million higher due mainly to increased personnel expenses resulting from higher staffing levels to support the company s growth initiatives in brazil 
total bad debt expense increased million primarily due to favorable reserve adjustments made in the effects of foreign currency translation reduced the year over year selling expense change by million 
research  development and technical service expenses increased million  or percent  year over year 
higher north american salary and fringe benefit expenses accounted for million and million of the increase  respectively 
expenses for european operations were up million between years mainly due to a million increase in costs for registering company products under europe s reach registration  evaluation  authorization and restriction of chemical substances initiative and to a million increase in salary and fringe benefit expenses 
lipid nutrition and singapore each added million of additional research and development expenses primarily personnel costs  respectively  in the current year 
the effects of foreign currency translation reduced the year over year research  development and technical service expense increase by million 
interest expense  net  increased million  or six percent  between years 
higher average borrowing levels led to the increase 
in the fourth quarter of  the company secured million of additional long term notes to take advantage of low interest rates and to support global growth initiatives 
the loss from the company s percent equity joint venture tiorco increased million year over year primarily due to higher operating expenses and lower commission and technical service income 
business for the joint venture is developing slower than anticipated  but the number of opportunities in the pipeline is encouraging 
other  net was million of income for compared to million of expense for investment activity for the company s deferred compensation and supplemental defined contribution mutual fund assets resulted in income of million for compared to expense of million for in addition  foreign exchange losses for totaled million compared to million for the effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the increase was primarily attributable to the expiration of the us research and development tax credit which was partially offset by an overall lower state effective tax rate 
on january  president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  which contained a provision extending the federal research and development tax credit and the small agri biodiesel producer tax credit retroactively from january  through december  as a result of this legislation  the company expects to record a tax benefit of approximately million in the first quarter of for amounts generated in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the statutory us federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate 
segment results in thousands surfactants polymers specialty products segment results corporate total for the year ended december  net sales operating income for the year ended december  net sales operating income surfactants surfactants net sales for declined million  or four percent  from net sales for lower average selling prices  primarily due to decreased raw material costs  and the effects of foreign currency translation accounted for million and million  respectively  of the decrease 
sales volume grew by two percent  which increased net sales by million 
all regions contributed to the sales volume improvement 
a year over year comparison of net sales by region follows for the year ended in thousands december  december  increase decrease percent change north america europe latin america asia total surfactants segment net sales for north american operations decreased three percent mainly due to a four percent drop in average selling prices  which accounted for million of the net sales decline 
a slight increase in sales volume increased net sales by million 
the decrease in average selling prices was attributable to lower raw material costs  particularly for the last half of  partially offset by a more favorable sales mix 
sales volume increased less than one percent between years as increases in sales of products used in agricultural and household and industrial cleaning applications were largely offset by decreases in sales of products used in consumer laundry and cleaning and personal care applications 
increased business with most major customers led to the improved sales volume of agricultural and household and industrial cleaning and products 
competitive pressures and lower surfactant requirements for certain customer applications accounted for the decline in sales volume for consumer laundry and personal care products 
the effects of foreign currency translation reduced year over year net sales by million 
net sales for european operations declined percent due to an eight percent decrease in average selling prices and the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of the net sales change 
sales volume improved three percent between years  which mitigated the year over year net sales decline by million 
average selling prices fell as a result of raw material cost decreases 
a weakening of the european euro and british pound sterling against the us dollar caused the unfavorable foreign currency translation effect 
stronger demand and new business for the company s laundry and cleaning products  particularly fabric softeners  accounted for the sales volume increase 
net sales for latin american operations grew six percent due to a percent increase in average selling prices and a three percent increase in sales volume  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of the year over year net sales change 
the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation reduced the net sales improvement by million 
the higher average selling prices reflected a more favorable mix of sales  notably for the brazil manufacturing plant for which the sale of higher value product was made possible by last year s addition of neutralizer capacity 
a weakening of the brazilian real and mexican peso against the us dollar led to the unfavorable currency translation effect 
net sales for asia operations declined eight percent due to a different mix of sales a greater proportion of toll sales using raw material consigned by the customer that more than offset a percent improvement in sales volume 
stronger demand from existing customers and startup sales for the singapore plant accounted for the volume increase 
surfactants operating income for improved million  or percent  over operating income for gross profit increased million  or percent  primarily due to improved margins resulting from a more favorable mix of sales and lower raw material costs 
the two percent increase in sales volume and improved production efficiencies in brazil also contributed to the profit growth 
the effects of foreign currency translation reduced the year over year increase in gross profit by million 
operating expenses increased million  or nine percent 
year over year comparisons of gross profit by region and total segment operating expenses and operating income follow in thousands for the year ended december  december  increase decrease percent change gross profit north america europe latin america asia total surfactants segment operating expenses operating income gross profit for north american operations improved percent year over year largely due to improved unit sales margins 
a more favorable sales mix and lower year over year raw material costs drove the improvement 
this was particularly evident in the final three months of as quarter over quarter gross profit increased million 
the favorable sales mix resulted from the previously noted increases in sales volumes of agricultural and household and industrial cleaning products 
although average sales prices declined between years  average raw material costs fell to a greater degree  which led to improved comparative margins 
gross profit for european operations increased percent  which was principally attributable to improved unit margins and the three percent increase in sales volume 
lower raw material costs  which outpaced declining selling prices  and reduced manufacturing expenses led to the improved margins 
manufacturing expenses were lower between years as expenses for included the effects of a planned three week shutdown for a mandatory inspection at the company s germany plant 
partially offsetting the lower expenses was the impact of foreign currency translation  which lessened the year over year increase in gross profit by million 
gross profit for latin american operations improved percent mainly as a result of lower costs  favorable sales mix and higher sales volume 
gross profit for was negatively impacted by significant expenses related to the delayed start up of the capacity expansion in brazil 
the favorable sales mix reflected a greater sales volume of neutralized products 
gross profit for asia operations declined percent due to start up and preproduction expenses related to the new plant in singapore  which offset the effect of the percent increase in sales volume 
after delay  the singapore plant produced trial quantities in the fourth quarter 
in addition to the impact of the singapore plant  prior year gross profit benefited from a million recovery of value added tax receivables in the philippines  which were previously reserved for due to recoverability uncertainty 
operating expenses for the surfactants segment increased million  or nine percent  year over year 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  which reduced the year over year change by million  operating expenses were up million 
selling expenses increased million  which was primarily attributable to higher salary expenses  due to increased staffing levels and pay increases  and related personnel costs fringe benefits  incentive pay and travel associated with the company s growth initiatives 
also contributing to the selling expense increase was bad debt expense  which was up million year over year primarily due to favorable reserve adjustments in research and development expenses increased million largely as a result of higher salary expenses and related personnel costs 
higher expenses in europe associated with the reach initiative contributed million of the increase in research and development costs 
polymers polymers net sales for increased million  or one percent  over net sales for a three percent rise in sales volume and higher average selling prices accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase 
the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation reduced the net sales increase by million 
increased costs for raw materials  particularly for north american operations  led to the higher average selling prices 
europe accounted for the sales volume growth 
a year over year comparison of net sales by region is displayed below in thousands for the year ended december  december  increase decrease percent change north america europe asia and other total polymers segment net sales for north american operations were up one percent due to a one percent increase in average selling prices  which increased year over year net sales by million 
sales volume declined less than one percent  reducing the effect of the increase in average selling prices by million 
higher phthalic anhydride raw material costs led to the increase in average selling prices 
polyol selling prices declined between years due to a lower cost for a major raw material 
sales volume for phthalic anhydride fell three percent between years primarily due to reduced demand for phthalic anhydride in plasticizer applications 
polyol sales volume grew two percent primarily as a result of greater demand for polyol used in rigid board insulation and in case applications  particularly in the fourth quarter 
given lower anticipated demand for phthalic anhydride  the company reduced its manufacturing capacity by shutting down its oldest  fully depreciated reactor 
management believes that the remaining capacity is adequate to meet projected sales demand as well as the company s internal needs for the production of polyol 
net sales for european operations increased one percent due to a percent improvement in sales volume and a less than one percent rise in average selling prices  which increased year over year net sales by million and million  respectively 
the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation reduced the net sales change by million 
the improvement in sales volume reflected new uses in metal insulation panels and adhesive polyol 
a year over year weakening of the european euro and the polish zloty against the us dollar led to the foreign currency translation effect 
net sales for asia and other operations declined seven percent between years due to a seven percent decrease in average selling prices and a one percent decrease in sales volume  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of the year over year reduction in net sales 
the effects of foreign currency translation mitigated the net sales decline by million 
the lower selling prices reflected a decline in raw material costs 
polymer operating income for increased million  or percent  over operating income for gross profit increased million  as all three regions reported improvements 
the year over year increase in gross profit reflected higher margins  a large north american urethane systems sale used to insulate an aircraft carrier and increased sales volume 
the impact of a second quarter planned maintenance shutdown at the north american site tempered the gross profit improvement 
operating expenses increased million  or percent 
below are year over year comparisons of gross profit by region and total segment operating expenses and operating income in thousands for the year ended december  december  increase percent change gross profit north america europe asia and other total polymers segment operating expenses operating income gross profit for north american operations increased percent largely due to improved polyol margins and to the large urethane systems sale  partially offset by the effects of a planned triennial maintenance shutdown taken in the second quarter of the maintenance shutdown resulted in approximately million of additional costs for outsourcing a portion of the company s second quarter requirements of phthalic anhydride 
gross profit for european operations increased percent  which was attributable to improved unit margins and higher sales volumes 
the increase in unit margins included the elimination of outsourced volumes necessitated in due to a reactor fire in germany s polyol plant 
foreign currency translation had a million negative effect on the year over year change in gross profit 
as noted in prior filings  in may of one of two reactors in the german polyol plant sustained fire damage 
the damaged equipment was repaired and placed back into service in the fourth quarter of the company has insurance policies to cover repair costs and business interruption losses 
in the fourth quarter of  the company settled its insurance claim against one of two insurers 
the settlement did not have a material effect on the company s financial results 
the claim against the second insurer has not yet been settled 
gross profit for asia and other operations increased percent primarily due to improved margins resulting from lower raw material costs 
as noted in previous filings  local government officials in nanjing  china  have informed the company that its manufacturing facility in that city will need to be relocated 
the company s intention is to build a new facility  projected to be operational in  in the nanjing chemical industrial park 
in  the company purchased land use rights for the site on which the new manufacturing plant will be constructed 
scoping and costing of the project are ongoing 
management believes that there will be a period of time for which the existing plant will be out of service while the new plant is under construction 
during that period  customers requirements will be outsourced from other company plants or from an outside chemical company  which will negatively affect profits 
in addition  as a result of the impending move  the company reduced the useful life of the current plant s assets  thereby accelerating depreciation expense 
the accelerated depreciation did not have a significant effect on profits for  and is not expected to have a material effect on earnings 
operating expenses for the polymers segment increased million  or percent  between years 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  the year over year increase was million 
selling expenses increased million  which was primarily attributable to higher salary expenses  due to increased staffing levels and pay increases  and the related personnel costs fringe benefits and incentive pay 
in addition  bad debt expense increased million between years 
the increase in bad debt expense reflected favorable provision adjustments made in research and development expenses increased million mainly due to increased salaries and related personnel costs 
specialty products net sales for increased million  or percent  over net sales for the business added when the lipid nutrition product lines were acquired in june accounted for the net sales improvement 
year over year net sales and sales volume excluding the new lipid nutrition business were down five percent and percent  respectively  primarily for the segment s legacy multi chain triglyceride product lines  due to lost customer share resulting from increased foreign competition 
gross profit increased million  or seven percent  between years  due to the addition of the lipid nutrition product lines  but operating income fell million  or eight percent 
the combination of incremental operating expenses needed to support the lipid nutrition product lines and weakness in multi chain triglyceride sales led to the operating income decline 
corporate expenses corporate expenses  which comprise operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments  increased million to million for from million for increases in deferred compensation expense  legal and environmental expenses and patent filing costs accounted for million  million and million of the increase  respectively 
fringe benefits which included incentive pay  salary expenses and travel related expenses were also up year over year million  million and million  respectively 
with respect to deferred compensation  the company recorded million of expense for compared to million of expense for increases in the value of company common stock  to which a large part the deferred compensation obligation is tied  accounted for most of the higher year over year deferred compensation expense 
for  the value of company stock increased per share from per share at december   to per share at december  for  the company s common stock price increased per share from per share at december   to per share at december  the accounting for the company s deferred compensation plans results in expense when the values of company common stock and mutual fund investment assets held for the plans increase and income when the values of company common stock and mutual funds decline 
the increases in legal and environmental expenses and patent filing costs were primarily attributable to increased costs to support the company s global innovation and growth activities 
revised estimates for remediation costs for three of the company s environmental sites contributed about million to the higher legal and environmental expenses 
the increase in fringe benefits was driven by higher bonus and profit sharing expenses that reflected the year over year improvement in company earnings 
additional staffing to support the company s growth  promotions and normal pay raises caused the increase in salary expense 
compared with summary net income attributable to the company for increased percent to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for a detailed discussion of segment operating performance follows the summary 
consolidated net sales for increased million  or percent  over net sales for higher average selling prices  a three percent improvement in sales volume and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation accounted for approximately million  million and million  respectively  of the increase 
higher year over year raw material costs were the primary drivers for the increase in average selling prices

in addition to the foregoing  expenses related to the acquired lipid nutrition product lines  increased expenses in brazil to support the growth opportunities in latin america and higher salary expense in the us contributed million  million and million  respectively  to the increase 
the effects of foreign currency translation added million to the increase 
lower deferred compensation expense reduced the year over year increase in administrative expenses by million 
see the overview and corporate expenses sections of this management discussion and analysis for details regarding deferred compensation 
research  development and technical service expenses were up million  or six percent 
an increase in us expenses million  largely due to additional staff and salary expenses  was partially offset by lower product registration expenses under europe s registration  evaluation  authorization of chemical substances reach regulation million 
increased expenses for the company s operation in poland million  which reflected a full year of expenses compared to a partial year in  also contributed to the year over year increase 
interest expense  net  was up million  or percent  between and higher average borrowing levels led to the increase 
the rise in the average debt levels was  in part  attributable to working capital requirements that were driven higher by raw material cost inflation 
in addition  in november and june  the company secured million and million of additional long term notes  respectively  to take advantage of low interest rates and support global growth initiatives 
the loss from equity joint ventures  which included results for tiorco for and the results for tiorco and spi for the first three quarters of the amount included spi results for the first half of the year plus part of the third quarter  increased million year over year 
spi s equity income in was million  which included a million gain related to revaluing the company s original percent interest in spi as part of the acquisition of controlling interest in the entity 
the tiorco joint venture is primarily a cost sharing venture with nalco company now a part of ecolab inc  as the company sells surfactants directly into the enhanced recovery market and the corresponding profit resides in the surfactants segment operating results

higher raw material costs across all polymer product lines led to the higher average selling prices 
sales volume for polyols increased percent largely due to increased demand from existing rigid insulation board customers 
sales volume for phthalic anhydride declined three percent due to weaker demand from polyester resin customers 
net sales for european operations increased percent due to a percent rise in average selling prices  a percent improvement in sales volume and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  which accounted for million  million and million  respectively  of the net sales growth 
the higher average selling prices reflected higher year over year raw material costs 
the increase in sales volume resulted from stronger demand from most major rigid insulation board customers and new demand for metal panel insulation and adhesive applications 
the company s poland subsidiary  which was acquired in the third quarter of  accounted for percent of the year over year sales volume growth

unit margins were up year over year  but higher raw material costs pushed margins lower in the fourth quarter  particularly for the phthalic anhydride product line 
a seven percent increase in manufacturing expenses  primarily due to increases in depreciation and personnel related expenses  negatively affected the year over year change in gross profit 
gross profit for european operations increased percent due to the percent improvement in sales volume and million in favorable foreign currency translation impact 
unit margins for approximated those for the impact of selling price increases was largely offset by the effects of higher raw material costs and costs to outsource polyols from the segment s north american operations as a result of fire damage to one of the company s polyol reactors in germany that occurred in the second quarter of the damaged equipment was placed back into service in the fourth quarter 
gross profit for asia and other operations increased percent due to selling price increases and to the percent growth in sales volume

european and asia operations each accounted for about half of the increase in administrative expenses 
specialty products net sales for increased million  or percent  over net sales for largely due to sales related to the new lipid nutrition product lines million and to an percent increase in sales volume for food ingredient products 
operating income was down million  or eight percent  between years primarily due to higher food ingredient raw material costs  for which competitive pressures have made it difficult to raise selling prices 
the lipid nutrition product lines positively affected the segment s year over year results  adding million of operating income 
corporate expenses corporate expenses of million for were million higher than corporate expenses reported for deferred compensation expense declined million year over year  but was offset by increases in a number of other expenses  notably a million comparative increase in legal and environmental expenses  million of higher expense resulting from derivative income reported in arising from recording certain electric contracts at fair value the company held no such contracts during and a million increase in salary expense 
the comparative increase in legal and environmental expenses reflected favorable adjustments made in as a result of the reduction of the company s clean up cost liability at two sites 
increases in other corporate expenses  such as hiring  temporary help and patent fees  contributed to offsetting the effect of deferred compensation 
with respect to deferred compensation  a smaller year to year increase in the value of company stock and declines in the values of the mutual fund assets held to fund the deferred compensation obligations led to the lower year over year deferred compensation expense

demand for crop protection chemicals is expected to remain strong in the company is positioned for further profit growth in brazil 
the singapore plant is now operational and should contribute modestly to earnings in and more significantly beyond that as production at the site is diversified 
polymers should experience continued growth from polyol used in energy saving rigid foam insulation 
recent demand growth has largely come from greater insulation levels for replacement roofing 
a recovering economy would stimulate the commercial construction market and eventually restore that demand 
the polymers segment is expected to face higher costs to operate in china in and as the government is requiring that the company s plant in china be relocated to a new industrial zone 
the company plans to supply its asian customers with product toll produced by another chemical plant in china or imported from other company production sites

the company s working capital investment is heavily influenced by the cost of crude oil and natural oils  from which many of its raw materials are derived 
fluctuations in raw material costs translate directly to inventory carrying costs and indirectly to customer selling prices and accounts receivable 
the accounts receivable cash source resulted from lower end of year sales revenue  driven by raw material deflation  despite slightly higher sales volume for the fourth quarter of versus the comparable quarter last year 
in contrast  the accounts receivable cash use was driven mostly by raw material inflation accompanied by higher sales volumes 
accounts receivable turnover did not change significantly from year to year and was not a significant cash flow factor in either year 
the inventory cash use was driven by the addition of production in singapore and higher inventory quantities at other locations to support customer service  partially offset by lower average costs 
for  the inventory cash use was driven mainly by raw material inflation along with higher quantities

during the periods covered by this form k  the company was not party to any such off balance sheet arrangements 
environmental and legal matters the company s operations are subject to extensive local  state and federal regulations 
although the company s environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with these regulations  future developments and increasingly stringent environmental regulation could require the company to make additional environmental expenditures 
the company will continue to invest in the equipment and facilities necessary to comply with existing and future regulations 
during  the company s expenditures for capital projects related to the environment were million 
these projects are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  which are typically years 
recurring costs associated with the operation and maintenance of facilities for waste treatment and disposal and managing environmental compliance in ongoing operations at the company s manufacturing locations were approximately million for  million for and million for while difficult to project  it is not anticipated that these recurring expenses will increase significantly in the future 
over the years  the company has received requests for information related to or has been named by the government as a potentially responsible party at a number of waste disposal sites where cleanup costs have been or may be incurred under cercla and similar state statutes 
in addition  damages are being claimed against the company in general liability actions for alleged personal injury or property damage in the case of some disposal and plant sites 
the company believes that it has made adequate provisions for the costs it may incur with respect to the sites 
see the critical accounting policies section that follows for a discussion of the company s environmental liabilities accounting policy 
after partial remediation payments at certain sites  the company has estimated a range of possible environmental and legal losses from million to million at december   compared to million to million at december  at december   the company s accrued liability for such losses  which represented the company s best estimate within the estimated range of possible environmental and legal losses  was million compared to million at december  because the liabilities accrued are estimates  actual amounts could differ from the amounts reported 
during  cash outlays related to legal and environmental matters approximated million compared to million expended in for certain sites  the company has responded to information requests made by federal  state or local government agencies but has received no response confirming or denying the company s stated positions 
as such  estimates of the total costs  or range of possible costs  of remediation  if any  or the company s share of such costs  if any  cannot be determined with respect to these sites 
consequently  the company is unable to predict the effect thereof on the company s financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
given the information available  management believes the company has no liability at these sites 
however  in the event of one or more adverse determinations with respect to such sites in any annual or interim period  the effect on the company s cash flows and results of operations for those periods could be material 
based upon the company s present knowledge with respect to its involvement at these sites  the possibility of other viable entities responsibilities for cleanup  and the extended period over which any costs would be incurred  the company believes that these matters  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
see item  legal proceedings  in this form k and in other filings of the company with the securities and exchange commission  which are available upon request from the company 
see also note  contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the significant environmental proceedings related to certain environmental sites

critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the company believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 
deferred compensation the company sponsors deferred compensation plans that allow management employees to defer receipt of their annual bonuses and outside directors to defer receipt of their fees until retirement  departure from the company or as elected by the participant 
the plans allow for the deferred compensation to grow or decline based on the results of investment options chosen by the participants 
the investment options include company common stock and a limited selection of mutual funds 
the company funds the obligations associated with these plans by purchasing investment assets that match the investment choices made by the plan participants 
a sufficient number of shares of treasury stock are maintained on hand to cover the equivalent number of shares that result from participants electing the company common stock investment option 
as a result  the company must periodically purchase its common shares in the open market 
upon retirement or departure from the company  participants receive cash amounts equivalent to the payment date value of the investment choices they have made or company common stock shares equal to the number of share equivalents held in the accounts 
some plan distributions may be made in cash or company common stock at the option of the participant 
other plan distributions can only be made in company common stock 
for deferred compensation obligations that may be settled in cash  the company must record appreciation in the market value of the investment choices made by participants as additional compensation expense 
conversely  declines in the value of company stock or the mutual funds results in a reduction of compensation expense since such declines reduce the cash obligation of the company as of the date of the financial statements 
these market price movements may result in significant period to period fluctuations in the company s income 
because the obligations that must be settled only in company common stock are treated as equity instruments  fluctuations in the market price of the underlying company stock do not affect earnings 
at december   the company s deferred compensation liability was million  of which approximately percent represented deferred compensation tied to the performance of the company s common stock  the remainder was tied to the mutual fund investment choices 
a increase in the market price of the company s common stock will result in approximately million of additional compensation expense 
a reduction in the market price of the common stock will reduce compensation expense by a like amount 
the expense or income associated with the mutual fund component will generally fluctuate in line with the overall percentage increase or decrease of the us stock markets 
the mutual fund assets related to the deferred compensation plans are recorded on the company s balance sheet at cost when acquired and adjusted to their market values at the end of each reporting period 
as allowed by generally accepted accounting principles  the company elected the fair value option for recording the mutual fund investment assets 
therefore  market value changes for the mutual fund investment assets are recorded in the income statement in the same periods that the offsetting changes in the deferred compensation liabilities are recorded 
dividends  capital gains distributed by the mutual funds  unrealized gains and losses and realized gains and losses from sales of mutual fund shares  are recognized as investment income or loss in the other  net line of the consolidated statements of income 
environmental liabilities it is the company s accounting policy to record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within a range of possible costs is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
estimates for environmental liabilities are subject to significant fluctuations as new facts emerge related to the various sites where the company is exposed to liability for the remediation of environmental contamination 
see the environmental and legal matters section of this md a for discussion of the company s recorded liabilities and range of loss estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
for arrangements where the company consigns product to a customer location  revenue is recognized when the customer uses the inventory 
the company records shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
volume discounts due customers are estimated and recorded in the same period as the sales to which the discounts relate and reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements  included in part ii  item  for information on recent accounting pronouncements  which affect the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk because the company operates globally  its cash flows and operating results are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manufactures and sells products in many foreign locations and  therefore  believes its currency exchange risk is well diversified 
except as noted below  substantially all the company s foreign subsidiaries financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
gains and losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are recorded in income 
the company uses forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain foreign currency transactions and balances to fluctuating exchange rates 
at december   the company had forward contracts to sell million on behalf of subsidiaries in canada  mexico  and france 
at year end the company had forward contracts to buy million on behalf of subsidiaries in germany and the philippines 
the company also had a forward contract to sell eur million on behalf of its subsidiary in poland 
at december  the company had a forward contract to purchase sgd million on behalf of a subsidiary in singapore where the functional currency is the us dollar 
periodically  the company and its subsidiaries issue us dollar and euro denominated trade receivables or loans to each other 
gains and losses on these transactions are included in income 
except for the company s subsidiaries in brazil  colombia  and china  foreign currency exposures are essentially all covered by forward contracts 
as of december   the company had net receivables of million due from its brazilian subsidiary that were subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
hypothetical fluctuations of percent in the exchange rate of the brazilian real would result in a gain or loss of million 
interest rates the company s debt was made up of fixed rate and variable rate borrowings totaling million and million  respectively  as of december  for  it is projected that interest on short term variable rate borrowings will total approximately million 
a hypothetical percent average change to short term interest rates would result in a million increase or decrease to interest expense for the fair value of the company s long term fixed rate debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million as of december   which was approximately million above the carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase to the fair value that would result from a hypothetical percent decrease in the company s weighted average long term borrowing rates at december   or million 
commodity price risk certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products are subject to price volatility caused by weather  petroleum prices  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
increased raw material costs are recovered from customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements that allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent the recovery of cost increases from customers  particularly in periods where there is excess industry capacity 
as a result  for some product lines or market segments it may take time to recover raw material price increases 
periodically  firm purchase commitments are entered into which fix the price of a specific commodity that will be delivered at a future time 
forward purchase contracts are used to aid in managing the company s natural gas and electric costs 
at december   the company had open forward contracts for the purchase of million dekatherms of natural gas at a cost of million 
because the company has agreed to fixed prices for the noted quantity of natural gas  a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of natural gas would cause the company s actual natural gas cost to be million higher or lower than the cost at market price 
also at december   the company had contracts to purchase approximately  megawatt hours of electricity at a cost of million 
because the company has agreed to fixed prices for the noted quantity of electricity  a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of electricity would cause the company s actual electric cost to be million higher or lower than the cost at market price
