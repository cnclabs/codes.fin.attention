increasing dependence on our mortgage business may increase volatility in our consolidated revenues and earnings and our residential mortgage lending profitability could be significantly reduced if we are not able to originate and sell mortgage loans at profitable margins 
changes in interest rates may change the value of our msr portfolio which may increase the volatility of our earnings 
certain hedging strategies that we use to manage investment in msrs  mortgage loans held for sale and interest rate lock commitments may be ineffective to offset any adverse changes in the fair value of these assets due to changes in interest rates and market liquidity 
our mortgage loan repurchase reserve for losses could be insufficient 
a significant increase in certain loan balances associated with our mortgage business may result in liquidity risk related to the funding of these loans

introduction we are the holding company of the bank  a commercial bank headquartered in chicago 
the bank specializes in serving the banking needs of closely held businesses and the people who manage them 
through its national businesses  the bank also provides asset based lending  residential mortgage lending and commercial equipment leasing through a growing network of offices throughout the united states 
at december   we had assets of billion  deposits of billion and stockholders equity of million 
the following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors affecting our consolidated financial condition at december  and december  and results of operations for the years ended december   december   and december  this discussion should be read together with the selected financial data  our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data contained elsewhere in this report 
in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform  in all material respects  to us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and general reporting practices within the financial services industry 
for additional details  see notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting and reporting policies from our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available to us as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments made by us are based on historical experience  current information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
certain accounting policies inherently have greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than actual outcomes 
we consider our policies for the allowance for loan losses  income taxes  the valuation of derivative financial instruments  the valuation of investment securities and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights to be critical accounting policies 

table of contents the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include a general allowance computed by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio and specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio categories 
we maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level that we consider sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors including historical charge off experience  changes in the size of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent  criticized and impaired loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position  work out plans and estimated collateral values under various liquidation scenarios to estimate the risk and amount of loss on loans to those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the uncertainties surrounding not only our borrowers probability of default  but also the fair value of the underlying collateral 
continuing illiquidity in the chicago area real estate market has maintained the recent relative uncertainty with respect to real estate values 
because of the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of valuations to the underlying assumptions regarding holding periods until sale and the collateral liquidation method  our actual losses may materially vary from our current estimates 
our non consumer loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses 
these loans are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and  therefore  have the potential for higher losses for each loan 
due to their size  larger loans can cause greater volatility in our reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate for any one loan may have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss estimates 
because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of any one or a few of these loans could cause an increase in uncollectible loans and our allowance for loan losses 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  our allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states and the states and other jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination of income tax expense or benefit and the amounts of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities involve the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgment 
factors considered include interpretations of federal and state income tax laws  current financial accounting standards  the difference between the tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities temporary differences  assessment of the likelihood that the reversal of deferred deductible temporary difference will yield tax benefits  and estimates of reserves required for tax uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities  will not differ from management s current assessment  the impact of which could be significant to future results 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the pre tax income reported on our consolidated financial statements and taxable income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as an income tax benefit or income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
the determination of the realizability of the net deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  forecasts of future taxable income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
we currently do not maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets because management has determined that it is more likely than not that these net deferred tax assets will be realized 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments derivatives  including interest rate swaps and corridor agreements  interest rate swaptions  callable interest rate swap agreements  as well as interest rate lock and forward loan sale commitments  to either accommodate individual customer needs or to assist in our interest rate risk management 
all derivatives are measured and 
table of contents reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative  as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the effective portion of the hedged risk  is recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in the fair value 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income oci and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
for all hedging relationships  derivative gains and losses that are not effective in hedging the changes in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings during the period of the change in fair value 
similarly  the changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as an accounting hedge are also reported currently in earnings 
at the inception of a formally designated hedge and quarterly thereafter  an assessment is made to determine whether changes in the fair value or cash flows of the derivatives have been highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future 
if it is determined that derivatives are not highly effective as a hedge  hedge accounting is discontinued for the period 
once hedge accounting is terminated  all changes in fair value of the derivatives are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations in other noninterest income  which could result in greater volatility in our earnings 
the estimates of fair values of certain of our derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps and corridors  are calculated by an independent pricing service which uses valuation models to estimate market based valuations 
the valuations are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis of the expected cash flow of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivative and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves and implied volatilities 
in addition  the fair value estimate also incorporates a credit valuation adjustment to reflect the risk of nonperformance by both us and our counterparties in the fair value measurement 
the resulting fair values produced by these proprietary valuation models are in part theoretical and  therefore  can vary between derivative dealers and are not necessarily reflective of the actual price at which the derivative contract could be traded 
small changes in assumptions can result in significant changes in valuation 
the risks inherent in the determination of the fair value of a derivative may result in volatility in our earnings 
the fair value of forward loan sale commitments is based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets that we have the ability to access 
we use an external valuation model that relies on internally developed inputs to estimate the fair value of our interest rate lock commitments 
valuation of investment securities the fair value of our investment securities portfolio is determined in accordance with us gaap  which requires that we classify financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three level fair value hierarchy 
the determination of fair value is highly subjective and requires management to rely on estimates  assumptions  and judgments that can affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we obtain the fair value of investment securities from an independent pricing service 
we periodically review the pricing methodology for each significant class of assets used by this third party pricing service to assess the compliance with accounting standards for fair value measurement and classification in the fair value measurement hierarchy 
the fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes  market spreads  cash flows  the us treasury bond yield curve  live trading levels  trade execution data  market consensus prepayment speeds  credit information  including credit spreads and current rating from credit rating agencies  and the bond s terms and conditions  among other things 
while we use an independent pricing service to obtain the fair values of our investment portfolio  we employ certain control procedures to determine the reasonableness of the valuations 
we validate the overall reasonableness of the fair values by comparing information obtained from our independent pricing service to other third party valuation sources for selected assets and review the valuations and any significant differences in valuations with members of management who have the relevant technical expertise to assess the results 
in addition  we review the third party valuation methodology on a periodic basis 
each quarter we review our investment securities portfolio to determine whether unrealized losses are temporary or other than temporary  based on an evaluation of the creditworthiness of the issuers guarantors  as well as the underlying collateral  if applicable 
our analysis includes an evaluation of the type of security  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the security s carrying value  the characteristics of the underlying collateral  the degree of credit support provided by subordinate tranches within the total issuance  independent credit ratings  changes in credit ratings and a cash flow analysis  considering default rates  loss severities based upon the location of the collateral  and estimated prepayments 
those securities with unrealized losses for more than months and for more than of their carrying value are subjected to further analysis to determine if we expect to receive all the contractual cash flows 
we use other independent pricing sources to obtain fair value estimates and perform discounted cash flow analysis for selected securities 
when the discounted cash flow analysis 
table of contents obtained from those independent pricing sources indicates that we expect all future principal and interest payments will be received in accordance with their original contractual terms  we do not intend to sell the security  and we more likely than not will not be required to sell the security before recovery  the unrealized loss is deemed temporary 
if such analysis shows that we do not expect to be able to recover our entire investment  an other than temporary impairment charge will be recorded in current earnings for the amount of the credit loss component 
the amount of impairment related to factors other than the credit loss is recognized in oci 
our assessments of creditworthiness and the resultant expected cash flows are complicated by the uncertainties surrounding not only the specific security and its underlying collateral but also the severity of the current overall economic downturn 
our cash flow estimates for mortgage related securities are based on estimates of mortgage default rates  severity of loss and prepayments 
changes in assumptions can result in material changes in expected cash flows 
therefore  unrealized losses that we have determined to be temporary may at a later date be determined to be other than temporary and may have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights the company originates and sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and may retain the right to service the loans sold 
servicing involves the collection of payments from individual borrowers and the distribution of those payments to the investors or master servicer 
upon a sale of mortgage loans for which servicing rights are retained  the retained mortgage servicing rights asset is capitalized at the fair value of future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing servicing activities 
mortgage servicing rights may also be acquired in a bulk purchase 
purchased mortgage servicing rights are recorded at the purchase price at the date of purchase and at fair value thereafter 
mortgage servicing rights do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices 
the company determines the fair value of mortgage servicing rights by estimating the fair value of the future cash flows associated with the mortgage loans being serviced 
key economic assumptions used in measuring the fair value of mortgage servicing rights include  but are not limited to  prepayment speeds  discount rates  delinquencies and cost to service 
the assumptions used in the model are validated on a periodic basis 
the fair value is validated on a quarterly basis with an independent third party 
material discrepancies between the internal valuation and the third party valuation are analyzed and an internal committee determines whether or not an adjustment should be made to bring the internal valuation in line with the external valuation 
the company has elected to account for mortgage servicing rights using the fair value option 
changes in the fair value are recognized in mortgage banking revenue on the company consolidated statement of operations 
outlook we believe our results for have reinforced the value of our dual strategy of focusing on the fundamentals of our business while continuing to diversify our revenue sources 
our c i banking business is the core of our banking segment 
our experienced business bankers are dedicated to providing closely held businesses with comprehensive banking solutions 
while providing this high level of service  we continue to focus on asset quality 
loan resolutions  assets sales and other remediation efforts have substantially improved the credit quality of our loan portfolio over the past few years 
to complement our c i business  we continue to expand our national presence through our asset based lending group  our residential mortgage lending operation and our newest business line  our commercial equipment finance group 
these groups provide geographic as well as balance sheet and revenue diversification 
our strong performance in allowed us to make investments for further diversification and expansion in our lines of business and facilitated the completion of a million preferred stock offering in the fourth quarter of we believe that each of our businesses have meaningful potential for continued growth and we will continue to focus on this grow and diversify strategy in and beyond 

table of contents results of operations overview net income applicable to common stockholders was million  or per diluted common share for the year ended december   compared to net income applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share for the year ended december  this decrease in net income applicable to common stockholders from to was primarily due to the inclusion in of a million income tax benefit resulting from the reversal of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset for which no comparable income tax benefit existed in excluding the favorable impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance  the loss per common share was for the year ended december  in  strong mortgage banking revenue  a decrease in the provision for loan losses and decreased funding costs contributed to net income applicable to common stockholders

our results  in combination with management s belief that we have achieved sustainable profitability  supported the reversal of the previously established million valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset 
this reversal  in combination with our business line growth  resulted in net income applicable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  reconciliation of us gaap financial measures our accounting and reporting policies conform to us gaap and general practice within the banking industry 
management also uses certain non gaap financial measures to evaluate the company s financial performance such as the non gaap measures of pre tax  pre provision operating earnings and of revenue 
management believes that these measures are useful because they provide a comparable basis for evaluating financial performance from operations period to period 
pre tax  pre provision operating earnings is a non gaap financial measure in which provision for loan losses  nonperforming asset expense and certain non recurring items  such as gains and losses on investment securities  debt extinguishment expense and derivative termination fees are excluded from income before taxes 
revenue is a non gaap financial measure calculated as net interest income plus noninterest income less gains and losses on investment securities and derivative termination fees

table of contents net interest income net interest income is an important source of our earnings and is the difference between total interest income and fees generated by interest earning assets and total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the level of rates earned or incurred on those assets and liabilities 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was during as compared to during net interest margin increased due to a reduction in funding costs partially offset by lower yields on loans and investment securities 
the yield on interest earning assets was for compared to for the decrease was due to lower rates on investment securities and loans 
the yield on investment securities declined from for to for due to the generally lower interest rate environment 
the loan yield decreased from for to for a large portion of this variance is due to growth in mortgage loans originated by cole taylor mortgage  which increased average loan balances 
these loans generally carry a lower yield than commercial loans and  therefore  lowered the overall yield on loan balances 
average commercial and commercial real estate loan balances decreased million and the average rates earned on these loans declined basis points from to the rate on total interest bearing liabilities declined from for to for this decrease was primarily a result of transactions undertaken to change our funding mix and lower funding costs 
actions taken to reduce funding costs included the termination of certain derivative contracts  early extinguishment of repurchase agreements and other long term debt and the prepayment of million of the bank subordinated notes 
in addition  we also experienced anticipated significant deposit repricing  primarily in customer certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposits 
average interest earning assets during were billion as compared to billion during  an increase of million  or 
average investment balances decreased million  or  between those two periods while average loan balances increased million  or 
the increase in average loan balances was due primarily to growth in residential mortgage loans held for sale and held in portfolio 
average interest bearing deposits balances decreased to billion for  compared to billion for  a decrease of million due to a decrease in time deposits partially offset by an increase in interest bearing demand deposits 
average noninterest bearing deposit balances increased from million in to million in  an increase of million largely due to an increase in consumer checking accounts related to an organization that provides electronic financial disbursements and payment services to the higher education industry

year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million in  a decrease of million  or  from million in net interest margin of in was down slightly from in  as decreases in the yield on most interest earning assets were largely offset by continued decreases in our funding costs 
the lower funding costs were a result of deposit repricing and deliberate changes made to the funding mix 
the interest earning asset yield declined to in from in due to decreased yields on both loans and investment securities 
the yield earned on loans decreased to during from in the yield on our investment securities portfolio also declined to in from in the rate on total interest bearing liabilities dropped from in to in significant  anticipated deposit repricing occurred in  largely in customer certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposit 
the decline in yield was also due in part to funding related transactions  including the termination of certain derivative contracts and early 
table of contents extinguishments of debt in we determined that these actions were in our best long term economic interest  despite the recognition of short term losses and expenses 
our average interest earning assets during were billion  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the billion of average interest earning assets during the decrease was driven by lower loan balances  primarily in the commercial real estate secured portfolio  excluding commercial owner occupied real estate loans  due to pay downs and nonperforming loan resolutions during offsetting this decline was an increase in consumer loans  largely due to certain mortgages originated by cole taylor mortgage being held in the loan portfolio rather than being sold in the secondary market 
our average interest bearing liabilities decreased from billion in to billion in  a decrease of million or 
short term borrowings increased million  or  from million in to million in offsetting this was a decrease in long term borrowings  which decreased from million in to million in  an decrease of million or 
these actions were taken to shift the funding mix to lower the overall cost of funds 
average interest bearing deposit balances of billion in were slightly lower than balances of billion during total deposits increased due to growth in average noninterest bearing deposit balances  which increased million  or to million during  as compared to million in with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income for was million  compared to million for this non gaap presentation is discussed below under tax equivalent adjustments to yields and margins 
tax equivalent adjustments to yields and margins as part of our evaluation of net interest income  we analyze our consolidated average balances  our yield on average interest earning assets and the cost of average interest bearing liabilities 
such yields and costs are calculated by dividing annualized income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities 
because management analyzes net interest income on a tax equivalent basis  the analysis contains certain non gaap financial measures 
in these non gaap financial measures  investment interest income  loan interest income  total interest income and net interest income are adjusted to reflect tax exempt interest income on a tax equivalent basis  assuming a tax rate of 
this assumed tax rate may differ from our actual effective income tax rate 
in addition  the interest earning asset yield  net interest margin and the net interest rate spread are adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
we believe that these measures and ratios present a more meaningful measure of the performance of interest earning assets because they provide a better basis for comparison of net interest income regardless of the mix of taxable and tax exempt instruments

for additional information concerning this determination  see application of critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  nonperforming assets  impaired loans and allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the decrease in provision expense was due to lower specific reserves required on impaired loans and lower nonperforming loans in compared to nonperforming loans and commercial criticized and classified loans decreased in as a result of significant nonperforming asset resolutions  combined with a slowdown in both migrations to nonperforming status and inflows to criticized and classified status

mortgage banking revenue generated by cole taylor mortgage totaled million in  an increase of million from  primarily driven by sustained low mortgage interest rates which resulted in a greater volume of mortgage originations and loan sales at higher margins 
loan origination margins in were wider relative to past years and are beginning to decline 
mortgage banking revenue also increased due to an increase in mortgage servicing revenue due to an increase in the amount of loans serviced for others  a portion of which is due to mortgage servicing purchased in and a portion of which is servicing retained on loans originated and sold into the secondary market 
we derive service charges principally from deposit accounts 
service charge income is affected by a number of factors  such as the volume of deposit accounts and service transactions  the price established for each deposit service  the earnings credit rate and the collected balances customers maintain in their commercial checking accounts 
service charges increased from million in to million in due to pricing adjustments which began in the first quarter of  the introduction of new products  and customer additions throughout and gains on the sale of investment securities increased from million in to million in in  we sold investment securities at the same time as an early extinguishment of debt transaction occurred 
in addition  we recognized gains related to a covered call option transaction 
in the year ended december   investment securities with higher repayment risk were sold due to uncertainty regarding the refinancing of the underlying collateral 
this resulted in a million gain recognized in gains on the sale of investment securities 
other derivative income decreased from million in to million in due to a decrease in the volume of customer swap transactions and related fees collected 
derivative income in included net termination expense of  related to the termination of certain derivative contracts 
there were no derivative termination fees in impairment charges included in other noninterest income were  in and  in year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total noninterest income during totaled million  down from million during  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was driven by a higher level of gains on sales of investment securities in  partially offset by increased mortgage banking revenue and increased other derivative income in service charges increased slightly from million in to million in due to increases in commercial account service charges and foreign exchange service charges 
mortgage banking revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase was due to a rise in loan fundings at cole taylor mortgage related to sustained low mortgage interest 
table of contents rates and continued expansion of the national platform 
also contributing to the increase was growth in mortgage servicing activities  including retained servicing and purchased mortgage servicing rights 
in  we sold mortgage backed securities from our available for sale investment securities portfolio to minimize prepayment risk 
we recorded net gains on the sales of available for sale investment securities of million in this compares to gains of million in mortgage backed securities that had been experiencing higher than anticipated prepayments were sold in to take advantage of the low level of interest rates and tightening spread in the market 
other derivative income was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase was due to higher volumes on interest rate swap agreements entered into by commercial clients of our banking segment

in  three structured repurchase agreements were terminated and we incurred million in early extinguishment of debt expense related to these terminations 
outside services expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was largely due to a volume driven increase in loan expense  net 
our efficiency ratio was in  compared to in the improvement was the result of higher noninterest income in  primarily due to increased mortgage banking revenue and other derivative income  combined with a decrease in noninterest expense due to lower nonperforming asset expense in income taxes income tax expense increased from a benefit of million for the year ended december  to an expense of million for the year ended december   an increase in expense of million 
this increase was primarily due to the release in of our million valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets and an increase in our income before income taxes  which increased from million in for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in  we established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
we released the million valuation allowance in as of december   the net deferred tax asset totaled million  which  in the judgment of management  will more likely than not be fully realized 
the largest components of the deferred tax asset are associated with the allowance for loan losses  employee benefits  basis adjustments on our portfolio of oreo and federal and state net operating loss carry forwards 
we are largely relying on earnings forecasted earnings in future years in making the determination that we will more likely than not realize our deferred tax asset 
in making this determination  we considered our recent earnings trends and the prospects that the key drivers of profitability will continue in the future 
beginning in  we operated under a strategy previously referred to as fix and grow 
this strategy focused on remediating asset quality issues while simultaneously growing and diversifying our earnings stream 
after experiencing several years of significant losses  we recorded pre tax book income of million in and million in the improved operating results are mainly due to growth in our mortgage operations  a decrease in the provision for loan losses and growth in our commercial and industrial portfolio 
for purposes of this determination  we used forecasts of future earnings that do not rely on significant increases in the level of profitability to realize our deferred tax asset 
in addition  the forecasts do not rely on asset sales  non routine transactions  a material change in the relationship between taxable income and pre tax income recorded on our financial statements or any tax strategies 
earnings forecasts are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could impact our operations 
for a description of the various risks and uncertainties impacting our operations  see the risk factors section in this report 
in addition to the reversal of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset  income tax expense during included the release of the residual tax effects of changes in the beginning of the year valuation allowance previously allocated to oci 
this is partially offset by an income tax benefit due to a change in the state of illinois tax rate as applied to our january  net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance

the banking segment consists of commercial banking  commercial real estate banking  asset based lending  retail banking  equipment financing and all other functions that support those units 
the mortgage banking segment originates residential mortgage loans for sale to investors and for retention in our loan portfolio through retail and broker channels 
this segment also services residential mortgage loans for various investors and for our own loans 
in addition  we use an other category  which includes subordinated note expense  certain parent company activities and residual income tax expense  representing the difference between the actual amount incurred and the amount allocated to operating segments 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net income for the banking segment for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from net income of million for the year ended december  the improved performance was primarily attributable to a million decrease in provision for loan losses see provision for loan losses for additional detail 
net interest income increased from million in to million in due to decreased funding costs  partially offset by compressed commercial loan yields

loan origination margins are beginning to decline 
noninterest expense increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefits expense and incentive compensation expense due to additional headcount and an increase in commission based incentive compensation 
volume related loan expenses also increased

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes presented elsewhere in this report have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the measurement of our financial position and operating results in terms of historical amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  in management s opinion  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or  to the same extent  as the price of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including changes in the expected rate of inflation  the influences of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities  among other factors 
financial condition overview total assets increased billion  or  to billion at december  from total assets of billion at december   primarily as a result of increases in loans held for sale  loans and mortgage servicing rights 
total liabilities increased million to billion at december  from billion at december   primarily resulting from higher noninterest bearing deposits and short term borrowings  partially offset by decreases in long term borrowings and subordinated notes 
total stockholders equity at december  was million as compared to million at december   reflecting the impact of net income for the twelve months ended december   the sale of the new series a preferred and an increase in the unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities  partially offset by the repurchase of a warrant to purchase shares of the company common stock previously held by the us treasury

investment securities our investment portfolio is designed to provide a source of income with minimal risk of loss  a source of liquidity and interest rate risk management opportunities 
in managing our investment portfolio within the composition of the entire balance sheet  we balance our earnings  credit  interest rate risk  and liquidity considerations  with a goal of maximizing longer term overall profitability

during the twelve months ending december   in addition to principal paydowns we purchased million of investment securities  mostly mortgage related securities and municipal obligations  and sold million of available for sale investment securities 
in  the company transferred million of investment securities from available for sale to held to maturity 
the company has the intent and ability to hold these investment securities until maturity 
as of december   mortgage related securities at estimated fair value comprised approximately of our investment portfolio 
almost all of the securities were issued by government and government sponsored enterprises 
at december   we had a net unrealized gain of million in our available for sale investment portfolio  which was comprised of million of gross unrealized gains and million of gross unrealized losses 
at december   the net unrealized gain was million  which was comprised of million of gross unrealized gains and million of gross unrealized losses 
the gross unrealized losses for securities that have been in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months at december  related to two investment securities with a carrying value of million 
each quarter we analyze each of these securities to determine if other than temporary impairment has occurred 
the factors we consider include the magnitude of the unrealized loss in comparison to the security s carrying value  the length of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position and the current independent bond rating for the security 
those securities with unrealized losses for more than months and for more than of their carrying value are subject to further analyses to determine if it is probable that not all the contractual cash flows will be received 
we obtain fair value estimates from additional independent sources and perform cash flow analysis to determine if other than temporary impairment has occurred 
of the two securities with gross unrealized losses at december   one has been in a loss position for months or more over of amortized cost and therefore subject to further review 
on analysis  it was determined that there was no additional expected credit loss 
therefore  we expect to recover our entire investment and no other than temporary impairment charge was recorded in the twelve months ended december

table of contents loans the composition of our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated was as follows as of december  dollars in thousands loans commercial and industrial commercial real estate secured residential construction and land commercial construction and land lease receivables total commercial loans consumer loans gross loans less unearned discount loans less allowance for loan losses portfolio loans  net loans held for sale gross loans increased million to billion at december   from gross loans of billion at december  commercial loans  which include c i  commercial real estate secured  construction and land loans and lease receivables  increased million  or 
the increase in commercial loans during the twelve months ended december  consisted of a million  or  increase in c i loans  an increase in lease receivables of million and an increase in commercial construction and land of million  or 
these increases were partly offset by a decrease of million  or  in commercial real estate secured loans and a decrease of million  or  in residential construction and land loans 
consumer loans increased by million  or  from december  to december  c i loans are made to businesses or to individuals on either a secured or unsecured basis for a wide range of business purposes  terms  and maturities 
these loans are made primarily in the form of seasonal or working capital loans or term loans 
repayment of these loans is generally provided through the operating cash flow of the borrower 
the risk characteristics of c i loans are largely influenced by general economic conditions  such as inflation  recessionary pressures  the rate of unemployment  changes in interest rates and money supply  and other factors that affect the borrower s operations and the value of the underlying collateral 
our credit risk strategy emphasizes consistent underwriting standards and diversification by industry and customer size 
our c i loan portfolio is comprised of loans made to a variety of businesses in a diverse range of industries 
this portfolio diversification is a significant factor used to mitigate the risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions 
c i loans also include those loans made by our asset based lending division 
asset based loans are made to businesses with the primary source of repayment derived from payments on the related assets securing the loan 
collateral for these loans may include accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and other fixed assets  and is monitored regularly to ensure ongoing sufficiency of collateral coverage and quality 
the primary risk for these loans is a significant decline in collateral values due to general market conditions 
loan terms that mitigate these risks include typical industry amortization schedules  percentage of collateral coverage  maintenance of cash collateral accounts and regular asset monitoring 
because of the national scope of our asset based lending  the risk of these loans is also diversified by geography 
total c i loans increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december   and accounted for of our loans at december  a portion of this increase is due c i loans originated by the commercial equipment finance group that was started in in addition  loans originated by our asset based lending group increased 

table of contents commercial real estate loans on completed properties include loans for the purchase of real property or for other business purposes where the primary collateral is the underlying real property 
our commercial real estate loans consist of loans on commercial owner occupied properties and investment properties 
investment properties refer to multi family residences and income producing non owner occupied commercial real estate  including retail strip centers or malls  office and mixed use properties and other commercial and specialized properties  such as nursing homes  churches  hotels and motels 
repayment of these loans is generally provided through the operating cash flow of the property 
the risk in a commercial real estate loan depends primarily on the loan amount in relation to the value of the underlying collateral  the interest rate  and the borrower s ability to repay in a timely fashion 
the credit risk of these loans is influenced by general economic and market conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower s operation of the owner occupied business or upon the fluctuation in value and earnings performance of an income producing property 
in addition  the value of the underlying collateral is influenced by local real estate market trends and general economic conditions 
credit risk is managed in this portfolio through underwriting standards  knowledge of the local real estate markets  periodic reviews of the loan collateral and the borrowers financial condition 
in addition  all commercial real estate loans are supported by an independent third party appraisal at inception

the remainder of this portfolio consists of loans secured by residential income properties 
over the past few years we have intentionally reduced our commercial non owner occupied balances while at the same time increasing our commercial owner occupied balances 
residential construction and land loans primarily consist of loans to real estate developers to construct single family homes  town homes and condominium conversions 
commercial construction and land loans primarily consist of loans to construct commercial real estate or income producing properties 
both the residential and commercial construction and land loans are repaid from proceeds from the sale of the finished units by the developer or may be converted to commercial real estate loans at the completion of the construction process 
the risk characteristics of these loans are influenced by national and local economic conditions  including the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence and the related impact that these conditions have on demand  housing prices and real estate values 
in addition  credit risk on individual projects is influenced by the developers ability and efficiency in completing construction  selling finished units or obtaining tenants to occupy these properties 
credit risk for these loans is primarily managed by underwriting standards  lending primarily in local markets to developers with whom we have experience and ongoing oversight of project progress 
our residential construction and land loans decreased by million  or  to million at december   as compared to million at december  over the past several years we have intentionally reduced balances in this loan category 
commercial construction and land loans totaled million at december  as compared to million at december   an increase of million  or 

table of contents our lease financing business offers a full range of equipment finance options and specializes in originating and syndicating commercial equipment leases for us middle market companies 
we have a general equipment focus with limited specialization of equipment types 
the risk characteristics of equipment leases are similar to those of c i loans and are largely influenced by general economic conditions  such as inflation  recessionary pressures  the rate of unemployment and other factors that affect the borrower operations and the value of the underlying equipment 
our credit risk strategy emphasizes consistent underwriting standards and diversification by industry and customer size 
in addition to credit risk  equipment leases may entail residual value risk 
residual values are thoroughly analyzed prior to entering into a lease and closely monitored during the term 
lease conditions also mitigate residual risk 
our approach places syndication at the front end of the sales process which enables market confirmation of our judgment as to structure  term  residual and price  however  we have not syndicated any leases as of december  our leasing business has a national focus which also diversifies our risk geographically 
our lease receivables totaled million net of unearned discounts at december  as this business line was launched in july  we had no lease receivables at december  our consumer loans consist of open and closed end credit extended to individuals for household  family  and other personal expenditures 
consumer loans primarily include loans to individuals secured by their personal residence  including first mortgages and home equity and home improvement loans 
the primary risks in consumer lending are loss of income of the borrower that can result from job losses or unforeseen personal hardships due to medical or family issues that may impact repayment 
in the case of first and second mortgage or home equity lending  a significant reduction in the value of the asset financed can influence a borrower s ability to repay the loan 
because the size of consumer loans is typically smaller than commercial loans  the risk of loss on an individual consumer loan is usually less than that of a commercial loan 
credit risk for these loans is managed by reviewing creditworthiness of the borrower  monitoring payment histories and obtaining adequate collateral positions 
total consumer loans increased million  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  this increase was the result of certain mortgages originated by cole taylor mortgage being held in the loan portfolio rather than sold in the secondary market

these transfers are expected to have a nominal impact on the allowance for loan losses 
several credit ratios have been revised to exclude loans held for sale from total loans 
prior period ratios have been adjusted where necessary to reflect this change 
the following table presents loans past due to days and still accruing interest as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands loans contractually past due through days and still accruing interest days past due to total loans several credit ratios have been revised to exclude loans held for sale from total loans 
prior period ratios have been adjusted to reflect this change 
nonperforming loans nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and interest accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more 
we evaluate all loans on which principal or interest is contractually past due days or more to determine if they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
if sufficient doubt exists as to the full collection of principal and interest on a loan  we place it on nonaccrual and no longer recognize interest income 
after a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any current period interest previously accrued but not yet collected is reversed against current income 
interest is included in income subsequent to the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status only as interest is received and so long as management is satisfied that there is a high probability that principal will be collected in full 
the loan is returned to accrual status only when the borrower has made required payments for a minimum length of time and demonstrates the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled 
c i nonaccrual loans are the largest category of nonaccrual loans at million at december  and comprise approximately of all nonaccrual loans 
the largest decrease in nonaccrual loans for the twelve months ended december  was million  or  in c i loans

the loans transferred primarily consisted of million from our c i portfolio  million from our commercial real estate secured portfolio   from our residential construction and land portfolio  million from our commercial construction and land portfolio and million from our consumer portfolio 
during the twelve months ended december   we received net proceeds of million on the sale of oreo that had a carrying value of million 
this resulted in a net gain of million  which was included in nonperforming asset expense in noninterest expense 
we also reduced the carrying value of certain oreo and repossessed assets by million during the twelve months ended december  to reflect a decrease in the estimated fair value of those assets 
this decrease was recorded as either additional nonperforming asset expense or provision for loan losses for assets recently transferred from the loan portfolio

the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans decreased during and totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  and million at december  the decrease in the allowance for losses on impaired loans in was primarily due to charge offs and resolutions 
the percentage of allowance on impaired loans to total impaired loans decreased to at december   compared to at december  commercial real estate secured loans comprised approximately of all impaired loans and of the allowance for loan losses on impaired loans at december  through an individual impairment analysis  we determined that at december   million of our impaired loans had a specific measure of impairment and required a related allowance for loan losses of million 
we also held million of impaired loans for which the individual analysis did not result in a measure of impairment and  therefore  no related allowance for loan losses was provided 
once we determine a loan is impaired  we perform an individual analysis to establish the amount of the related allowance for loan losses  if any  based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that collateral dependent loans may be measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  less estimated cost to sell 
because the majority of our impaired loans are collateral dependent real estate loans  the fair value is determined by a current appraisal 
the individual impairment analysis also takes into account available and reliable borrower guarantees and any cross collateralization agreements 
certain other loans are collateralized by business assets  such as equipment  inventory  and accounts receivable 
the fair value of these loans is based on estimates of realizability and collectability of the underlying collateral 
while impaired loans exhibit weaknesses that may inhibit repayment in compliance with the original note terms  the impairment analysis may not result in a related allowance for loan losses for each individual loan 
for impaired commercial loans that are collateral dependent  our practice is to obtain an updated appraisal every six to months  depending on the nature and type of the collateral and the stability of collateral valuations  as determined by senior members of credit management 
oreo and repossessed assets require an updated appraisal at least annually 
we have established policies and procedures related to appraisals and maintain a list of approved appraisers who have met specific criteria 
in addition  our policy for appraisals on real estate dependent commercial loans generally requires each appraisal to have an independent compliance and technical review by a qualified third party to ensure the consistency and quality of the appraisal and valuation 
we discount appraisals for estimated selling costs  and  when appropriate  consider the date of the appraisal and stability of the local real estate market when analyzing the estimated fair value of individual impaired loans that are collateral dependent 
impaired loans include all nonaccrual loans and accruing loans judged to have higher risk of noncompliance with the current contractual repayment schedule for both interest and principal  as well as troubled debt restructurings 
unless modified in a troubled debt restructuring  certain homogeneous loans  such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment and are  therefore  excluded from impaired loans 
at december   we held million of loans classified as performing restructured loans performing troubled debt restructurings which includes commercial loans of million and consumer loans of million 
the balance of nonaccrual and impaired loans as of december  is presented below nonaccrual loans impaired loans dollars in thousands commercial nonaccrual loans commercial loans on accrual but impaired n a consumer loans potential problem loans as part of our standard credit administration process  we risk rate our commercial loan portfolio 
as part of this process  loans that are rated with a higher level of risk are monitored more closely 
we internally identify certain loans in our loan risk ratings that we have placed on heightened monitoring because of certain weaknesses that may inhibit the borrower s ability to perform under the contractual terms of the loan agreement but have not reached the status of nonaccrual loans 
at december   these potential problem loans totaled million 
of these potential problem loans at december   million were in our commercial real estate construction and land portfolio  million were in our c i portfolio and  were in our commercial construction and land loans 
in comparison  potential problem loans at december  totaled million 
the potential problem loans at december  included million of construction and land 
table of contents loans  million of c i loans and million of commercial real estate secured loans 
we do not necessarily expect to realize losses on potential problem loans  but we recognize potential problem loans can carry a higher probability of default and may require additional attention by management 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include the formula described below and specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio categories 
we calculate the formula portion of the allowance by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio 
the loans are categorized by loan type as commercial and industrial  commercial real estate secured  residential real estate construction  commercial real estate construction loans  residential real estate mortgage  commercial equipment finance loans and lease receivables  and consumer loans 
those categories are further segregated by risk classification for commercial loans and by delinquency status for consumer loans 
each commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loan has a risk grade based on formal defined criteria 
for consumer loans  we further categorize the loans into consumer loan product types  such as residential mortgage loans and home equity loans 
segregation of the loans into more discrete pools facilitates greater precision in matching historic and expected loan losses with the source of the loss 
we adjust these pools from time to time  based on the changing composition of the loan portfolio  grouping loans with similar attributes and risk characteristics 
we calculate actual historic loss rates based upon current and prior year charge off experience for each separate loan grouping identified 
the historical loss rates are then weighted based on our evaluation of the duration of the economic cycle to arrive at a current expected loss rate 
the allowance in  and reflects loss experience from the prior three year period 
the current expected loss rates are adjusted  if deemed appropriate  for other relevant factors affecting the loan groupings  including changes in lending practices  trends in past due loans and industry  geographical  collateral and size concentrations 
finally  the resulting loss factors are multiplied by the current period loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 
impaired loans are evaluated with an individual analysis to establish the amount of related allowance for loan loss  if any 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is determined based on the present value of either expected future cash flows discounted at the loan effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
in recent periods  our estimate of the amount of loss on a loan secured by real estate has increased in complexity as a result of the current illiquidity in the real estate market 
the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of real estate valuations to the underlying assumptions regarding holding period until sale and the collateral liquidation method can have a material impact on our loss estimates on loans 
if the estimated recoverable amount of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a specific allowance is established 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
however  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations

capital resources we monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on the risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
generally  tier capital includes common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities up to certain limits 
bank regulators  however  also specifically approved the series b preferred for inclusion in tier capital in spite of its cumulative dividend feature 
tier capital is adjusted to exclude a portion of the net deferred tax asset and the mortgage servicing rights asset 
total capital represents tier capital plus a portion of the allowance for loan loss up to certain limits  subordinated debt and the portion of the trust preferred securities not includable in tier capital

the proposed rules would apply to all depository organizations in the united states and most of their parent companies and would increase minimum capital ratios  add a new minimum common equity ratio  add a new capital conservation buffer and would change the risk weightings of certain assets for the purposes of calculating certain capital ratios 
the comment period with respect to the proposed rules expired on october  but the federal bank regulatory agencies have postponed the effectiveness of any rules in this regard indefinitely 
management continues to assess the effect of the proposed rules on the company and the bank s capital positions and will monitor developments in this area 
it is unclear when the final rules will be adopted and what changes  if any  may be made to the proposed rules 
liquidity in addition to the normal influx of liquidity from in market deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments  the bank uses brokered deposits  borrowings from the fhlb and frb  broker dealer repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased to meet its liquidity needs 
during  we worked to improve our liquidity position by increasing funding from core customers which allowed us to reduce our reliance on brokered deposits 
we also used available collateral to take advantage of attractively priced short term funding provided by the fhlb 
we manage the risks associated with this reliance on wholesale funding sources by maintaining adequate alternate sources of funding and excess collateral available for immediate use 
at december   subject to available collateral  we had total pre approved overnight federal funds borrowing lines and repurchase agreement lines of million and million  respectively 
in addition  the bank is able to borrow from the frb under the bic program 
at december   the bank maintained million of commercial loans as collateral at the frb with a lendable value of approximately million 
the bank also has pledged million of investment securities and million of qualified first mortgage residential  home equity and commercial real estate loans at the fhlb and had a total borrowing capacity of million at december  the bank has further increased its ability to purchase federal funds by cultivating relationships with a growing group of correspondent banking customers who may sell federal funds to the bank in order to manage their excess liquidity 
our total assets increased to billion at december  from billion at december  during  our loan and loans held for sale increased by a net of million  or  while our investment securities portfolio decreased by million  or 
during  the mix of our funding liabilities also changed 
total deposits increased by million  or  and short term borrowings increased by million  or 
these increases were partly offset by decreasing long term borrowings by million  or interest received  net of interest paid  was the principal source of our operating cash inflows in each of the above periods 
management of investing and financing activities and market conditions determine the level and the stability of our net interest cash flows 
during  cash used in operating activities was million  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in and cash used of million in the increase in net cash used in operating activities in is due to an increase in loans originated for sale of billion  partially offset by an increase in cash proceeds from sales of loans of billion 
the change from to was caused by an increase in cash proceeds from loan sales of billion and an offsetting increase in loans originated for sale of million 
net outflows from investing activities totaled million during  compared to net outflows of million during our net outflow during was largely due to the purchase of million of available for sale investment securities  a million net increase in loans and the purchase of million of held to maturity securities 
this decrease was partly offset by proceeds from sales of available for sale securities of million and proceeds from principal payments and maturities of available for sale securities of million 
in comparison  the outflow from investing activities in was largely due to the purchase of million of available for sale investment securities and a million net increase in loans 
this decrease was partly offset by proceeds from principal payments and maturities of available for sale 
table of contents securities of million and million in proceeds from sales of available for sale securities 
net inflows from investing activities totaled million during  primarily due to proceeds from sales of available for sale securities of million and million of proceeds from principal payments and maturities of available for sale securities 
this increase was partially offset by purchases of billion of available for sale securities 
during  we had net inflows from financing activities of million  compared to million during the new inflows in are primarily attributable to the net increase in short term borrowings of million  the net increase in deposits of million and million from the issuance of preferred stock 
these inflows were offset by million repayments of long term borrowings and million repayment of subordinated notes 
during  the new inflows were primarily attributable to the increase of million of short term borrowings  an increase in deposits of million  net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million and the net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock of million

during  net inflows from financing activities included increased long term borrowings of million  an increase in deposits of million  net proceeds from the issuance of subordinated notes of million and net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock of million 
these inflows were partly offset by million repayments of long term borrowings 
holding company liquidity historically  the primary source of the company funds has been dividends received from the bank 
because of the net losses incurred by the bank in recent years  the bank did not declare or pay any dividends to the company in or the bank is subject to dividend restrictions set forth by regulatory authorities  under which the bank may not  without prior approval of regulatory authorities  declare dividends in excess of the sum of the current year s earnings plus the retained earnings from the prior two years 
the bank has agreed  consistent with past practice  to provide its regulators notice before the payment of dividends to the company 
at december   the company had cash of million for general corporate purposes and to support future growth 
the primary source of cash at the holding company was from the issuance of series a preferred 
in  we received net proceeds  after issuance costs  of million from the issuance of our series a preferred 
during  cash outflows at the company included million for the repurchase of the cpp warrant  million of cash dividend payments on the preferred stock issuances and general operating expenses 
cash outflows in are expected to include million in dividends for the series a preferred that was issued in december to the extent that the board of directors of the company declares and pays the full quarterly dividends 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees 
commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers 
we had commitments to extend credit of million at december  and million at december  commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many customers do not utilize the total approved commitment amounts  and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not usually represent future cash requirements 
we had million of financial and performance standby letters of credit at december  and million at december  financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment of a specified financial obligation of a customer to a third party 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to make a payment to a specified third party in the event a customer fails to perform under a non financial contractual obligation 
the terms of these financial guarantees generally range from less than one year to five years 
the credit risk involved in issuing these letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we expect most of these letters of credit to expire undrawn  and we expect no significant loss from our obligation under financial guarantees to the extent not already recognized as a liability on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   we had a liability for million for unfunded loan commitments and commitments under standby letters of credit for which we believed funding and loss were probable  compared to million at december

there were covered call options outstanding as of december  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by the board of directors and carried out by the bank s asset liability management committee alco 
alco s objectives are to manage  to the degree prudently possible  our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding and investment security purchase and sale strategies  as well as the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have used various interest rate contracts  including swaps  swaptions  floors  collars and corridors to manage interest rate and market risk 
our asset and liability management and investment policies do not allow the use of derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
therefore  at inception  these contracts are designated as hedges of specific existing assets and liabilities 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  a parallel interest rate rising or declining ramp and uses the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of our existing assets and liabilities  including derivative instruments 
these models are built with the sole objective of measuring the volatility of the embedded interest rate risk as of the balance sheet date and  as such  do not provide for growth or changes in balance sheet composition 
the model computes projected net interest income assuming market rates remain unchanged and then compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing  and relationship between various interest rates 
the impact of embedded options in products  such as callable agencies and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans and callable borrowings  are also considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
alco utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of our net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
net interest income for the next months in a basis points rising rate scenario was calculated to increase million  or  from the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  at december   the projected variance in the rising rate scenario was a decrease of million  or 
these exposures were within our 
table of contents policy guidelines 
no simulation for net interest income at risk in a falling rate scenario was calculated due to the low level of market interest rates at both december  and december  the following table indicates the estimated change in future net interest income from the rates unchanged simulation for the months following the indicated dates  assuming a gradual shift up or down in market rates reflecting a parallel change in rates across the entire yield curve change in future net interest income from rates unchanged simulation december  december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change basis points over one year basis points over one year n a n a n a n a n a not applicable computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including  among other factors  relative levels of market interest rates  product pricing  reinvestment strategies and customer behavior influencing loan and security prepayments and deposit decay and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions that we may take in response to changes in interest rates 
we make no assurances that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   on a consolidated basis  that we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed repricing rates would approximate our actual future experience 

table of contents volumes subject to repricing within days days days years years over years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets short term investments and federal funds sold investment securities and fhlb frb stock loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts certificates of deposit short term borrowings long term borrowings junior subordinated debentures subordinated notes  net total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
more importantly  changes in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels may deviate from those assumed in the calculations in the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  we focus more on earnings at risk simulation modeling than on a gap analysis 
management considers earnings at risk simulation modeling to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
finally  we also monitor interest rate risk from an economic perspective with an economic value of equity analysis 
this measure is used to evaluate long term interest rate risk
