overview we are a medical device company focused on the design  development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring systems for ambulatory use by people with diabetes and for use by healthcare providers in the hospital for the treatment of patients with and without diabetes 
the majority of our product revenue comes from sales of our seven plus ambulatory continuous glucose monitoring system  which we began commercializing in the first quarter of  and our g platinum ambulatory continuous glucose monitoring system  which we began commercializing in the fourth quarter of we also have received ce mark approval for the glucoclear in hospital system  and in partnership with edwards  we initiated a very limited launch of the first generation glucoclear system in europe in and edwards plans to initiate another limited launch in europe of the second generation glucoclear during from inception to  we devoted substantially all of our resources to start up activities  raising capital and research and development  including product design  testing  manufacturing and clinical trials 
since  we have devoted considerable resources to the commercialization of our ambulatory continuous glucose monitoring systems  including the seven plus and g platinum  as well as the continued research and clinical development of our technology platform 
from inception through december   we generated million of product and development grant and other non product revenue  and we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in may from inception through december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our losses to continue as we proceed with our commercialization and research and development activities 
we have financed our operations primarily through offerings of equity securities and convertible debt

in may  we completed a follow on 
table of contents public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
in november  we entered into a loan and security agreement that provides for up to million 
financial operations revenue from inception through december   we generated million in product revenue 
we expect that revenues we generate from the sales of our products will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
between and  we entered into joint development and collaboration agreements with animas  edwards  roche and tandem under which we recognized development grant and other revenue received pursuant to that agreement ratably over the term of the development period 
we recognize development milestones associated with each agreement as revenue upon achievement of each milestone if the milestone is considered substantive 
between and december   we recognized million in development grant and other revenue  which includes milestones and services 
cost of sales product cost of sales includes direct labor and materials costs related to each product sold or produced  including assembly  test labor and scrap  as well as factory overhead supporting our manufacturing operations 
factory overhead includes facilities  material procurement and control  manufacturing engineering  quality assurance  supervision and management 
these costs are primarily salary  fringe benefits  share based compensation  facility expense  supplies and purchased services 
the majority of our costs are currently fixed due to our relatively low production volumes compared to our potential capacity 
all of our manufacturing costs are included in product cost of sales 
development and other cost of sales consists primarily of salaries  fringe  facilities  and supplies directly attributable to our development contracts 
research and development our research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering and research expenses related to our continuous glucose monitoring technology  clinical trials  regulatory expenses  quality assurance programs  materials and products for clinical trials 
research and development expenses are primarily related to employee compensation  including salary  fringe benefits  share based compensation  and temporary employee expenses 
we also incur significant expenses to operate our clinical trials including clinical site reimbursement  clinical trial product and associated travel expenses 
our research and development expenses also include fees for design services  contractors and development materials 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salary  fringe benefits and share based compensation for our executive  financial  sales  marketing and administrative functions 
other significant expenses include trade show expenses  sales samples  insurance  professional fees for our outside legal counsel and independent auditors  litigation expenses and consulting expenses 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to december  revenue  cost of sales and gross profit product revenues increased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  based primarily on increased sales volume of our durable systems and disposable sensors  due in part to the launch of the g platinum system in the fourth quarter of product cost of sales increased million to million for the twelve months 
table of contents ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the product gross profit of million for the twelve months ended december  increased million compared to million for the same period in  primarily due to increased revenue 
development grant and other revenues decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  development and other cost of sales increased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in development grant and other revenues during the twelve months ended december  was due to the million milestone payment received from animas for ce mark approval in june and by extended revenue recognition timelines related to longer than expected development and regulatory review timelines under our collaboration arrangements with edwards 
the increase in costs associated with development was primarily due to additional development obligations during the year with respect to our collaboration arrangements 
research and development 
research and development expense increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased development efforts for our future generation ambulatory products and by decreased activity with respect to our development and collaboration agreements 
major elements of increased research and development costs include million in additional salaries  bonus  and payroll related costs  million in additional share based compensation and million in additional consulting costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher selling  marketing  and information technology costs to support revenue growth and the continued commercialization of our products 
major elements of increased selling  general  and administrative expenses include million in higher salaries  bonus  and payroll related costs  million in higher share based compensation  and million in higher commissions 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was million for each of the twelve months ended december  and interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the loan and security agreement entered into in november income tax benefit 
income tax benefit was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to none for the twelve months ended december  the increase in income tax benefit was primarily due to the acquisition of sweetspot and the release of the valuation allowance against some of our deferred tax assets 
fiscal year ended december  compared to december  revenue  cost of sales and gross profit product revenues increased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  based primarily on increased sales volume of our durable systems and disposable sensors  and higher average per unit selling prices 
product cost of sales increased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increased product cost of sales associated with additional product sales was offset primarily by increased manufacturing absorption for the twelve months 
table of contents ended december  as compared to the same period in the product gross profit of million for the twelve months ended december  increased million compared to million for the same period in  primarily due to increased revenue and improved manufacturing absorption 
development grant and other revenues increased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  development and other cost of sales decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in development grant and other revenues during the twelve months ended december  was due to additional services performed and the million milestone payment received from animas for ce mark approval  and was partially offset by extended development and regulatory review timelines under our collaboration arrangements with edwards and animas 
the decrease in costs associated with development was primarily due to fewer development obligations during the year with respect to our collaboration arrangements 
research and development 
research and development expense increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to increased development efforts for our future generation ambulatory products and by decreased activity with respect to our development and collaboration agreements 
major elements of increased research and development costs include million in additional consulting costs  million in additional salaries  bonus  and payroll related costs  and million in additional share based compensation 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher selling  customer operations  and information technology costs to support revenue growth and the continued commercialization of our products 
major elements of increased selling  general  and administrative expenses include million in higher salaries  bonus  and payroll related costs  million in higher share based compensation  and million in higher facility costs 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was million for each of the twelve months ended december  and interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to  for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the conversion of all of the outstanding convertible notes in loss on debt extinguishment upon conversion of convertible debt for the twelve months ended december   we completed exchanges with prior holders of our issued and outstanding notes  under which we issued an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock  par value per share  in exchange for million in aggregate principal amount of the notes previously held by the exchanging holders 
we incurred a loss on the extinguishment of the notes in the amount of million for the twelve months ended december   which includes the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the notes on the conversion date  other consideration given to note holders to induce early conversion and transaction costs incurred with third parties  other than the investors  to settle the conversion of the notes 
liquidity and capital resources we are in the early commercialization stage and have incurred losses since our inception in may as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and had working capital of 
table of contents million 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled million  excluding million in restricted cash 
we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of equity and debt securities and our bank loans 
in january  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
in november  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
in may  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
in november  we entered into a loan and security agreement that provides for up to million 
net cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to million in higher net loss  offset by million in higher non cash charges primarily comprised of share based compensation and depreciation and amortization 
higher non cash charges were offset by a one time non cash tax benefit of million 
also included in net loss were million of non cash charges for excess and obsolete inventory and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing equipment related to the approval and launch of our next generation g platinum system 
net cash provided by investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million used in investing activities for the same period of the increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to million decrease in cash used to purchase available for sale marketable securities and by million increase in proceeds from the maturity of available for sale marketable securities for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in for the twelve months ended december   we invested million in equipment to support manufacturing improvements compared to million during the same period in net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the same period of the decrease was primarily due to the approximately million in net proceeds generated by the sale of common stock for the twelve months ending december  compared to approximately million in the same period of  offset by net proceeds of million from the loan and security agreement entered into during the twelve months ending december  compared to none in the same period of operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses as we incur expenses to continue to expand the commercialization of our approved products  develop additional continuous glucose monitoring products  and expand our marketing  manufacturing and corporate infrastructure 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term marketable securities balances  and projected cash contributions from existing partnership arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements with respect to the continued scale up of our commercialization activities  research and development activities  including clinical trials  the expansion of our marketing  manufacturing and corporate infrastructure  and to meet our other anticipated cash needs through at least december  if our available cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we develop additional products  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining additional cash contributions from future partnership arrangements 
our ability to transition to attaining 
table of contents profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure 
if events or circumstances occur such that we do not meet our operating plan as expected  or if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce planned increases in compensation related expenses or other operating expenses related to research  development  and commercialization activities  which could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of continuous glucose monitoring technologies  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the revenue generated by sales of our approved products and other future products  the expenses we incur in manufacturing  developing  selling and marketing our products  the quality levels of our products and services  the third party reimbursement of our products for our customers  our ability to efficiently scale our manufacturing operations to meet demand for our current and any future products  the costs  timing and risks of delays of additional regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  including  but not limited to  defending the patent infringement lawsuit filed against us by abbott  the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other development activities  the success of our research and development efforts  the emergence of competing or complementary technological developments  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  and the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies 
on march   we consummated our acquisition of sweetspot 
through our acquisition of sweetspot  we have a software platform that enables our customers to aggregate and analyze data from diabetes devices and to share it with their healthcare providers 
in november  sweetspot received k clearance from the fda to market to clinics a data management service  which helps healthcare providers and patients see  understand and use blood glucose meter data to diagnose and manage diabetes 
sweetspot s data transfer service is registered with the fda as a mdds and allows researchers to control the transfer of data from patient diabetes devices to research tools and databases according to their own research workflows 
sweetspot s software provides an advanced cloud based platform for uploading  processing and delivering health data and transforms raw output from patient medical devices into useful information for healthcare providers  patients and researchers 
the acquisition could increase our cost structure or divert management s attention more than anticipated 
contractual obligations in november  we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement that provides for i a million revolving line of credit and ii a total term loan up to million  in both cases  to be used for general corporate purposes 
the borrowings under the loan agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets with a negative pledge on our intellectual property 
the revolving line of credit is an interest only financing that bears an interest rate equal to the prime rate plus and requires repayment of principal at the maturity date of november per the loan agreement  million 
table of contents was advanced under the term loan at the funding date  excluding issuance costs and fees withheld  and up to million in additional funds will be available upon our request from june  to september  the term loan bears a fixed interest rate equal to the three year treasury rate at the time of advance plus and requires payment of interest only for the first year and amortized payments of interest and principal thereafter through the maturity date of november in april  we entered into an office lease agreement for facilities located in san diego  california 
in connection with the lease  we entered into a million letter of credit to secure future payments under the lease and paid a security deposit in the amount of million in april in august  we entered into a first amendment to office lease the lease amendment with respect to facilities in the buildings at sequence drive and sequence drive  each in san diego  california the buildings 
under the lease amendment  we have leased approximately  square feet of space in the buildings 
the lease term for the buildings extends through november and we have an option to renew the lease upon the expiration of the initial term for an additional five years 
in september  our subsidiary in sweden entered into a three year lease for a small shared office space  which was renewed for a three year term and has a quarterly adjustment clause for rent to increase or decrease in proportion to changes in consumer prices 
in july  our subsidiary sweetspot entered into a five year lease for a small office space in a multi tenant commercial building 
excluding real estate taxes and operating costs  we are required to make total future monthly payments for all of our real estate obligations for the period from january through august totaling million 
we are party to various purchase arrangements related to components used in production and research and development activities 
as of december   we had purchase commitments with certain vendors totaling approximately million due within one year 
there are no material purchase commitments due beyond one year 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases long term debt purchase commitments total off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we sell durable systems and disposable units through a direct sales force in the united states as well as through distribution arrangements in the united states  israel  australia  new zealand  and in portions of europe 
components are individually priced and can be purchased separately or together 
we receive payment directly from customers who use our products  as well as from distributors  organizations and third party payors 
the seven plus and g platinum durable systems include a transmitter  a receiver  a power cord  data management software and a usb cable 
disposable sensors for use with the seven plus and g platinum systems are sold separately in packages of four 
the initial durable system price for each of the seven plus and g platinum is not dependent upon the purchase of any amount of disposable sensors 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue on product sales is generally recognized upon shipment  which is when title and the risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and there are no other post shipment obligations 
with respect to customers who directly pay for the products  the products are generally paid for at the time of shipment using a customer s credit card and do not include customer acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenue from contracted insurance payors based on the contracted rate 
for non contracted insurance payors  we obtain a prior authorization from the payor and recognize revenue based on the agreed upon price  estimated collectible amount and historical experience 
we also receive a prescription or statement of medical necessity and  for insurance reimbursement customers  an assignment of benefits prior to shipment 
we provide a day money back guarantee program whereby customers who purchase the seven plus and g platinum durable systems and a package of four disposable sensors may return the seven plus and g platinum durable system for any reason within thirty days of purchase and receive a full refund of their purchase price 
at december  and  we maintained a reserve balance of  and  respectively  relating to this program 
we accrue for estimated returns  refunds and rebates by reducing revenues and establishing a liability account at the time of shipment based on historical experience 
we have entered into a distribution agreement with edgepark  as amended on march   as well as agreements with other distributors that allow the distributors to sell our durable systems and disposable units 
revenue on product sales to distributors is generally recognized at the time of shipment  which is when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the distributor and there are no other post shipment obligations 
revenue is recognized based on contracted prices and invoices are either paid by check following the issuance of a purchase order or letter of credit  or they are paid by wire at the time of placing the order 
terms of distributor orders are generally freight on board fob shipping point free carrier fca shipping point for international orders 
distributors do not have rights of return per their distribution agreement outside of our standard warranty 
our distributors typically have a limited time frame to notify us of any missing  damaged  defective or non conforming products 
for any such products  we shall either  at our option  replace the portion of defective or non conforming product at no additional cost to the distributor or cancel the order and refund any portion of the price paid to us at that time for the sale in question 
we have no intention of refunding or unwinding a prior sale and view any potential product non conformity solely as a warranty issue 
we shipped product directly to certain distributors customers and recognized million  million and million in revenue  which represents  and of our total revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
with respect to other distributors which stock inventory of our product and fulfill orders from their inventory  we shipped product to these distributors and recognized 
table of contents million  million and million in revenue from these arrangements  which represents  and of our total revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
we monitor shipments to  and on hand inventory levels of  these distributors  and at december  these distributors had limited amounts of our product in their inventory 
from through  we entered into collaborative license and development arrangements with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of products utilizing our technologies 
the terms of these agreements obligate us to multiple deliverables for example  license rights  provision of research and development services  and manufacture of clinical materials in exchange for our right to receive various forms of consideration including non refundable license fees  funding of research and development activities  payments based upon achievement of development milestones and royalties in the form of a designated percentage of product sales or profits 
with the exception of royalties  these types of consideration are classified as development grant and other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and are generally recognized over the service period except for substantive milestone payments  which are generally recognized when the milestone is achieved 
in determining whether each milestone is substantive  we considered whether the consideration earned by achieving the milestone should i be commensurate with either a our performance to achieve the milestone or b the enhancement of value of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  ii relate solely to past performance and iii be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
we recognize royalties in the period in which we obtain the royalty report  which is necessary to determine the amount of royalties we are entitled to receive 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license  development and other multiple element service arrangements are analyzed to determine how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting  or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
for transactions containing multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified after january   we consider deliverables as separate units of accounting and recognize deliverables as revenue upon delivery only if i the deliverable has standalone value and ii if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is probable and substantially controlled by us 
we allocate consideration to the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method  in which allocation of consideration is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe  or if vsoe or tpe is not available  management s best estimate of a standalone selling price for elements 
for transactions containing multiple element arrangements entered into prior to january   we considered deliverables as separate units of accounting and recognized deliverables as revenue upon delivery only if i the deliverable had standalone value  ii if the arrangement included a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s was probable and substantially controlled by us  and iii the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined 
in those instances when objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for the undelivered items but not for the delivered items  the residual method was used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of arrangement consideration allocated to the delivered items equaled the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
if we were unable to establish standalone value for delivered items or when fair value of undelivered items had not been established  revenue was deferred until all elements were delivered and services had been performed  or until fair value could objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
we use judgment in estimating the value allocable to the deliverables in an agreement based on our estimate of the fair value or relative selling price attributable to the related deliverables 
arrangement consideration is 
table of contents typically recognized as product revenue or development grant and other revenue 
for arrangements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  total payments under the arrangement are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
we review the estimated period of our performance obligations on a periodic basis and update the recognition period as appropriate 
the cumulative amount of revenue earned is limited to the cumulative amount of payments received as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential 
revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance 
deferred revenue amounts are classified as current liabilities to the extent that revenue is expected to be recognized within one year 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  non employee directors  and consultants including employee stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
share based compensation expense for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options and restricted stock units that is expected to be recognized as a component of our operating expenses through we issued performance restricted stock units the performance awards in connection with our acquisition of sweetspot 
the performance targets for these performance awards are earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for fiscal years and we begin to recognize expense for the performance awards over the expected service period when it is probable that the ebitda targets will be met 
at december   we had million of unrecognized share based compensation expense related to the performance awards 
compensation costs will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods as share based compensation expense using the straight line single option method in our consolidated statement of operations 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model as our method of valuation for stock options granted and we use the grant date fair value of our common stock for valuing restricted stock unit awards 
our determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  for estimated excess  obsolete and potential scrapped inventories 
factors influencing these adjustments include inventories on hand and on order compared to estimated future usage and sales for existing and new products  as well as judgments regarding quality control testing data  and assumptions about the likelihood of scrap and obsolescence 
once written down the adjustments are considered 
table of contents permanent and are not reversed until the related inventory is sold or disposed 
we utilize a standard cost system to track inventories on a part by part basis that approximates first in  first out 
if necessary  adjustments are made to the standard materials  standard labor and standard overhead costs to approximate actual labor and actual overhead costs 
we recorded charges of million for the twelve months ended december  related to the excess and obsolescence of hardware due to the approval and launch of our next generation g platinum system 
warranty accrual we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of shipment 
we estimate warranty accruals by analyzing the timing  cost and amount of returned product 
we evaluate assumptions and historical warranty experience on at least a quarterly basis to determine the continued appropriateness of such assumptions 
bonus accrual for the bonus plan  the compensation committee authorized an amount of up to of salary and wages for non sales employees to be awarded from the pool based on the weighted average achievement measured against certain objectives 
as various targets were met  we incurred million in bonus compensation for the year ended december  income taxes in july  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  the authoritative guidance provides detail on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of the authoritative guidance 
we file income tax returns in the united states and in various state jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
due to net operating losses incurred  our income tax returns from inception to date are subject to examination by taxing authorities 
our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
as of december   we had no interest or penalties accrued for uncertain tax positions 
short term marketable securities we have classified our short term investments as available for sale and carry them at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  reported as comprehensive loss 
realized gains and losses are calculated on the specific identification method and recorded as interest income 
we do not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases  which may be maturity 
fair value measurements we base the fair value of our level financial instruments that are in active markets using quoted market prices for identical instruments 
our level financial instruments include money market funds and certificates of deposit 
we obtain the fair value of our level financial instruments  which are not in active markets  from a primary professional pricing source using quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments  rather than direct observations of quoted prices in active markets 
fair value obtained from this professional pricing 
table of contents source can also be based on pricing models whereby all significant observable inputs  including maturity dates  issue dates  settlement date  benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issue spreads  benchmark securities  bids  offers or other market related data  are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset 
we validate the quoted market prices provided by our primary pricing service by comparing the fair values of our level investment portfolio balance provided by our primary pricing service against the fair values of our level investment portfolio balance provided by our investment managers 
certain contingent consideration liabilities are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because they use unobservable inputs 
for those liabilities  fair value is determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model  the significant inputs which are not observable in the market 
the book values of cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values due to the short term nature of these instruments
