the date of this discussion is march  unless otherwise noted  tabular amounts are in thousands of us dollars 
oil and gas production  revenue  reserves and related measures are presented net of royalty payments to governments 
business environment the company s core operations are in canada and ecuador 
canada offers a relatively stable business environment in which to operate due to established infrastructure and political stability 
however the oil and gas sector currently faces challenges including transportation of oil and gas products to international markets and the associated environmental impact of these projects 
the company believes that the long term demand for oil and gas will remain strong and that further development  particularly in the heavy oil segment  will be required in order to meet this anticipated demand 
ecuador regulates various aspects of foreign company operations and has had periods of political instability in the past 
with the recent election of the incumbent ecuadorian president  the company anticipates the government s future policy toward foreign investment in oil and gas operations will remain consistent and one in which the company can operate 
the development of the company s oil and gas and htl operations are capital intensive 
in the past  ivanhoe has used external sources of funding such as public and private equity and debt markets 
the company is impacted by industry influences including commodity prices and larger macro economic factors that have had investors recently rotating out of commodity investments and may affect the company s ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms

the company used a portion of the proceeds to extinguish its short term debt and the remaining proceeds will be used within the company s remaining business 
net loss from continuing operations in was million  an increase of million compared to million in the increase is mainly attributable to million in higher exploration and evaluation expenses and an million lower unrealized derivative gain in capital expenditures amounted to million in in ecuador  million in capital expenditures were used to drill a  foot well  ip  into the pre cretaceous zone in the southern portion of the block to test the formations in this area 
the well confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons in the hollin and napo formations and evaluated the potential of the deeper  pre cretaceous structures 
while hydrocarbons were found in the hollin and napo formations  the reservoir in the immediate vicinity of the well was not suitable for commercial exploitation

operating costs operating costs in the technology development segment are incurred at the company s feedstock test facility ftf at the southwest research institute in san antonio  texas and mainly consist of labor and materials 
ftf operating costs in were million  relatively unchanged from the operating costs of million 
ftf operating costs of million in were million higher than the million in costs incurred in due to activities associated with assay and analyses related to the successful upgrading of the heavy oil recovered from the pungarayacu ip b well in ecuador and planned maintenance costs associated with enhancements implemented at the ftf in the second quarter of general and administrative g a expenses mainly consist of staff  office and legal and other contract services costs 
the company incurred g a expenses of million in  a decrease of million compared to costs of million in g a expenses were lower in due to lower staff and legal and other contract services costs 
staff costs decreased million compared to because the formalization of the company s compensation program in resulted in the company accruing two years of short term incentive costs for that year  also benefitted from lower share based payment expense due to higher employee turnover in legal and other contract services costs decreased million from mainly due to the conclusion of the grynberg lawsuit and recovery of the company s costs as a result of a favorable ruling in that case 
g a costs also decreased million from mainly due to less allocated shared services activity and lower professional service fees relating to audit and financing activities 
g a expenses were million in  an increase of million compared to g a expenses of million in the higher g a costs in mainly result from increased legal costs of million  in connection with proceedings further described in part i  item of this form k  as well as financing costs associated with the cdn million convertible unsecured subordinated debentures convertible debentures issued in the second quarter of and contract engineering costs of million related to ivanhoe s htl technology to investigate new applications 
the higher costs in were partially offset by lower charitable contributions  in  the company committed to a million donation to flood victims in ecuador 
exploration and evaluation costs of exploring for  and evaluating  oil and gas properties are initially capitalized as intangible exploration and evaluation e e assets and charged to e e expense only if sufficient reserves cannot be established or once the costs are determined to have no future value 
e e expense in was million  million higher than e e expense of million in the ip exploratory well in the southern part of block in ecuador led to the discovery of non commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and the company expensed million in related costs in in addition  the company also expensed million in capital costs in relating to the second mongolian well drilled in independent laboratory tests finalized in september on the drill cuttings from mongolia indicated that there is a high probability that mobile oil in the well is limited 
other e e costs of million were expensed in the second quarter of e e expense in was million  a decrease of million from an e e expense of million in drilling costs of million were expensed in connection with the exploration well in mongolia that was plugged and abandoned 
in addition  it was determined that million of expenditures related to the seismic program in ecuador would have limited future value and were therefore charged to e e expense 
e e expense in related to the drilling of two appraisal wells on block in ecuador 
the first appraisal well  ip  encountered cementing and completion problems prior to steam injection operations and testing was suspended without recovering oil resulting in million of drilling and testing costs expensed in 
table of contents depreciation depreciation expense is primarily charges for the amortization of capitalized costs of the ftf but also includes furniture and equipment depreciation 
depreciation expense in was million  unchanged from depreciation expense in was million  an increase of million compared to million in the increase is driven by a lower than normal depreciation amount that resulted from commercial demonstration facility salvage costs coming in lower than previously recorded amounts 
foreign currency exchange the gain or loss on foreign currency exchange results from the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the company s functional currency  the us dollar  at each period end and from the settlement of the company s payables denominated in foreign currencies 
the company incurred a million loss on foreign currency exchange in compared to a million gain in the loss on foreign exchange in is mainly due to the revaluation of the canadian denominated convertible debentures as the canadian dollar strengthened near the end of compared to the closing exchange rate resulting in a higher translated debt in the company incurred a smaller net foreign exchange gain of million in in comparison to million from the prior year 
the canadian dollar was stronger than the us dollar in the first nine months of  subsequently weakening in the fourth quarter of net foreign exchange gains incurred on the translation of the company s canadian dollar denominated cash  debt and payables in the first three quarters of were partially offset by net foreign exchange losses in the fourth quarter 
in the first quarter of  the company incurred a net foreign exchange gain on the translation of its canadian dollar cash raised in the cdn million private placement when the canadian dollar strengthened against the us dollar  which was partially offset by a net foreign exchange loss incurred in the second quarter of when the canadian dollar weakened 
in the second half of  additional foreign exchange gains were incurred on the translation of monetary items as the canadian dollar continued to strengthen relative to the us dollar 
derivative instruments the gain on derivative instruments results from accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments through earnings 
in  the company valued the convertible component of the convertible debentures at approximately million compared to million in the lower valuation  which resulted in an unrealized gain of million in  was a result of lower company share prices in which the company s uses as an input in estimating the fair value of the derivative 
in  the unrealized gain on derivative instruments was million compared to million in an unrealized gain on the convertible component of the convertible debentures totaled million and a combination of the expiry and revaluation of the company s purchase warrants resulted in a gain of million 
additionally  a gain of million was recognized on the revaluation of the convertible portion of the cdn million convertible promissory note issued to talisman convertible note 
the revaluation of an option granted to a private investor in january to acquire an equity interest in one of the company s subsidiaries created a loss of million in the current year 
the million unrealized gain recorded in stemmed from a million and million gain  respectively  on the revaluation of the purchase warrants and the convertible note 
finance finance expense consists of interest expense and the unwinding of the discount rate for decommissioning obligations 
finance expense in was million  an increase of million compared to million in the increase is due to higher debt in which the company used to fund operations while closing the asset dispositions as well as a lower allocation of interest to capital expenditures as debt funding near the last half of was used more for ongoing operations than capital projects 

table of contents finance expense in was million and did not change materially compared to loss on debt repayment the company classified its short term debt as a financial liability measured at amortized cost which allows for transaction costs to be amortized over the life of the debt instrument 
in december  subsequent to the closing of the china asset dispositions  the company used a portion of the proceeds to repay its short term debt earlier than the maturity date of the debt 
this repayment resulted in the remaining deferred transaction costs of the debt instruments being charged through earnings at the time repayment was made 
in  these costs amounted to million 
gain on derecognition of long term provision as part of the merger agreement with ensyn  the company assumed a million contingent obligation 
in the third quarter of  the company determined  based on recent events and clarification of contract terms  that satisfaction of the specific contractual contingencies was unlikely and the liability was derecognized 
provision for income taxes the company recorded a deferred tax recovery of million in compared to a recovery of million in the million decrease in recovery is mainly due to a reduction in the valuation allowance in in respect of certain us operating losses that were determined to be more likely than not to be realized as well as a reduction in net operating losses from lower expenses in the company recorded a deferred tax recovery of million in compared to a recovery of million in the million increase in the recovery in was mainly due to a reduction in the valuation allowance previously mentioned as well as an increase in us operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commitments the following information about our contractual obligations and other commitments summarizes certain liquidity and capital resource requirements 
the information presented in the table below does not include planned  but not legally committed  capital expenditures or obligations that are discretionary and or being performed under contracts which are cancelable with a day notification period 
total after long term debt interest on long term debt decommissioning obligations leases total long term debt is denominated in canadian dollars and has been translated to us dollars at an exchange rate of approximately cad usd 
represents undiscounted decommissioning obligations after inflation 
the discounted value of these estimated obligations million is provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
long term debt and interest as described in the financial statements  the company issued cdn million of convertible debentures maturing on june  the convertible debentures bear interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually on the last day of june and december of each year  commencing on december  decommissioning provisions the company is required to remedy the effect of our activities on the environment at our operating sites by dismantling and removing production facilities and remediating any damage caused 
at december   ivanhoe estimated the total undiscounted  inflated cost to settle its decommissioning obligations in canada  for the ftf in the us and in ecuador was million 
these costs are expected to be incurred in  and  respectively 

table of contents leases the company has long term leases for office space and vehicles  which expire between and other should ivanhoe receive government and other approvals necessary to develop the northern border of one of the tamarack project leases  the company will be required to make a cash payment to talisman of up to cdn million  as a conditional  final payment for the purchase transaction 
from time to time  ivanhoe enters into consulting agreements whereby a success fee may be payable if and when either a definitive agreement is signed or certain other contractual milestones are met 
under the agreements  the consultant may receive cash  common shares  stock options or some combination thereof 
similarly  agreements entered into by the company may contain cancellation fees or liquidated damages provisions for early termination 
these fees are not considered to be material 
the company may provide indemnities to third parties  in the ordinary course of business  that are customary in certain commercial transactions  such as purchase and sale agreements 
the terms of these indemnities will vary based upon the contract  the nature of which prevents ivanhoe from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amounts that may be required to be paid 
the company s management is of the opinion that any resulting settlements relating to indemnities are not likely to be material 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to legal proceedings being brought against it 
while the final outcome of these proceedings is uncertain  the company believes that these proceedings  in the aggregate  are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial position or earnings 
sources and uses of cash the company s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities ivanhoe s existing financial resources are insufficient to fund the future capital expenditures necessary to advance the development of our existing projects 
the company intends to use its working capital to meet its commitments 
the company has engaged in discussions with a third party respecting the possibility of jointly investing and participating in the development and operation of block during the course of these discussions  the parties have developed a framework of commercial terms intended to form the basis for separate discussions with the government of ecuador 
the ultimate objective of discussions with the government is the establishment of mutually acceptable terms and conditions allowing for the formation of a consortium between the company and the third party to jointly participate in block the formation of the consortium is contingent upon the successful negotiation of definitive and legally binding agreements that reflect the achievement of this objective 
there is no assurance that this objective can be achieved  or achieved in a timely manner 
additional sources of funding will be required to grow the company s major projects and fully develop its oil and gas properties 
historically  ivanhoe has used external sources of funding such as public and private equity and debt markets 
however  there is no assurance that these sources of funding will be available to the company in the future or available on acceptable terms  and any future equity issuances may be dilutive to current investors 
if ivanhoe cannot secure additional financing  the company may have to delay its capital programs and forfeit or dilute its rights in existing oil and gas property interests 
operating activities cash used in operating activities in was million  an increase of million from million of cash used in operating activities in the increase was mainly due to higher interest costs in from financing operations with a higher amount of debt than the prior year and was partially offset by lower general and administrative costs 
cash used in operating activities in was million  million lower than million used in operations in as growth in revenue exceeded increases in operating costs and g a expenses

capital structure as at december long term debt shareholders equity total capital at december   ivanhoe s market capitalization was less than the carrying value of the company s assets 
management does not consider this to be determinative that an impairment exists as there are factors which should be considered when interpreting ivanhoe s recent trading price  such as industry influences including commodity prices and larger macro economic factors that have had investors recently rotating out of commodity investments 
management does not believe the full value of the company s oil and gas assets or htl technology is reflected in ivanhoe s current stock price 
the company received a notification from the listing qualifications department of the nasdaq notifying the company that the company did not meet the minimum bid price requirements set forth in the nasdaq listing rules 
the company could regain compliance if at any time prior to november  the closing bid price of the ivanhoe s common stock was at least for a minimum of consecutive business days 
on november   the company applied to the nasdaq for an additional compliance period of days which was granted and will expire on may the company intends to seek approval of its shareholders to effect a reverse stock split of its common shares in order to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in the nasdaq listing rules 
reducing the number of issued and outstanding common shares through a common share consolidation is intended  absent other factors  to increase the per share market price of the common shares 
however  the market price of the common shares will also be affected by the company s financial and operational results  its financial position  including its liquidity and capital resources  the development of its projects  industry conditions  the market s perception of the company s business and other factors  which are unrelated to the number of common shares outstanding 
while a reverse stock split will result in an initial trading price above the nasdaq minimum bid price  the market considerations mentioned above will be the ultimate arbiter of the company s share price 
the ability of the company to remain above the minimum bid price and maintain a nasdaq listing will be determined by the markets 

table of contents critical accounting principles and estimates the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with ifrs as issued by the iasb 
the financial statements are not subject to qualification relating to the application of ifrs as issued by the iasb 
a detailed summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note to the financial statements 
some of these policies involve critical accounting estimates as they require the company to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following section discusses critical accounting estimates and assumptions and how they affect the amounts reported in the company s financial statements 
intangible e e assets management must determine if intangible e e assets  which have not yet resulted in the discovery of proved reserves  should continue to be capitalized or charged to e e expense 
when making this determination  ivanhoe considers factors such as the company s drilling results  planned exploration and development activities  the financial capacity of the company to further develop the property  the ability to use the company s htl technology in certain projects  lease expiries  market conditions and technical recommendations from its exploration staff 
although the company believes its estimates are reasonable and consistent with current conditions  internal planning and expected future operations  such estimates are subject to significant uncertainties and judgments 
ivanhoe cannot predict if an event that triggers impairment will occur  when it will occur  or how it will affect the reported asset amounts 
impairment property  plant and equipment pp e prior to the sale of its producing oil and gas properties in  the company periodically assessed its oil and gas assets  or groups of assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated the carrying value may not be recoverable 
among other things  an impairment may be triggered by falling oil and gas prices  a significant negative revision to reserve estimates  the inability to use the company s htl technology in certain projects  changes in capital costs or the inability to raise sufficient financial resources to further develop the property 
cash flow estimates for the company s impairment assessments require significant assumptions about future prices and costs  production  reserves volumes and discount rates  as well as potential benefits from the application of its htl technology 
given the significant assumptions required and the likelihood that actual conditions will differ  the assessment of impairment of oil and gas assets was considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
intangible technology assets the company s intangible technology assets consist of an exclusive  irrevocable license to deploy its htl technology 
ivanhoe annually reviews the technology assets  and the associated ftf assets recorded within pp e  for impairment or if an adverse event or change occurs 
indicators of adverse events could include htl patent expiries  advancements of new technologies or the inability to successfully commercialize the htl technology 
the intangible asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it requires ivanhoe to make assumptions about competitive technological developments  the successful commercialization of its htl technology and future cash flows from the htl technology 
ivanhoe cannot predict if an event that triggers impairment will occur  when it will occur  or how it will affect the reported asset amounts 
although the company believes its estimates are reasonable and consistent with current conditions  internal planning and expected future operations  such estimates are subject to significant uncertainties and judgments 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of reserves is inherently uncertain and complex 
it requires significant judgments and decisions based on available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change 
such revisions could be upwards or downwards 
for details on our reserve estimation process  refer to the section titled reserves  production and related information in items and of this annual report 
reserve estimates have a material impact on the company s impairment evaluations  which in turn have a material impact on earnings 

table of contents option pricing model the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and equity settled restricted share units rsus on the date of grant 
determining the fair value of stock based awards on the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the award  the expected volatility of the company s common shares and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required to estimate the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited 
changes in assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value  and therefore  the existing models do not necessarily provide precise measures of fair value 
convertible debentures on june   the company issued cdn million of convertible debentures 
the canadian dollar denominated debt is considered to contain an embedded derivative since the functional currency of the company is the us dollar 
as a result  the convertible debentures were bifurcated into debt and the equity conversion option  which was recognized at fair value using the black scholes valuation method 
changes in the fair value of the equity conversion option are recorded in earnings  therefore the valuation of the equity conversion option is a critical accounting estimate 
the black scholes valuation method requires the input of highly subjective assumptions regarding expected volatility of the company s share price and the risk free interest rate 
if the volatility used to fair value the equity conversion component at december  decreased by  the fair value of the equity conversion option would decrease by million 
if volatility increased by  the fair value of the equity conversion option would increase by million 
convertible note in connection with the acquisition of the tamarack leases in july from talisman  the company issued a cdn million convertible note 
the canadian dollar denominated debt was considered to contain an embedded derivative since the functional currency of the company is the us dollar 
as a result  the convertible note was bifurcated into debt and the equity conversion option  which was recognized at fair value using the black scholes valuation method 
changes in the fair value of the equity conversion option were recorded in earnings  and as a result  the valuation of the equity conversion option was a critical accounting estimate prior to the maturity of the convertible note on july  deferred income taxes ivanhoe operates in a specialized industry and in several tax jurisdictions 
as a result  the company s income is subject to various rates of taxation 
the breadth of the company s operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the taxes that the company will ultimately pay 
the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxation authorities in various jurisdictions  uncertain tax positions and resolution of disputes arising from federal  provincial  state and local tax audits 
the deferred income tax liability is a critical accounting estimate because it requires ivanhoe to make assumptions about the resolution of these uncertainties and the associated final taxes may result in adjustments to the company s tax assets and tax liabilities 
new accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements the company has reviewed new and revised accounting pronouncements listed below  that have been issued  but are not yet effective 
there are no other standards or interpretations issued  but not yet adopted  that are anticipated to have a material effect on the reported loss or net assets of the company 
ifrs financial instruments ifrs the first phase of ifrs was issued in november and is intended to replace ias  financial instruments recognition and measurement ias 
ifrs uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at amortized cost or fair value  as opposed to the multiple rules in ias the approach is based on how an entity manages its financial instruments given its business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets 
the standard also requires a single impairment method to be used  replacing the multiple impairment methods in ias ifrs is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after january  the full impact of this standard will not be known until the phases addressing hedging and impairments have been completed 

table of contents ifrs consolidated financial statements ifrs ifrs was issued in may and sets a single basis for consolidation  that being control of an entity

the company does not anticipate any changes to the consolidated financial statements as a result of this standard 
ifrs disclosure of interests in other entities ifrs ifrs  issued in may  establishes a single set of disclosure objectives  and requires minimum disclosures designed to meet those objectives  regarding interests in subsidiaries  joint arrangements  associates or unconsolidated structured entities 
ifrs is intended to combine the disclosure requirements on interests in other entities currently located throughout different standards 
this standard is effective for reporting periods on or after january   with earlier adoption permitted 
the company does not anticipate significant changes to its disclosure of interests in other entities as a result of this standard 
ifrs fair value measurements ifrs ifrs  issued in may  defines fair value  sets out a single ifrs framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements

off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed in varying degrees to normal market risks inherent in the oil and gas industry  including foreign currency exchange rate risk  credit risk and liquidity risk 
we recognize these risks and manage our operations to minimize our exposures to the extent practicable 
foreign currency exchange rate risk ivanhoe is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of incurring capital expenditures and operating costs in currencies other than the us dollar 
a substantial portion of our activities are transacted in or referenced to us dollars  including capital spending in ecuador and ongoing ftf operations 
some of the canada exploration activities are funded in canadian dollars and the convertible debentures were issued in canadian dollars in the company did not enter into any foreign currency derivatives in  nor do we anticipate using foreign currency derivatives in to help reduce the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  it seeks to hold assets and liabilities denominated in the same currency when appropriate 

table of contents the following table shows the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk on its net loss and comprehensive loss for  assuming reasonably possible changes in the relevant foreign currency 
this analysis assumes all other variables remain constant 
increase decrease in net loss and comprehensive loss increase or weakening decrease or strengthening canadian dollar credit risk ivanhoe is exposed to credit risk with respect to its cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  accounts receivable  note receivable and long term receivables 
the company s maximum exposure to credit risk at december  is represented by the carrying amount of these non derivative financial assets 
the company believes its exposure to credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents  as well as restricted cash  is minimal due to the quality of the financial institutions where the funds are held and the nature of the deposit instruments 
long term value added tax receivable from the ecuadorian government will be recoverable upon commencement of commercial operations
