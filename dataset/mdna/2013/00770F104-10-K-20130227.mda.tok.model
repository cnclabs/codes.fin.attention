results of operations compared to dollars in thousands increase decrease revenues gross profit gross profit margin n a bp operating expenses reversal of earnout acquisition related expenses restructuring charges   n m operating income operating margin n a bp net income consolidated net income increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily the result of a million  or  improvement in our energy and mining operating income due to growth in our coating and cathodic protection operations 
additionally  our north american water and wastewater segment increased operating income by million  or  from improved project management and the steps we took during the second half of to improve efficiencies 
also contributing to the increase in net income was a million decrease in acquisition related expenses in along with the absence of million of restructuring and million of debt restructuring costs 
during  our financial results included a full year of contributions from fyfe na  days of contributions from fyfe la  days of contributions from fyfe asia  and the results of our acquisitions of crts and hockway 
these acquisitions contributed million in operating income during the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of million in the year ended december  the year ended december  included reversals of million  million and million of the earnouts related to crts  hockway and fyfe la  respectively  due to the current year results being below the stated threshold amounts within the respective purchase agreements 
the largest earnout reversal was with crts from a reduction in scope of the wasit project and multiple scheduling delays to the first half of  a delay of ten months from the originally expected commencement date 
additionally  included acquisition related costs of million  restructuring costs associated with a reduction in workforce of million  reversal of million of the earnout related to the acquisition of bayou and expenses associated with an expanded credit facility  which included a million make whole payment for the redemption of our outstanding senior notes and a million write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
revenues during increased by million  or  from significant growth in our energy and mining segment where revenues increased primarily due to our industrial linings operations in north america and internationally 
the revenue also included million of additional revenue from a full year of operations from our acquisitions of crts  hockway and fyfe na and our acquisitions of fyfe la and fyfe asia 
these increases were partially offset by a million  or  decline in revenues across all of our water and wastewater operations 
gross profit margin increased basis points because of the recovery in our north american water and wastewater segment primarily as a result of improved project management and due to strong margin performance from our north american operations of fyfe 
consolidated operating expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily related to our recent acquisitions and increased costs to support the global growth of our energy and mining segment 
our water and wastewater segment s operating expenses declined due to continued cost containment efforts and organizational improvements that were implemented in the second half of total contract backlog was a record million at december  compared to million at december  the december  levels include million of backlog from our acquisitions of fyfe asia and fyfe la 
our north american water and wastewater segment increased backlog by million  or  year over year from increased market activity and several large project wins during compared to dollars in thousands increase decrease revenues gross profit gross profit margin n a bp operating expenses reversal of earnout acquisition related expenses   n m restructuring charges   n m operating income operating margin n a bp income from continuing operations consolidated net income from continuing operations was million  or  lower in than in the decline was primarily due to performance issues and project delays in our north american water and wastewater business experienced throughout most of the year 
our north american water and wastewater business experienced challenging market conditions  including a product mix shift to lower margin small diameter pipes  smaller projects and other market challenges in project bids and releases 
additionally  our energy and mining segment experienced a lull in large diameter pipe coating projects 
also contributing to the decline in income from continuing operations were acquisition related costs of million million  net of tax  restructuring costs associated with a reduction in force of million million  net of tax and expenses associated with an expanded credit facility  which included a million million  net of tax make whole payment for the redemption of our outstanding senior notes and million million  net of tax write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
revenues during increased by million  or  primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from our recent acquisitions of crts  hockway and fyfe na and international revenue growth in our industrial linings operations 
these growth areas were partially offset by downturns in our north american water and wastewater business  as well as our pipe coating operations in the united states 
gross margins in were lower than the margins achieved in primarily due to lower gross margins achieved by our north american water and wastewater segment due to delays in project bids and releases causing lower volume and other performance issues principally in the western and eastern regions of the united states 
in addition  in there were a larger percentage of small diameter pipe projects putting pressure on project management and margins 
gross margin rates achieved by our energy and mining segment were lower than the prior year due to a change in the geographic mix of our industrial linings operations  which performed more work internationally  where margins are historically lower than north america and a change in the product mix in our coating operations to smaller diameter 
consolidated operating expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily related to our recent acquisitions and increased costs to support the global growth of our energy and mining segment 
these increases were partially offset by continued focus on operational efficiencies and cost containment efforts throughout the organization  specifically our north american water and wastewater segment 
total contract backlog was million at december  compared to million at december  the december  level includes million of backlog from our acquisitions of crts  fyfe na and hockway 
additionally  through our united pipeline systems joint venture  we were awarded a million dollar project in morocco during the fourth quarter of  which is the largest contract ever awarded to our energy and mining segment

the industrial linings operation recorded record revenue levels  primarily due to the moroccan project and continued global expansion 
our cathodic protection operation increased revenues million  or  from a more robust sales market 
finally  our coating and robotic coating operations increased revenues million  or  because of increased larger project work and concrete coating jobs as well as a full year of operations from our robotic coating operation 
our energy and mining segment is active in six primary geographic regions the united states  canada  mexico  south america  the middle east and europe  and includes pipeline rehabilitation  pipe coating and design and installation of cathodic protection systems 
our energy and mining segment contract backlog decreased million  or  to million at december  compared to december  because of record revenue levels in our industrial linings operations as we executed a significant portion of the morocco project and continued global expansion 
the industrial linings business nearly offset the backlog burn from the morocco project with strong backlog growth both domestically and in the middle east 
the overall energy and mining decrease was partially offset by increased backlog levels in our cathodic protection operations 
our industrial linings operations had record revenue levels due primarily to the large project in morocco 
we anticipate healthy global markets will lead to expansion within existing geographies for our corrosion engineering and industrial lining platforms as well as new geographies  specifically  in asia and the middle east 
we continue to believe that continued strong commodity prices coupled with ever increasing demand for maintenance spending in the sector  more significant opportunities in offshore pipeline development  particularly in the gulf of mexico  along with continued growth in our businesses situated in the key infrastructure spend areas of canada  the middle east and south america  provide us significant growth opportunities well into the future 
revenues in our energy and mining segment increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in revenues for our industrial linings operations increased million  or  due to strong demand for our services in north america  coupled with million in international growth  particularly in australia  while our cathodic protection operations increased by million  or  due to growth within our core north american operations  again from strong market activity 
our pipe coating operations experienced a million  or  decline in revenues compared to the prior year due to a lull in availability of large diameter pipe coating projects 
the mix of work in the on shore shale gas pipelines shifted toward smaller diameter projects  where our coating operations face stronger competition from domestic pipe mills with coating capabilities  resulting in a decline in backlog 
our industrial linings operations experienced growth in all of its geographies and expanded its operations with work in the middle east and africa during additionally  this segment included million and million of revenues from our recent acquisition of crts june  and hockway august   respectively 
gross profit and gross profit margin our energy and mining segment gross profit increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in  however  our gross margins declined by basis points during our gross profit increased across all product lines with the largest increases coming from a million  or  increase in our industrial linings operation and an million  or  increase from a full year of results in our robotic coating operation 
we experienced a basis point margin decline in our industrial linings operations  due to the growth of international markets  which historically have lower margins and a basis point margin decline in our coating operations from a larger mix of more commodity type coating projects 
we believe our energy and mining segment is well positioned for strong growth in due to the anticipated execution of our large robotic project for the offshore wasit gas field  growth from our cathodic protection operations from increasing capital investments in north america and in new geographies for engineered pipeline integrity systems  higher margin projects for our industrial linings operation and improved pipe coating activity for bayou 
our industrial linings operation will work to secure higher margin projects during  which should offset the revenue shortfall expected during from the expected first half of completion of the million morocco phosphate lining project 
our energy and mining segment gross profit increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily due to an million gross profit increase in our industrial linings operations from strong commodity pricing and energy demand 
our results also included million of gross profit from our acquisitions of crts and hockway 
in our gross profit margin declined to compared to in  due to a change in the geographic mix of our industrial linings operations  which performed more work in south america  where margins are historically lower than other regions due to a larger percentage of non lining work on projects 
additionally  our pipe coating operations experienced an million  or  decline in gross profit due to a change in the product mix in our coating operations  coupled with fewer large diameter onshore gas pipeline coating projects being performed than the prior year as previously discussed 
we also had a number of larger international projects where margins are lower than in our core north american markets 
operating expenses operating expenses in our energy and mining segment increased by million  or  in compared to the primary driver for the increase in operating expenses was additional project management and administrative personnel in the united states and the middle east to support the significant geographic expansion of this business 
additionally  this segment included million and million of additional operating expenses from a full year of operations of crts and hockway  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  our energy and mining operating expenses were for compared to for due to healthy top line growth and resulting coverage leverage 
operating expenses in our energy and mining segment increased by million  or  in compared to the primary driver behind the increase in operating expenses was a million increase in our industrial linings operations to support the organization s growth  specifically in new international markets primarily due to additional project management and administrative personnel in the united states and the middle east 
additionally  this segment included million and million  respectively  in operating expenses from the crts and hockway acquisitions  including million of purchase price depreciation and amortization 
as a percentage of revenues  our energy and mining operating expenses were for and for additionally  we incurred million and million of acquisition related expenses and severance costs during operating income and operating margin during  we recorded million and million reversal of the earnouts related to crts and hockway  respectively  because their current year results were below the stated threshold amounts within the respective purchase agreements 
in addition  included million of acquisition related costs  million of restructuring costs associated with a reduction in force and a million reversal of the earnout related to our acquisition of bayou 
operating income increased million  or  to million in compared to million in operating margin was in compared to in the operating income increase during was due to improved performance across all operations and the earnout reversal recorded for crts and hockway  as previously discussed 
lower gross margins and higher operating expenses  including acquisition related and reduction in force expenditures  partially offset by higher revenue  led to a million  or  decrease in operating income in compared to operating margin decreased to in compared to in due to lower gross margins described earlier

the decline in was primarily the result of reduced backlog in the first half of  part of which reflects a more selective bid targeting and pricing strategy to support gross margin expansion 
the largest decline came from the united states contracting regions  which decreased revenues by million  or 
third party tube sales increased by million  or  to million in compared to as a result of continued efforts to supply the market with our high quality manufactured products 
contract backlog in our north american water and wastewater segment at december  was million 
this represented a million  or  increase from backlog at december  the increase in backlog is due to domestic growth  specifically the eastern region of the united states  which has seen improved market conditions and increased bidding activity during  including our recent million win in baltimore 
we anticipate modest growth in the market in from more stabilized municipal spending for wastewater pipeline rehabilitation 
revenues decreased million  or  in to million in our north american water and wastewater segment compared to the prior year 
overall  the decrease was primarily due to lower backlog levels and delays in bids and project releases in the eastern and western regions of the united states as well as a higher percentage of small diameter pipe projects 
additionally  we were impacted by continuous severe weather during the early part of the decreases were partially offset by growth in our canadian operations as well as a million increase in third party tube sales 
gross profit and gross profit margin gross profit in our north american water and wastewater segment increased by to million in compared to million in our north american water and wastewater segment experienced a number of performance issues during the first half of  which negatively impacted profitability of the segment 
these issues included isolated poor project management in certain regions and failure in the execution of certain projects primarily in our atlantic region of the united states 
during the second half of  we implemented a number of changes in this segment in order to address these performance issues including reducing our crew levels  enhancing our bidding discipline  re establishing an organizational commitment to quality in execution and changes in senior management of this segment 
these actions were implemented with success during  which saw an increase in gross profit of million  or  despite an decline in revenues 
furthermore  gross profit margins increased to in from in the gross margin improvement of basis points was primarily due to improved project execution  improved bidding discipline and the effects of our efforts to improve our project management organizational structure 
gross profit in our north american water and wastewater segment decreased by to million in compared to million in gross profit margins decreased from in to in the decrease was primarily due to the decline in revenues and compressed gross margins resulting from project execution issues  magnified by project release delays significantly impacting crew utilization 
our opportunities for new jobs decreased by more than due to the weak economy in the united states  particularly with respect to our municipal customers  as well as the loss of available spending made available through the federal government s infrastructure stimulus program  which expired in additionally  in  municipalities tendered smaller projects with predominately small diameter scope with lower margins 
the small diameter projects are the most competitive portion of our market where our competitors are very aggressive in bidding these projects 
these market and competitive pressures lowered our overall margin profile for this segment beginning in the second half of and persisted throughout operating expenses operating expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to primarily due to a continued focus on operational efficiencies and resource management including the cost reduction initiatives taken in the second half of operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues  were in and in operating expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to primarily due to a continued focus on operational efficiencies and resource management as well as lower corporate allocations 
operating expenses  as a percentage of revenues  were in compared to in additionally  in  we recorded million of severance expense related to a reduction in force 
operating income and operating margin operating income increased million  or  to million compared to million in the north american water and wastewater segment operating margin increased to in compared to in driven by the higher gross profit margin levels previously discussed 
lower revenue levels and gross margins partially offset by lower operating expenses led to a million  or  decrease in operating income during compared to the north american water and wastewater segment operating margin decreased to in compared to in driven by the lower gross profit margin levels previously discussed

revenues in all of our geographies within this segment decreased during the year due to weaker market conditions  with the largest decreases coming from our operations in the united kingdom and the netherlands 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in our third party tube sales 
contract backlog in this segment was million at december  this represented an increase of million  or  compared to december  backlog has improved in the united kingdom as we experienced increased bidding opportunities 
our contract backlog is not reflective of anticipated increases in product sales across europe  which continues to gain momentum 
revenues in our european water and wastewater segment increased by million  or  in compared to the increase came from growth across all of our contracting regions  except france  with the largest growth coming from our netherlands operations as well as a million  or  growth in third party tube sales 
gross profit and gross profit margin gross profit decreased by million  or  to million in compared to million in primarily due to the decline in revenues 
in addition  weak economic conditions in spain and re work costs on an isolated project in the united kingdom contributed to the basis point decrease in gross margin in compared to these decreases were partially offset by improved margins in the netherlands and increased third party tube sales 
while  we anticipate challenging market conditions to continue into in many of our european geographies  we do expect our performance to improve in from improving project execution in key markets and increasing tube sales 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in  while gross profit margins declined slightly during the growth from our netherlands operations was at lower margins and we also experienced competitive pressures in switzerland  which reduced our gross profit margin 
the decline in gross profit margin was partially offset by improved performance in france and the united kingdom and increased third party tube sales  which contributed to higher margins 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to  primarily due to cost reduction efforts  closing a facility in the united kingdom during the second half of and our continued focus on cost efficiencies in our contracting operations in various countries 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for  compared to for  primarily as a result of the significant decline in revenue 
additionally  as part of our overall restructuring effort during the third quarter of  european water and wastewater segment incurred million in the third quarter of for severance related costs associated with a reduction in force  primarily in certain of our united kingdom operations  related to its utility construction crews and support staff 
operating expenses increased by million  or  in compared to  due to increased expenditures to drive growth in tube sales and additional support for the growth of the business 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for  a reduction of basis points from for  reflecting efficiencies from regional restructuring efforts and continued focus on expense control 
operating income and operating margin operating income decreased million  or  to million in from million in during  we experienced decreases in operating income in most of our european operations primarily as a result of poor market conditions  which resulted in project delays and increased competition that lowered gross profit margins 
higher revenue  partially offset by slightly higher operating expenses  which included reduction in force expenditures  led to a million  or  increase in operating income in when compared to operating margin slightly increased from in to in excluding the restructuring charges  our operating income increased million  or  compared to  while operating margins increased from to in the same context

fyfe na s product and service offerings also include pipeline rehabilitation  concrete repair  epoxy injection  corrosion mitigation and specialty coatings services 
during january and april  we completed the acquisitions of the fyfe group s latin america and asian operations  respectively 
during  we incurred million of acquisition related expenses in connection with this expansion of our commercial and structural segment 
the time period represents financial results from the date of acquisition of fyfe na approximately four months 
during  we incurred million of acquisition related expenses for this business as well as current and former acquisition targets 
the commercial and structural segment delivered strong performance in  exceeding profitability expectations in north america 
revenue for the segment was behind our expectations due to the purchase of fyfe asia closing in april  rather than january as planned  and we had slightly lower international contributions due to the timing of project awards 
the segment produced strong gross profit and margins due to increased large diameter water transmission rehabilitation projects in our north american operations 
the financial results in were significantly higher than as a result of a full year s operations compared to only four months of operations for our north american business during backlog at december  for the commercial and structural segment was million compared to million at december  the backlog at december  includes million of backlog related to fyfe s international operations  which were acquired during project quoting activity continues to be strong for all areas of fyfe s business  both domestically and internationally

interest expense in included a million make whole payment for our redemption of previously issued senior notes and the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs from our old credit facility 
interest expense increased to million in compared to million in primarily related to the make whole payment and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs discussed above 
interest income increased million to million in compared to million in  due primarily to higher cash balances throughout the year 
interest income was essentially flat in compared to other income expense other income decreased by million to million of expense in compared to million of income in this decrease was primarily due to a one time foreign currency translation adjustment during other income increased by million  or  in compared to primarily due to the one time adjustment discussed above and higher foreign currency gains from foreign denominated liabilities on our balance sheet 
taxes on income our effective tax rate was and in and  respectively  both of which were lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to significant income in jurisdictions with rates lower than the united states 
our deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets were million at december   including a million valuation allowance primarily related to foreign net operating losses

the results were million less than  primarily due to weaker results at bayou coating and insituform germany  our german joint venture 
noncontrolling interests income attributable to noncontrolling interests were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase during was primarily related to the increased activity from our newly formed joint ventures including our united pipeline system joint venture in morocco and the noncontrolling interests of entities acquired in our purchases of fyfe asia and fyfe la 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we purchased the remaining equity interest in our india joint venture 
the decrease during was a result of lower income from our bppc pipe coating joint venture in canada  partially offset by increased net income of our united pipeline systems joint ventures 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents december  in thousands cash and equivalents restricted cash in escrow restricted cash held in escrow relates to deposits made in lieu of retention on specific projects performed for municipalities and state agencies or advance customer payments and compensating balances for bank undertakings in europe 
sources and uses of cash we expect the principal operational use of funds for the foreseeable future will be for capital expenditures  potential acquisitions  working capital and debt service 
during  capital expenditures were primarily for our bayou wasco and bppc joint ventures and supporting growth in our energy and mining operations 
we expect decreased levels of capital expenditures during compared to as we completed two large projects for our energy and mining segment 
however  we do anticipate continued investment to help support our growth objectives 
at december   our cash balances were located worldwide for working capital and support needs 
given our extensive international operations  approximately of our cash is denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements  however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations

at december   we had certain net receivables as discussed the following paragraph that we believe will be collected but are being disputed by the customer in some manner  which have impacted or may meaningfully impact the timing of collection or require us to invoke our contractual rights to an arbitration or mediation process  or take legal action 
if in a future period we believe any of these receivables are no longer collectible  we would increase our allowance for bad debts through a charge to earnings 
as of december   we had approximately million in receivables related to certain projects in india  hong kong  texas and georgia that have been delayed in payment 
we are in various stages of discussions  arbitration and or litigation with the project clients regarding such receivables 
these receivables have been outstanding for various periods from through as of december   we had not reserved or written off any of the balances related to these receivables  as management believes these receivables are fully collectible 
as of december   we had approximately million in receivables related to a project in louisiana and collected the full amount of the receivable during additionally  during  we collected million of the receivables associated with the projects in india 
management believes that these outstanding receivables are fully collectible and a significant portion of the receivables will be collected within the next twelve months 
cash flows from operations cash flows from operating activities provided million in compared to million in the increase in operating cash flow from to was primarily related to higher earnings and significantly improved working capital management  partially offset by non cash earnout reversals 
working capital provided million of cash during compared to million used in this represents a million increase in a source of cash over the prior year period 
the primary component of this increase was a million decrease in accounts receivable  retainage and cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings compared to the same prior year period 
we have continued our focus on cash management practices and started to see progress on collecting our receivable balances 
during  we improved our dso by six days as we placed a stronger emphasis on cash collection as well as improved global cash management practices

additionally  during we paid million of principal related to our outstanding term loan under the credit facility 
in  we also used million to repurchase million shares of our common stock through open market purchases and in connection with our equity compensation programs as discussed in note contained in this report and we received million in proceeds on notes payable and million from our non controlling interest partners  primarily for their portion of the capital expenditures of our new joint ventures 
long term debt on august   we entered into a new million credit facility the credit facility with a syndicate of banks  with bank of america  na serving as the administrative agent and jpmorgan chase bank  na serving as the syndication agent 
the credit facility consists of a million five year revolving credit line and a million five year term loan facility 
the entire amount of the term loan was drawn on august  for the following purposes to pay the million cash purchase price at closing of our acquisition of the north american business of fyfe group  llc  which transaction closed on august   to retire million in indebtedness outstanding under our prior credit facility  to redeem our million  senior notes  due april  and pay the associated million make whole payment due in connection with the redemption of the senior notes  and to fund expenses associated with the credit facility and the fyfe north america transaction 
as part of the transaction  we paid million in arrangement and commitment fees that will be amortized over the life of the credit facility 
generally  interest will be charged on the principal amounts outstanding under the credit facility at the british bankers association libor rate plus an applicable rate ranging from to depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
we can opt for an interest rate equal to a base rate as defined in the credit documents plus an applicable rate  which is based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
the applicable libor borrowing rate libor plus our applicable rate as of december  was approximately 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  for a notional amount of million  which is set to expire in november the swap notional amount mirrors the amortization of million of our original million term loan from the credit facility 
the swap requires us to make a monthly fixed rate payment of calculated on the amortizing million notional amount  and provides us a payment based upon a variable monthly libor interest rate calculated on the amortizing million notional amount 
the annualized borrowing rate of the swap at december  was approximately 
the receipt of the monthly libor based payment offsets a variable monthly libor based interest cost on a corresponding million portion of our term loan from the credit facility 
this interest rate swap is used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the volatility of monthly libor rate movement  and is accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
on march   we executed a second amendment the second amendment to our prior credit agreement dated march  the old credit facility 
the old credit facility was unsecured and initially consisted of a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit  each with a maturity date of march  with the second amendment  we sought to amend the old credit facility to take advantage of lower interest rates available in the debt marketplace  to obtain more favorable loan terms generally and to provide the ability to issue letters of credit with terms beyond the expiration of the original facility 
the second amendment extended the maturity date of the old credit facility from march  to march  and provided us with the ability to increase the amount of the borrowing commitment by up to million in the aggregate compared to million in the aggregate allowed under the old credit facility prior to the second amendment 
the old credit facility was replaced by the credit facility on august  at june   we borrowed million from the line of credit under the old credit facility in order to fund the purchase of crts  which was subsequently repaid in see note to the financial statements contained in this report for additional detail regarding this acquisition 
on august   we recorded million of expense related to the write off of unamortized arrangement and up front commitment fees associated with the old credit facility 
on september   we redeemed our outstanding million  senior notes  due april in connection with the redemption  we paid the holders of the senior notes a million make whole payment in addition to the million principal payment 
our total indebtedness at december  consisted of million of the original million term loan from the credit facility  million on the line of credit under the credit facility and million of third party notes and other bank debt 
additionally  wasco energy loaned bayou wasco million for the purchase of capital assets in  which was designated as third party debt 
additionally  during january   the company and perma pipe canada  inc agreed to loan our bppc joint venture an additional million for the purchase of capital assets increasing the total to million 
as of december   million of the additional million has been funded 
of such amount  million was included in our consolidated financial statements as third party debt as of december  as of december   we had million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under the credit facility 
of such amount  million was collateral for the benefit of certain of our insurance carriers and million were letters of credit or bank guarantees of performance or payment obligations of foreign subsidiaries 
our credit facility is subject to certain financial covenants  including a consolidated financial leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
at december   we had the capacity to borrow up to approximately million of additional debt under our credit facility 
the credit facility also provides for events of default  including  in the event of non payment or certain defaults under other outstanding indebtedness 
see note to the financial statements contained in this report for further discussion on our debt covenants 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  we believe that we have adequate resources and liquidity to fund future cash requirements and debt repayments with cash generated from operations  existing cash balances and additional short and long term borrowing capacity for the next twelve months 
disclosure of contractual obligations and commitments we have entered into various contractual obligations and commitments in the course of our ongoing operations and financing strategies 
contractual obligations are considered to represent known future cash payments that we are required to make under existing contractual arrangements  such as debt and lease agreements 
these obligations may result from both general financing activities or from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related revenue producing activities 
commercial commitments represent contingent obligations  which become payable only if certain pre defined events were to occur  such as funding financial guarantees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for further discussion regarding our commitments and contingencies 
we have entered into several contractual joint ventures in order to develop joint bids on contracts for our installation business 
in these cases  we could be required to complete the joint venture partner s portion of the contract if the partner were unable to complete its portion 
we would be liable for any amounts for which we could not complete the work and for which a third party contractor could not be located to complete the work for the amount awarded in the contract 
while we would be liable for additional costs  these costs would be offset by any related revenues due under that portion of the contract 
we have not experienced any material adverse results from such arrangements 
based on these facts  we currently do not anticipate any future material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows from our contractual joint ventures 
the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands 
this table includes cash obligations related to principal outstanding and interest under existing debt arrangements and operating leases 
payments due by period payments due by period cash obligations total thereafter long term debt and notes payable interest on long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations cash obligations are not discounted 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report regarding our long term debt and credit facility and commitments and contingencies  respectively 
interest on long term debt was calculated using the current annualized rate on our long term debt as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
at december   we had million in earnout liabilities that are subject to payment by the end of the earnout liabilities are excluded from this table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for further detail regarding earnout liabilities associated with our and acquisitions 
liabilities related to financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  income taxes  have not been included in the table above because we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
there were no material purchase commitments at december  off balance sheet arrangements we use various structures for the financing of operating equipment  including borrowings  operating leases and sale leaseback arrangements 
all debt is presented in the balance sheet 
our future commitments were million at december  we also have exposure under performance guarantees by contractual joint ventures and indemnification of our surety 
however  we have never experienced any material adverse effects to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows relative to these arrangements 
at december   our maximum exposure to our joint venture partners proportionate share of performance guarantees was million 
all of our unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method 
we have no other off balance sheet financing arrangements or commitments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report regarding commitments and contingencies 
critical accounting policies discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement dates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
some accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues and costs as construction  engineering and installation contracts progress using the percentage of completion method of accounting  which relies on total expected contract revenues and estimated total costs 
under this method  estimated contract revenues and resulting gross profit margin are recognized based on actual costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenues and gross profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
total estimated costs  and thus contract gross profit  are impacted by changes in productivity  scheduling and the unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  customer needs  customer delays in providing approvals  labor availability  governmental regulation and politics also may affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition and gross profit 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
the effects of any changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in the management s discussion and analysis section of the report  if material 
when current estimates of total contract costs indicate that the contract will result in a loss  the projected loss is recognized in full in the period in which the loss becomes evident 
revenues from change orders  extra work and variations in the scope of work are recognized when it is probable that they will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount can be reliably estimated 
given the uncertainties associated with some of our contracts  it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made 
revisions to estimates could result in the reversal of revenues and gross profit previously recognized 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from percentage of completion accounting 
many of our contracts provide for termination of the contract at the convenience of the customer 
if a contract is terminated prior to completion  we would typically be compensated for progress up to the time of termination and any termination costs 
in addition  many contracts are subject to certain completion schedule requirements with liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met as the result of circumstances that are within our control 
losses on terminated contracts and liquidated damages have historically not been significant 
equity based compensation we record expense for equity based compensation awards  including restricted shares of common stock  performance awards  stock options and stock units  based on the fair value recognition provisions contained in fasb asc  compensation stock compensation fasb asc 
the fair value of stock option awards is determined using an option pricing model that is based on established principles of financial economic theory 
assumptions regarding volatility  expected term  dividend yield and risk free rate are required for valuation of stock option awards 
volatility and expected term assumptions are based on our historical experience 
the risk free rate is based on a us treasury note with a maturity similar to the option award s expected term 
the fair value of restricted stock  restricted stock unit and deferred stock unit awards is determined using our closing stock price on the award date 
the shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that were awarded during are subject to service restrictions 
we make forfeiture rate assumptions in connection with the valuation of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards that could be different than actual experience 
additionally  during  we introduced three year performance based stock unit awards for a number of our key employees 
these awards are subject to performance and service restrictions 
the awards contain financial targets for each year in the three year performance period as well as cumulative totals 
these awards have a threshold  target and maximum amount of shares that could be awarded based on our financial results for each year 
the awards allow an employee to earn back a portion of the shares that were unearned in a prior year  if cumulative performance targets are met 
discussion of our application of fasb asc is described in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
taxation we provide for estimated income taxes payable or refundable on current year income tax returns  as well as the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards  in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes fasb asc 
fasb asc also requires that a valuation allowance be recorded against any deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized in the future 
the determination is based on our ability to generate future taxable income and  at times  is dependent on our ability to implement strategic tax initiatives to ensure full utilization of recorded deferred tax assets 
should we not be able to implement the necessary tax strategies  we may need to record valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets  including those related to foreign income tax benefits 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against net deferred tax assets 
in accordance with fasb asc  tax benefits from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
in addition  this recognition model includes a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in accordance with fasb asc this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with fasb asc and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december  and were appropriately accounted for in accordance with fasb asc  the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 
we have recorded income tax expense at us tax rates on all profits  except for undistributed profits of non us subsidiaries of approximately million  which are considered indefinitely reinvested 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the indefinitely reinvested profits is not feasible 
a deferred tax asset is recognized only if we have definite plans to generate a us tax benefit by repatriating earnings in the foreseeable future 
goodwill under fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other fasb asc  we assess recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
our annual assessment was last completed as of october  an impairment charge will be recognized to the extent that the implied fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
factors that could potentially trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to significant underperformance of a segment relative to expected  historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes in the strategy for a segment including extended slowdowns in the segment s market  a decrease in our market capitalization below our book value for an extended period of time  and a significant change in regulations 
our recorded goodwill by reportable segment was as follows at december  in millions energy and mining north american water and wastewater european water and wastewater asia pacific water and wastewater commercial and structural total goodwill in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  we determined the fair value of our reporting units at the annual impairment assessment date and compared such fair value to the carrying value of those reporting units to determine if there were any indications of goodwill impairment 
our reporting units for purposes of assessing goodwill are north american water and wastewater  european water and wastewater  asia pacific water and wastewater  united pipeline systems  bayou  corrpro  crts  hockway  fyfe na  fyfe latin america and fyfe asia 
fair value of reporting units is determined using a combination of two valuation methods a market approach and an income approach with each method given equal weight in determining the fair value assigned to each reporting unit 
absent an indication of fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transaction  we believe the use of these two methods provides a reasonable estimate of a reporting unit s fair value 
assumptions common to both methods are operating plans and economic projections  which are used to project future revenues  earnings and after tax cash flows for each reporting unit 
these assumptions are applied consistently for both methods 
the market approach estimates fair value by first determining earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples for comparable publicly traded companies with similar characteristics of the reporting unit 
the ebitda multiples for comparable companies are based upon current enterprise value 
the enterprise value is based upon current market capitalization and includes a control premium 
management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units 
the income approach is based on projected future debt free cash flows that are discounted to present value using factors that consider timing and risk of future cash flows 
management believes this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long term operating cash flow performance 
discounted cash flow projections are based on financial forecasts developed from operating plans and economic projections  growth rates  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins  terminal value growth rates  future capital expenditures and changes in working capital requirements 
estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes to business models  changes in our weighted average cost of capital or changes in operating performance 
significant assumptions used in our october goodwill review included i compounding annual growth rates generally ranging from to  ii sustained or slightly increased gross margins  iii peer group ebitda multiples  iv terminal values for each reporting unit using a long term growth rate of to  and v discount rates ranging from to 
if actual results differ from estimates used in these calculations  we could incur future impairment charges 
for purposes of our goodwill review  we have ten reporting units 
during our assessment of our ten reporting units fair values in relation to their respective carrying values  five had a fair value in excess of of their carrying value and five were within percent of their carrying value 
the total value of goodwill recorded at the impairment testing date for the latter five was million 
included in these five was fyfe na  fyfe la and fyfe asia  all of which were acquired within thirteen months of the goodwill test date 
accordingly  it is expected that their fair values would approximate their carrying values 
in addition  our european water and wastewater s fair value exceeded its carrying value by just 
due to the recent macroeconomic issues throughout europe  the fair value of this reporting unit decreased million  or  from the prior year analysis 
as with all of our reporting units  we continuously monitor potential trigger events that may cause an interim impairment valuation 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes and of foreign currency and commodity price fluctuations 
we currently do not use derivative contracts to manage commodity risks 
from time to time  we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to fix exchange rates for net investments in foreign operations to hedge our foreign exchange risk 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at december  approximated carrying value 
given the short term nature of these instruments  market risk  as measured by the change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates  would not be material 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain fixed rate debt whenever favorable  however  the majority of our debt at december  was variable rate debt 
at december  and  the estimated fair value of our long term debt was approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was estimated using market rates for debt of similar risk and maturity and a discounted cash flow model 
market risk related to the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in our debt specific borrowing rates at december  would result in a million increase in interest expense 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  for a notional amount of million  which is set to expire in november the swap notional amount mirrors the amortization of million of our original million term loan from the credit facility 
the swap requires us to make a monthly fixed rate payment of calculated on the amortizing million notional amount  and provides us a payment based upon a variable monthly libor interest rate calculated on the amortizing million notional amount 
the receipt of the monthly libor based payment offsets a variable monthly libor based interest cost on a corresponding million portion of our term loan from the credit facility 
this interest rate swap is used to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the volatility of monthly libor rate movement  and is accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
foreign exchange risk we operate subsidiaries and are associated with licensees and affiliated companies operating solely outside of the united states and in foreign currencies 
consequently  we are inherently exposed to risks associated with the fluctuation in the value of the local currencies compared to the us dollar 
at december   a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents were denominated in foreign currencies  and a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates could result in an approximate million impact to our equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
in order to help mitigate this risk  we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not engage in hedging transactions for speculative investment reasons 
there can be no assurance that our hedging operations will eliminate or substantially reduce risks associated with fluctuating currencies 
at december   there were no material foreign currency hedge instruments outstanding 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report for additional information and disclosures regarding our derivative financial instruments 
commodity risk we have exposure to the effect of limitations on supply and changes in commodity pricing relative to a variety of raw materials that we purchase and use in our operating activities  most notably resin  iron ore  chemicals  staple fiber  fuel  metals and pipe 
we manage this risk by entering into agreements with certain suppliers utilizing a request for proposal  or rfp  format and purchasing in bulk  and advantageous buying on the spot market for certain metals  when possible 
we also manage this risk by continuously updating our estimation systems for bidding contracts so that we are able to price our products and services appropriately to our customers 
however  we face exposure on contracts in process that have already been priced and are not subject to any cost adjustments in the contract 
this exposure is potentially more significant on our longer term projects 
we obtain a majority of our global resin requirements  one of our primary raw materials  from multiple suppliers in order to diversify our supplier base and thus reduce the risks inherent in concentrated supply streams 
we have qualified a number of vendors in north america  europe and asia that can deliver  and are currently delivering  proprietary resins that meet our specifications 
iron ore inventory balances are managed according to our anticipated volume of concrete weight coating projects 
we obtain the majority of our iron ore from a limited number of suppliers  and pricing can be volatile 
iron ore is typically purchased near the start of each project 
concrete weight coating revenue accounts for a small percentage of our overall revenues 
the primary products and raw materials used by our commercial and structural segment in the manufacture of frp composite systems are carbon  glass  resins  fabric  and epoxy raw materials 
fabric and epoxies are the largest materials purchased  which are currently purchased through a select group of suppliers  although we believe these and the other materials are available from a number of vendors 
the price of epoxy historically is affected by the price of oil 
in addition  a number of factors such as worldwide demand  labor costs  energy costs  import duties and other trade restrictions may influence the price of these raw materials
