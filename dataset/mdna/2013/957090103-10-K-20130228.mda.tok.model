item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  loan portfolio credit risk  million of the company s purchased loans as of december  are indemnified by the fdic  such indemnification expires february  for approximately percent of the loans and february  for approximately percent of the loans 
the risk inherent in such loans will increase with the expiration of fdic indemnification 
the company s operations are concentrated geographically in california  and poor economic conditions may cause the company to incur losses 
substantially all of the company s business is located in california 
a portion of the loan portfolio of the company is dependent on real estate 
at december   real estate served as the principal source of collateral with respect to approximately of the company s loan portfolio 
the company s financial condition and operating results will be subject to changes in economic conditions in california 
the california economy is currently weak following a severe recession 
much of the california real estate market has experienced a decline in values of varying degrees 
this decline is having an adverse impact on the business of some of the company s borrowers and on the value of the collateral for many of the company s loans 
generally  the counties surrounding and near san francisco bay have been recovering from the recent recession more soundly than counties in the california central valley  from sacramento in the north to bakersfield in the south 
approximately percent of the company s loans are to borrowers in the california central valley 
economic conditions in california are subject to various uncertainties at this time  including the decline in construction and real estate sectors  the california state government s budgetary difficulties and continuing fiscal difficulties 
the company can provide no assurance that conditions in the california economy will not deteriorate in the future and that such deterioration will not adversely affect the company 
the markets in which the company operates are subject to the risk of earthquakes and other natural disasters 
most of the properties of the company are located in california 
also  most of the real and personal properties which currently secure some of the company s loans are located in california 
california is prone to earthquakes  brush fires  flooding  drought and other natural disasters 
in addition to possibly sustaining damage to its own properties  if there is a major earthquake  flood  fire or other natural disaster  the company faces the risk that many of its borrowers may experience uninsured property losses  or sustained job interruption and or loss which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their loan obligations 
a major earthquake  flood  prolonged drought  fire or other natural disaster in california could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
adverse changes in general business or economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a sustained or continuing weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which the company does business could have one or more of the following adverse impacts on the company s business a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the company  an increase or decrease in the usage of unfunded credit commitments  a decrease in the amount of deposits  a decrease in non depository funding available to the company  an impairment of certain intangible assets  such as goodwill  an increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent  file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company  which could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs  provision for loan losses  and valuation adjustments on assets  an impairment in the value of investment securities  an impairment in the value of life insurance policies owned by the company  an impairment in the value of real estate owned by the company 
recent market conditions led to the failure or merger of a number of financial institutions 
financial institution failures can result in further losses as a consequence of defaults on securities issued by them and defaults under contracts entered into with such entities as counterparties 
weak economic conditions can significantly weaken the strength and liquidity of financial institutions 
the company s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  is highly dependent upon on the business environment in the markets where the company operates  in the state of california and in the united states as a whole 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  economic growth  healthy labor markets  efficient capital markets  low inflation  high business and investor confidence  and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  high rates of unemployment  declines in business activity or consumer  investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability of or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation or interest rates  natural disasters  or a combination of these or other factors 
such business conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of the company s loans  the demand for loans  loan volumes and related revenue  securities valuations  amounts of deposits  availability of funding  results of operations and financial condition 
the value of securities in the company s investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in securities markets the market for some of the investment securities held in the company s portfolio can be extremely volatile 
volatile market conditions may detrimentally affect the value of these securities  such as through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks 
there can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in other than temporary impairments of these assets  which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company s net income and capital levels 
regulatory risks restrictions on dividends and other distributions could limit amounts payable to the company 
as a holding company  a substantial portion of the company s cash flow typically comes from dividends paid by the bank 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends the company s subsidiaries can pay to the company without regulatory approval 
a reduction in subsidiary dividends paid to the company could limit the capacity of the company to pay dividends 
in addition  if any of the company s subsidiaries were to liquidate  that subsidiary s creditors will be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of that subsidiary to satisfy their claims against it before the company  as a holder of an equity interest in the subsidiary  will be entitled to receive any of the assets of the subsidiary 
adverse effects of changes in banking or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal or monetary policies could adversely affect the company 
the company is subject to significant federal and state regulation and supervision  which is primarily for the benefit and protection of the company s customers and not for the benefit of investors 
in the past  the company s business has been materially affected by these regulations 
as an example  the frb amended regulation e  which implements the electronic fund transfer act  in a manner that limits the ability of a financial institution to assess an overdraft fee for paying automated teller machine atm and one time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer s account  unless the consumer affirmatively consents  or opts in  to the institution s payment of overdrafts for these transactions 
implementation of the new provisions significantly reduced overdraft fees assessed by the bank 
laws  regulations or policies  including accounting standards and interpretations currently affecting the company and the company s subsidiaries  may change at any time 
regulatory authorities may also change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations 
therefore  the company s business may be adversely affected by any future changes in laws  regulations  policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement including future acts of terrorism  major us corporate bankruptcies and reports of accounting irregularities at us public companies 
additionally  the company s business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 
the company is particularly affected by the policies of the frb  which regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states of america 
under long standing policy of the frb  a bhc is expected to act as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks 
as a result of that policy  the company may be required to commit financial and other resources to its subsidiary bank in circumstances where the company might not otherwise do so 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the frb are a conducting open market operations in us government securities  b changing the discount rates of borrowings by depository institutions  c changing interest rates paid on balances financial institutions deposit with the frb  and d imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the policies of the frb may have a material effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the frb has been providing vast amounts of liquidity into the banking system due to current economic and capital market conditions 
the frb has been purchasing large quantities of us government securities  including agency backed mortgage securities  increasing the demand for such securities thereby reducing interest rates 
a reduction in the frb s activities or capacity could reduce liquidity in the markets and cause interest rates to rise  thereby increasing funding costs to the bank or reducing the availability of funds to the bank to finance its existing operations and causing investment securities and loans to decline in value 
federal and state governments could pass legislation detrimental to the company s performance 
as an example  the company could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that reduces the amount the bank borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts 
also  the company could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that limits or delays the bank ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or makes foreclosure less economically feasible 
the fdic insures deposits at insured financial institutions up to certain limits 
the fdic charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund 
recent economic conditions have increased bank failures  in which case the fdic takes control of failed banks and insures payment of deposits up to insured limits using the resources of the deposit insurance fund 
in such case  the fdic may increase premium assessments to maintain adequate funding of the deposit insurance fund 
the behavior of depositors in regard to the level of fdic insurance could cause our existing customers to reduce the amount of deposits held at the bank  and could cause new customers to open deposit accounts at the bank 
the level and composition of the bank deposit portfolio directly impacts the bank funding cost and net interest margin 
systems  accounting and internal control risks the accuracy of the company s judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact operating results and financial condition 
the discussion under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies in this report and the information referred to in that discussion is incorporated by reference in this paragraph 
the company makes certain estimates and judgments in preparing its financial statements 
the quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
the company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the company s accounting  customer relationship management and other systems 
communication and information systems failures can result from a variety of risks including  but not limited to  telecommunication line integrity  weather  terrorist acts  natural disasters  accidental disasters  unauthorized breaches of security systems  and other events 
there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately corrected by the company or its vendors 
the occurrence of any such failures  interruptions or security breaches could damage the company s reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose the company to litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates the company s internal control over financial reporting  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
the company maintains controls and procedures to mitigate against risks such as processing system failures and errors  and customer or employee fraud  and maintains insurance coverage for certain of these risks 
any system of controls and procedures  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
events could occur which are not prevented or detected by the company s internal controls or are not insured against or are in excess of the company s insurance limits or insurance underwriters financial capacity 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may have underestimated losses on purchased loans 
on february   the bank acquired approximately billion in loans and repossessed loan collateral of the former county bank from the fdic as its receiver 
at december   million in loans and million in repossessed loan collateral remained outstanding 
on august   the bank acquired approximately million in loans and repossessed loan collateral of the former sonoma valley bank from the fdic as its receiver 
at december   million in loans and million in repossessed loan collateral remained outstanding 
these purchased assets had suffered substantial deterioration at the respective acquisition dates  and the company can provide no assurance that they will not continue to deteriorate now that they are the bank s assets 
if management s estimates of purchased asset fair values as of the acquisition dates are higher than ultimate cash flows  the recorded carrying amount of the assets may need to be reduced with a corresponding charge to earnings  net of fdic loss indemnification on former county bank assets

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion addresses information pertaining to the financial condition and results of operations of westamerica bancorporation and subsidiaries the company that may not be otherwise apparent from a review of the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
it should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes found on pages through  as well as with the other information presented throughout the report 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires the company to make certain estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the company utilizes third party sources to value its investment securities  securities individually valued using quoted prices in active markets are classified as level assets in the fair value hierarchy  and securities valued using quoted prices in active markets for similar securities commonly referred to as matrix pricing are classified as level assets in the fair value hierarchy 
the company validates the reliability of third party provided values by comparing individual security pricing for a sample of securities between more than one third party source 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses accounting and purchased loan accounting to be the accounting areas requiring the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
a discussion of the factors affecting accounting for the allowance for loan losses and purchased loans is included in the loan portfolio credit risk discussion below 
acquisitions as described in note  westamerica bank bank acquired assets and assumed liabilities of the former sonoma valley bank sonoma on august  from the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
on february   the bank acquired assets and assumed liabilities of the former county bank county from the fdic 
the bank acquired approximately billion assets and assumed approximately billion liabilities 
the bank and the fdic entered loss sharing agreements regarding future losses incurred on acquired loans and foreclosed loan collateral 
under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic absorbs percent of losses and is entitled to percent of loss recoveries on the first million of losses  and absorbs percent of losses and is entitled to percent of loss recoveries on losses exceeding million 
the loss sharing agreement on residential real estate loans expires february  and the loss sharing agreement on non residential real estate loans expires february  as to losses and february  as to loss recoveries 
for further information regarding the fdic loss sharing agreements  see the loan portfolio credit risk section of this report 
in both acquisitions  the acquired assets and assumed liabilities were measured at estimated fair values  as required by fasb asc  business combinations 
management made significant estimates and exercised significant judgment in accounting for the acquisition 
management judgmentally measured loan fair values based on loan file reviews including borrower financial statements and tax returns  appraised collateral values  expected cash flows  and historical loss factors 
repossessed loan collateral was primarily valued based upon appraised collateral values 
the bank also recorded identifiable intangible assets representing the value of the core deposit customer bases based on an evaluation of the cost of such deposits relative to alternative funding sources 
in determining the value of the identifiable intangible asset  management used significant estimates including average lives of depository accounts  future interest rate levels  the cost of servicing various depository products  future fdic insurance assessments  and other significant estimates 
management used quoted market prices to determine the fair value of investment securities  fhlb advances and other borrowings 
net income during the three years ended december   market interest rates declined to low levels 
the federal reserve s federal open market committee has maintained highly accommodative monetary polices to influence interest rates to low levels in order to provide stimulus to the economy following the financial crisis recession 
the company s principal source of revenue is net interest and fee income  which represents interest earned on loans and investment securities earning assets reduced by interest paid on deposits and other borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
the change in market interest rates in the three years ended december  has reduced the spread between interest rates on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as a result  the company s net interest income has declined 
the company also earns revenue from service charges on deposit accounts  merchant processing services  debit card fees  and other fees noninterest income 
service charges on deposit accounts are subject to laws and regulations  recent regulations and customer activity have caused service charges on deposit account to decline in the three years ended december   however  merchant processing fees  debit card fees and trust fees have increased due to higher transaction volumes and the company s sales efforts 
the company incurs noninterest expenses to deliver products and services to our customers 
management is focused on controlling noninterest expense levels  particularly due to the recent market interest rate pressure on net interest and fee income 
components of net income year ended december  dollars in thousands except per share amounts net interest and fee income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income before income taxes taxes net income net income applicable to common equity per average fully diluted common share net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average shareholders equity net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average total assets fully taxable equivalent fte comparing to  net income applicable to common equity decreased million  primarily due to lower net interest income fte and a million loss on sale of securities  partially offset by decreases in noninterest expense and income tax provision fte 
the lower net interest income fte was primarily caused by a lower average volume of loans and lower yields on interest earning assets  partially offset by higher average balances of investments  lower average balances of interest bearing liabilities and lower rates on interest bearing deposits 
the provision for loan losses remained the same  reflecting management evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio not covered by loss sharing agreements with the fdic and purchased loan credit default discounts

in management s opinion  current levels of competitive loan pricing do not provide adequate forward earnings potential 
as a result  the company has not currently taken an aggressive posture relative to loan portfolio growth 
management has maintained relatively stable interest earning asset volumes by increasing investment securities as loan volumes have declined 
yields on interest earning assets have declined due to relatively low interest rates prevailing in the market 
economic conditions  competitive pricing and deleveraging by businesses and individuals have reduced loan volumes  placing greater reliance on lower yielding investment securities 
rates on interest bearing deposits and borrowings have declined to offset some of the decline in asset yields

provision for loan losses the company manages credit costs by consistently enforcing conservative underwriting and administration procedures and aggressively pursuing collection efforts with debtors experiencing financial difficulties 
the provision for loan losses reflects management assessment of credit risk in the loan portfolio during each of the periods presented 
the company provided million each for loan losses in  and the company recorded purchased county bank county and sonoma loans at estimated fair value upon the acquisition dates  february  and august   respectively 
such estimated fair values were recognized for individual loans  although small balance homogenous loans were pooled for valuation purposes 
the valuation discounts recorded for purchased loans included management s assessment of the risk of principal loss under economic and borrower conditions prevailing on the dates of purchase 
the purchased county loans are covered by loss sharing agreements the company entered with the fdic which mitigates losses during the term of the agreements 
any deterioration in estimated value related to principal loss subsequent to the acquisition dates requires additional loss recognition through a provision for loan losses 
of the total recorded provision  the company provided million and thousand for purchased loans in and  respectively 
no assurance can be given future provisions for loan losses related to purchased loans will not be necessary

the income tax provision fte was million in compared with million in the effective tax rate fte was compared to in the effective tax rates without fte adjustments were and for and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate fte in is primarily attributable to tax exempt interest income representing a higher proportion of pre tax income and increased limited partnership tax credits 
investment portfolio the company maintains a securities portfolio consisting of securities issued by us government sponsored entities  state and political subdivisions  corporations and asset backed and other securities 
investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian 
management has maintained relatively stable interest earning asset volumes by increasing investment securities as loan volumes have declined 
investment securities assigned to the available for sale portfolio are generally used to supplement the company liquidity  provide a prudent yield  and provide collateral for public deposits and other borrowing facilities 
unrealized net gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded as an adjustment to equity  net of taxes  but are not reflected in the current earnings of the company 
if management determines depreciation  due to credit risk  in any available for sale security is other than temporary  a securities loss will be recognized as a charge to earnings 
if a security is sold  any gain or loss is reflected in current earnings and the equity adjustment is reversed 
at december   the company held million in securities classified as investments available for sale with a duration of years 
at december   an unrealized gain  net of taxes  of million related to these securities was included in shareholders equity 
securities assigned to the held to maturity portfolio earn a prudent yield  provide liquidity from maturities and paydowns  and provide collateral to pledge for federal  state and local government deposits and other borrowing facilities 
at december   the held to maturity investment portfolio had a duration of years and included billion in fixed rate and million in adjustable rate securities 
if management determines depreciation in any held to maturity security is other than temporary  a securities loss will be recognized as a charge to earnings 
the company had no trading securities at december  for more information on investment securities  see the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements

loans originated by the company following its loan underwriting policies and procedures are separated from purchased loans 
former county bank loans purchased from the fdic with loss sharing agreements purchased covered loans are segregated as are former sonoma valley bank loans purchased from the fdic without loss sharing agreements purchased non covered loans 
loan volumes have declined due to problem loan workout activities  particularly with purchased loans  and reduced volumes of loan originations 
in management s opinion  current levels of competitive loan pricing do not provide adequate forward earnings potential 
as a result  the company has not currently taken an aggressive posture relative to loan portfolio growth 
the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio of the company by type of loan and type of borrower  on the dates indicated originated loan portfolio at december  in thousands commercial commercial real estate real estate construction real estate residential consumer total loans purchased covered loan portfolio at december  in thousands commercial commercial real estate real estate construction real estate residential consumer total loans purchased non covered loan portfolio at december  in thousands commercial commercial real estate real estate construction real estate residential consumer total loans the following table shows the maturity distribution and interest rate sensitivity of commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loans at december  balances exclude residential real estate loans and consumer loans totaling million

such commitments can be either secured or unsecured and are typically in the form of revolving lines of credit for seasonal working capital needs 
occasionally  such commitments are in the form of letters of credit to facilitate the customers particular business transactions 
commitment fees are generally charged for commitments and letters of credit 
commitments on lines of credit and letters of credit typically mature within one year

loan portfolio credit risk the risk that loan customers do not repay loans extended by the bank is a significant risk to the company 
the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and follows a strategy to control exposure to loans with high credit risk 
the bank s organization structure separates the functions of business development and loan underwriting  management believes this segregation of duties avoids inherent conflicts of combining business development and loan approval functions 
in measuring and managing credit risk  the company adheres to the following practices 
the bank maintains a loan review department which reports directly to the board of directors 
the loan review department performs independent evaluations of loans and assigns credit risk grades to evaluated loans using grading standards employed by bank regulatory agencies 
those loans judged to carry higher risk attributes are referred to as classified loans 
classified loans receive elevated management attention to maximize collection 
the bank maintains two loan administration offices whose sole responsibility is to manage and collect classified loans 
classified loans with higher levels of credit risk are further designated as nonaccrual loans 
management places classified loans on nonaccrual status when full collection of contractual interest and principal payments is in doubt 
uncollected interest previously accrued on loans placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income  net of estimated fdic reimbursements under loss sharing agreements 
the company does not accrue interest income on loans following placement on nonaccrual status 
interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the loan unless the carrying amount is well secured by loan collateral or covered by fdic loss sharing agreements 
nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans or more days past due and still accruing  and repossessed loan collateral commonly referred to as other real estate owned 
nonperforming assets at december  in thousands originated nonperforming nonaccrual loans performing nonaccrual loans total nonaccrual loans accruing loans or more days past due total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets purchased covered nonperforming nonaccrual loans performing nonaccrual loans total nonaccrual loans accruing loans or more days past due total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets purchased non covered nonperforming nonaccrual loans performing nonaccrual loans total nonaccrual loans accruing loans or more days past due total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets the bank s commercial loan customers are primarily small businesses and professionals 
as a result  average loan balances are relatively small  providing risk diversification within the overall loan portfolio 
at december   the bank s nonaccrual loans reflected this diversification nonaccrual originated loans with a carrying value totaling million comprised twenty borrowers  nonaccrual purchased covered loans with a carrying value totaling million comprised fifteen borrowers  and nonaccrual purchased non covered loans with a carrying value totaling million comprised eleven borrowers 
management believes the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio is reasonably stable  however  classified and nonperforming assets could fluctuate from period to period 
the performance of any individual loan can be affected by external factors such as the interest rate environment  economic conditions  and collateral values or factors particular to the borrower 
no assurance can be given that additional increases in nonaccrual and delinquent loans will not occur in the future 
the former county bank loans and repossessed loan collateral were purchased from the fdic with indemnifying loss sharing agreements 
the loss sharing agreements significantly reduce the credit risk of these purchased assets during the term of the agreements 
under the terms of the loss sharing agreements  the fdic absorbs percent of losses and shares in percent of loss recoveries on the first million in losses on purchased covered assets first tier  and absorbs percent of losses and shares in percent of loss recoveries if losses on purchased covered assets exceed million second tier 
the loss sharing agreement on covered residential real estate assets expires february  and the loss sharing agreement on covered non residential assets expires february  as to losses and february  as to loss recoveries 
the purchased covered assets are primarily located in the california central valley  including merced county 
this geographic area currently has some of the weakest economic conditions within california and has experienced significant declines in real estate values 
management expects higher loss rates on purchased covered assets than on originated assets 
the bank recorded purchased covered assets at estimated fair value on the february  acquisition date 
the credit risk discount ascribed to the billion acquired loan and repossessed loan collateral portfolio was million representing estimated losses inherent in the assets at the acquisition date 
purchased covered assets in thousands at december  february  non residential assets residential assets total indemnified assets credit risk discount other adjustments carrying value of covered assets comprised of purchased covered loans covered other real estate owned carrying value of covered assets aggregate indemnified losses from february  through december  have been million  which includes principal losses  loss in value of other real estate owned  loss on sale of other real estate owned  and reimbursement of incurred collection and asset management expenses such as legal fees  property taxes  appraisals and other customary expenses 
purchased covered asset principal losses have been primarily offset against the estimated credit risk discount  although some losses exceeding the purchase date estimated credit risk discount have been provided for and charged off against the allowance for credit losses 
purchased covered assets are evaluated for risk classification without regard to fdic indemnification such that management can identify purchased covered assets with potential payment problems and devote appropriate credit administration practices to maximize collections 
classified purchased covered assets without regard to fdic indemnification totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
as noted above  fdic loss indemnification of covered non residential assets expires february   loss exposure on such assets after february  will be represented by such assets carrying values at such time 
loss exposure for loans is mitigated by the borrowers financial condition and ability to repay their loans  loan collateral values  the amount of credit risk discount remaining at such time  any existing borrower guarantees which are perfected and have economic value  and the allowance for credit losses 
loss exposure for other real estate owned is mitigated by the value of the repossessed loan collateral  less disposition costs 
allowance for credit losses the company s allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in evaluating credit risk for loans  management measures loss potential of the carrying value of loans 
as described above  payments received on nonaccrual loans may be applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
further  the carrying value of purchased loans includes fair value discounts assigned at the time of purchase under the provisions of fasb asc  business combinations  and fasb asc  loans or debt securities with deteriorated credit quality 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses in excess of these reductions to the carrying value of loans within the loan portfolio 
the following table summarizes the allowance for credit losses  chargeoffs and recoveries of the company for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands analysis of the allowance for credit losses balance  beginning of period provision for loan losses provision for unfunded commitments loans charged off commercial commercial real estate real estate construction real estate residential consumer and other installment purchased covered loans purchased non covered loans total chargeoffs recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial commercial real estate real estate construction consumer and other installment purchased covered loans total recoveries net loan losses balance  end of period components allowance for loan losses liability for off balance sheet credit exposure allowance for credit losses net loan losses originated loans purchased covered loans purchased non covered loans net loan losses as a percentage of average loans originated loans purchased covered loans purchased non covered loans the company allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate to provide for losses that can be estimated based upon specific and general conditions 
these include conditions unique to individual borrowers  as well as overall credit loss experience  the amount of past due  nonperforming and classified loans  fdic loss sharing indemnification  recommendations of regulatory authorities  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
a portion of the allowance is specifically allocated to impaired loans whose full collectability of principal is uncertain 
such allocations are determined by management based on loan by loan analyses 
the company evaluates all classified loans and nonaccrual loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of thousand  and all troubled debt restructured loans for impairment 
a second allocation is based in part on quantitative analyses of historical credit loss experience  in which historical originated classified credit balances are analyzed using a statistical model to determine standard loss rates for originated loans 
the results of this analysis are applied to originated classified loan balances to allocate the allowance to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
in addition  originated loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines are analyzed based on the historical loss rates and delinquency trends  grouped by the number of days the payments on these loans are delinquent 
given currently weak economic conditions  management is applying further analysis to originated consumer installment loans 
current levels of originated consumer installment loan losses are compared to initial allowance allocations and  based on management s judgment  additional allocations are applied  if needed  to estimate losses 
for originated residential real estate loans  management is comparing ultimate loss rates on foreclosed residential real estate properties and applying such loss rates to nonaccrual originated residential real estate loans 
based on this analysis  management exercises judgment in allocating additional allowance if deemed appropriate to estimate losses on originated residential real estate loans 
last  allocations are made to originated non classified commercial and commercial real estate loans based on historical loss rates and other statistical data 
purchased loans were not underwritten using the company s credit policies and practices 
thus  the historical loss rates for originated loans are not applied to estimate credit losses for purchased loans 
purchased loans were recorded on the date of purchase at estimated fair value  fair value discounts include a component for estimated credit losses 
the company evaluates all nonaccrual purchased loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of thousand for impairment  the impaired loan value is compared to the recorded investment in the loan  which has been reduced by the credit default discount estimated on the date of purchase 
if management s impairment analysis determines the impaired loan value is less than the recorded investment in the purchased loan  an allocation of the allowance for credit losses is established  net of estimated fdic indemnification 
for all other purchased loans  management evaluates post acquisition historical credit losses on purchased loans  credit default discounts on purchased loans  and other data to evaluate the likelihood of realizing the recorded investment of purchased loans 
management establishes allocations of the allowance for credit losses for any estimated deficiency 
the remainder of the allowance is considered to be unallocated 
the unallocated allowance is established to provide for probable losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date but not reflected in the allocated allowance 
the unallocated allowance addresses additional qualitative factors consistent with management analysis of the level of risks inherent in the loan portfolio  which are related to the risks of the company general lending activity 
included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses that are attributable to national or local economic or industry trends which have occurred but have not yet been recognized in loan chargeoff history external factors 
the external factors evaluated by the company and the judgmental amount of unallocated reserve assigned by management as of december  are economic and business conditions million  external competitive issues thousand  and other factors 
also included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses attributable to general attributes of the company loan portfolio and credit administration internal factors 
the internal factors evaluated by the company and the judgmental amount of unallocated reserve assigned by management are loan review system thousand  adequacy of lending management and staff thousand  loan policies and procedures thousand  purchased loans thousand  concentrations of credit thousand  and other factors 
by their nature  these risks are not readily allocable to any specific loan category in a statistically meaningful manner and are difficult to quantify with a specific number 
management assigns a range of estimated risk to the qualitative risk factors described above based on management judgment as to the level of risk  and assigns a quantitative risk factor from the range of loss estimates to determine the appropriate level of the unallocated portion of the allowance

asset liability and market risk management asset liability management involves the evaluation  monitoring and management of interest rate risk  market risk  liquidity and funding 
the fundamental objective of the company management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is a significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk results from many factors 
assets and liabilities may mature or re price at different times 
assets and liabilities may re price at the same time but by different amounts 
short term and long term market interest rates may change by different amounts 
the timing and amount of cash flows of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change 
in addition  interest rates may have an impact on loan demand  demand for various deposit products  credit losses  and other sources of earnings such as account analysis fees on commercial deposit accounts and correspondent bank service charges 
the federal open market committee s january  press release stated the committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above percent  inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the committee s percent longer run goal  and longer term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored 
in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy  the committee will also consider other information  including additional measures of labor market conditions  indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations  and readings on financial developments 
when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation  it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer run goals of maximum employment and inflation of percent 
in this context  management s most likely earnings forecast for the twelve months ending december  assumes market interest rates remain relatively stable and yields on newly originated or refinanced loans and on purchased investment securities will reflect current interest rates  which are lower than yields on the company s older dated loans and investment securities 
in adjusting the company asset liability position  management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing the net interest margin and net interest income 
at times  depending on expected increases or decreases in general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may adjust the company interest rate risk position in order to manage its net interest margin and net interest income 
the company results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
the company s asset and liability position ranged from neutral to slightly liability sensitive at december   depending on the interest rate assumptions applied to the simulation model employed by management to measure interest rate risk 
a neutral position results in similar amounts of change in interest income and interest expense resulting from application of assumed interest rate changes 
a slightly liability sensitive position results in a slightly larger change in interest expense than in interest income resulting from application of assumed interest rate changes 
simulation estimates depend on  and will change with  the size and mix of the actual and projected balance sheet at the time of each simulation 
management s interest rate risk management is currently biased toward stable interest rates in the near term  and ultimately  rising interest rates 
management continues to monitor the interest rate environment as well as economic conditions and other factors it deems relevant in managing the company exposure to interest rate risk 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk  even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the company board of directors 
market risk equity markets equity price risk can affect the company 
as an example  any preferred or common stock holdings  as permitted by banking regulations  can fluctuate in value 
management regularly assesses the extent and duration of any declines in market value  the causes of such declines  the likelihood of a recovery in market value  and its intent to hold securities until a recovery in value occurs 
declines in value of preferred or common stock holdings that are deemed other than temporary could result in loss recognition in the company income statement 
fluctuations in the company common stock price can impact the company financial results in several ways 
first  the company has regularly repurchased and retired its common stock  the market price paid to retire the company common stock can affect the level of the company shareholders equity  cash flows and shares outstanding 
second  the company common stock price impacts the number of dilutive equivalent shares used to compute diluted earnings per share 
third  fluctuations in the company common stock price can motivate holders of options to purchase company common stock through the exercise of such options thereby increasing the number of shares outstanding 
finally  the amount of compensation expense associated with share based compensation fluctuates with changes in and the volatility of the company common stock price 
market risk other market values of loan collateral can directly impact the level of loan charge offs and the provision for loan losses 
the financial condition and liquidity of debtors issuing bonds and debtors whose mortgages or other obligations are securitized can directly impact the credit quality of the company s investment portfolio requiring the company to recognize other than temporary impairment charges 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  are not significant in the normal course of the company business activities 
liquidity and funding the company routine sources of liquidity are operating earnings  investment securities  consumer and other loans  deposits  and other borrowed funds 
during  the company s operating activities generated million in liquidity providing adequate funds to pay common shareholders million in dividends and fund million in stock repurchases 
in  the company s operating activities generated million in liquidity providing funds to pay common shareholders million in dividends  fund million in stock repurchases and redeem million in subordinated debt 
in  loans provided million in liquidity from scheduled payments  paydowns and maturities  net of loan fundings 
the company purchased million in investment securities using million in cash and million from paydowns  maturities and sale of investment securities 
the company primarily purchased residential collateralized mortgage obligations and corporate securities to offset decreases in securities of us government sponsored entities 
other sources of cash from investing activities include proceeds of million under fdic loss sharing agreements and proceeds of million from sale of foreclosed assets 
cash was applied to reduce short term borrowings by million and to meet a net reduction in deposits totaling million 
in  investment securities provided million in liquidity from sales  paydowns and maturities  and loans provided million in liquidity from scheduled payments and maturities  net of loan fundings 
additionally  deposit growth increased cash million 
in  liquidity provided funds to purchase securities of million and to reduce short term borrowings by million and redeem a million subordinated debt 
at december   the company s assets included million in cash and amounts due from other banks from daily transaction settlements 
the bank maintains cash balances for its branches of approximately million to meet the routine needs of its customers 
further  the bank must maintain approximately million at the federal reserve bank frb to meet its reserve requirement  this reserve requirement is reduced by cash held for branches 
excluding cash for branch needs and cash required at the frb  cash and amounts due from other banks of approximately million provided excess liquidity  equivalent to ten percent of total deposits 
cash balances fluctuate regularly with deposit flows 
economic activity which causes noticeable deposit and cash flow fluctuations include monthly government transfer payments such as social security benefit payments  common payroll dates  and property and income tax payment cycles 
the fluctuation in deposit volumes directly affects available cash balances 
further  cash balances can be affected by loan and investment activity 
the company projects million in additional liquidity from investment security paydowns and maturities during the twelve months ending december  at december   million in residential collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and residential mortgage backed securities mbss were held in the company investment portfolios 
none of the cmos or mbss are backed by sub prime mortgages 
the residential cmos and mbss provided million in liquidity from paydowns during the three months ended december  at december   indirect automobile loans totaled million  which were experiencing stable monthly principal payments of approximately million during the fourth quarter of the company held billion in total investment securities at december  under certain deposit  borrowing and other arrangements  the company must hold and pledge investment securities as collateral 
at december   such collateral requirements totaled approximately million 
at december   million of the company investment securities were classified as available for sale  and as such  could provide additional liquidity if sold  subject to the company ability to meet continuing collateral requirements 
in addition  at december   the company had customary lines for overnight borrowings from other financial institutions of approximately million  under which was outstanding 
additionally  the company has access to borrowing from the federal reserve 
management expects the company could access additional long term debt financing if desired 
in management judgment  the company liquidity position is strong and asset liquidations or additional long term debt are considered unnecessary to meet the ongoing liquidity needs of the company 
management will monitor the company s cash levels throughout loan demand from credit worthy borrowers will be dictated by economic and competitive conditions 
the company aggressively solicits non interest bearing demand deposits and money market checking deposits  which are the least sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the growth of these deposit balances is subject to heightened competition  the success of the company sales efforts  delivery of superior customer service  new regulations and market conditions 
the company does not aggressively solicit higher costing time deposits  as a result  management anticipates such deposits will decline 
changes in interest rates  most notably rising interest rates  could impact deposit volumes 
depending on economic conditions  interest rate levels  and a variety of other conditions  deposit growth may be used to fund loans  reduce borrowings or purchase investment securities 
however  due to concerns such as uncertainty in the general economic environment  competition and political uncertainty  loan demand and levels of customer deposits are not certain 
shareholder dividends are expected to continue subject to the board discretion and continuing evaluation of capital levels  earnings  asset quality and other factors 
the company performs liquidity stress tests on a periodic basis to evaluate the sustainability of its liquidity
