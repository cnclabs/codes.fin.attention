overview during our fiscal year  we were one of the largest providers of optical components  modules and subsystems for the optical communications market 
we offer a differentiated solution that is designed to make it easier for our customers to do business by combining optical technology innovation  photonic integration and a vertically integrated approach to manufacturing and product development 
our customers include adva optical networking  alcatel lucent  ciena  cisco  coriant  ericsson  fiberhome technologies group  fujitsu  huawei  and tellabs  inc recent developments on september   we sold our oclaro switzerland gmbh subsidiary and associated laser diodes and pump business the zurich business to ii vi incorporated ii vi 
we received proceeds of million in cash on september  we will also receive million subject to hold back by ii vi until december  to address any post closing adjustments or claims  and million subject to a potential post closing working capital adjustment 
in addition  we retained approximately million in accounts receivable related to the zurich business and approximately million of supplier and employee related payables related to the zurich business which were not included in the oclaro switzerland gmbh subsidiary 
as part of the agreement  ii vi has purchased our switzerland subsidiary  which includes its gaas fabrication facility  and also the corresponding high power laser diodes  vcsel and nm pump laser product lines  including intellectual property  inventory  equipment and a related research and development facility in tucson  arizona  all of which are associated with this business 

table of contents we will continue the back end manufacturing of the nm pump and certain high power laser diode products at our shenzhen  china manufacturing facility and supply them to ii vi under a manufacturing services agreement 
the employees of shenzhen  china will continue to be employed by us 
in addition  various supply and transition service agreements have been established between the companies to ensure a smooth transition 
in addition  ii vi acquired an exclusive option to purchase our optical amplifier and micro optics business the amplifier business for million in cash 
the option to purchase our amplifier business  for which ii vi separately paid million in cash  will expire if not exercised within days 
if this option is exercised and ii vi purchases the amplifier business  the option price will be applied to the purchase price 
if ii vi does not exercise this option  we expect the million payment would be retained by us 
we received the million in cash proceeds on september  we have used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the zurich business to repay our term loan of million and will use a portion of the remaining proceeds to begin restructuring the company for the future 
we intend to further simplify our operating footprint  reduce our cost structure and focus our research and development investment in the optical communications market where we can leverage our core competencies 
oclaro  inc the parent is a party to the second amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of november  as amended  the credit agreement  among the parent  oclaro technology limited the borrower  each lender party thereto the lenders and wells fargo capital finance  inc  as administrative agent for the lenders the agent

such an acceleration can constitute see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our credit agreement and amendments to our credit agreement during fiscal year 
table of contents results of operations fiscal years ended june  and june  the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended june  and june   and the year over year increase decrease in our results  expressed both in dollar amounts thousands and as a percentage of revenues  except where indicated year ended increase decrease june  june  change thousands thousands thousands revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring  acquisition and related income expense  net n m flood related income expense  net n m impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets   n m gain on sale of property and equipment total operating expenses operating loss other income expense interest income expense  net gain loss on foreign currency translation n m other income expense  net n m gain on bargain purchase   n m total other income expense loss before income taxes income tax provision net loss not meaningful revenues revenues for the year ended june  increased by million  or percent  compared to the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of revenues in fiscal year generated through the acquisition of opnext on july  compared to the year ended june   revenues from sales of our gb s and gb s transmission modules increased by million  or percent  revenues from sales of our gb s transmission modules increased by million  or percent  revenues from sales of our transmission components decreased by million  or percent  revenues from sales of our amplification  filtering and optical switching products decreased by million  or percent  and revenues from sales of our industrial and consumer products increased by million  or percent 
the increase in revenue for these respective product groups was mainly attributable to our acquisition of opnext and also our recovery from the flooding in thailand 
however  we believe that market demand for our optical components was weaker during the year ended june  than the year ended june  our pro forma combined revenues including oclaro and opnext were approximately lower for the year ended june  than for the comparable period of the prior year 

table of contents for the year ended june   cisco accounted for million  or percent  of our revenues and huawei accounted for million  or percent  of our revenues 
for the year ended june   huawei accounted for million  or percent  and fujitsu accounted for million  or percent  of our revenues 
in fiscal year  we expect our revenues to decrease significantly as a result of the sale of our zurich business in september and our revenues could decrease further if we sell our amplifier business  in regards to which ii vi has an option to buy  in fiscal year the zurich business accounted for approximately percent of our fiscal year revenue 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues consists of the costs associated with manufacturing our products  and includes the purchase of raw materials  labor costs and related overhead  including stock based compensation charges and the costs charged by our contract manufacturers for the products they manufacture for us 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory are also included in cost of revenues 
costs and expenses related to our manufacturing resources incurred in connection with the development of new products are included in research and development expenses 
our cost of revenues for the year ended june  increased by million  or percent  compared to the year ended june  the increase was primarily related to higher costs associated with the inclusion of cost of revenues in fiscal year generated through the acquisition of opnext on july  in addition  we believe we experienced price erosion on our sales in excess of cost improvements in our products  we reassigned personnel from the flood in fiscal year  and we incurred higher excess and obsolete charges 
in fiscal year  we expect cost of revenues to decrease significantly as a result of the sale of our zurich business in september and the potential sale of our amplifier business  in regards to which ii vi has an option to buy  in fiscal year gross profit gross profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues 
gross margin rate is gross profit reflected as a percentage of revenues 
our gross margin rate decreased to percent for the year ended june   compared to percent for the year ended june  of the percentage points decline in gross margin rate  a decline of approximately percentage points was mainly attributable to product mix of our sales  with a higher mix of lower margin fixed wavelength gb s transmission products  and a decline of approximately percentage points was attributable to higher excess and obsolete inventory valuation charges 
the decrease in our gross margin rate was partially offset by the re assignment of certain of our manufacturing employees to efforts to restore our production capacity following the flood in thailand  which resulted in a million higher gross profit than would have otherwise been recorded for the year ended june   as these costs were included in flood related income expense during that period rather than being recorded in cost of revenues 
on a pro forma combined revenue basis  we experienced an approximately percent decline in sales of our products year over year  while many of our costs remained fixed and did not decline with our revenue  significantly impacting our gross margin rate 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research and design activities  including stock based compensation charges related to those employees  costs of design tools and computer hardware  costs related to prototyping and facilities costs for certain research and development focused sites 

table of contents research and development expenses increased by million  or percent  for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  the increase was primarily related to the inclusion of research and development expenses in fiscal year to fund research and development associated with products acquired through the acquisition of opnext on july   partially offset by a reduction in research and development expenses related to synergies from aligning and reducing combined research and development resources of oclaro and opnext in association with the merger  and other cost reduction efforts in response to softening market conditions and lower post flood revenues 
personnel related costs increased to million for the year ended june   compared with million for the year ended june   primarily as a result of an increase in personnel numbers following our acquisition of opnext 
in addition  for the year ended june   research and development expenses were million lower than they would have been otherwise as the redeployment of certain research and development personnel to flood recovery efforts  on a temporary basis during the recovery time period  have been included in flood related income expense in fiscal year other costs  including engineering materials  the costs of design tools and facilities related costs increased to million for the year ended june   compared with million for the year ended june  research and development expenses were favorably impacted by approximately million as a result of the fluctuations of the uk pound sterling  japanese yen and swiss franc relative to the us dollar 
in fiscal year  we expect research and development expenses to decrease approximately percent to percent compared with fiscal year as a result of the sale of our zurich business in september  the potential sale of our amplifier business  in regards to which ii vi has an option to buy  and restructuring actions we intend to announce in the first half of fiscal year to reduce our complexity and to simplify our operating footprint

selling  general and administrative expenses also include facilities expenses for sites which are not primarily focused on manufacturing or research and development 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  for the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  the increase was primarily related to the inclusion of selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year attributable to the operations of opnext  partially offset by a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses related to synergies from aligning and reducing combined selling  general and administrative resources of oclaro and opnext in association with the merger  and other cost reduction efforts in response to softening market conditions and lower post flood revenues 
personnel related costs increased to million for the year ended june   compared with million for the year ended june   primarily as a result of an increase in personnel numbers following our acquisition of opnext

selling  general and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by approximately million as a result of the fluctuations in the uk pound sterling  japanese yen and swiss franc relative to the us dollar 
in fiscal year  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease approximately percent to percent compared with fiscal year as a result of the sale of our zurich business in september  the potential sale of our amplifier business  in regards to which ii vi has an option to buy  and restructuring actions we intend to announce in the first half of fiscal year to reduce our complexity and to simplify our operating footprint 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the increase in our amortization is a result of our acquisition of opnext  for which we recorded million in intangible assets during the first quarter of fiscal year as our estimate of the fair value of acquired intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed our impairment analysis and concluded that based on the decline in our forecast  our decision to sell or abandon certain product lines and other factors  certain of our other intangible assets were impaired as of june  we recorded impairment losses of million related to intangibles acquired in connection with our acquisition of mintera  million related to intangibles acquired in connection with our acquisition of opnext  and million related to intangibles acquired in connection with other earlier acquisitions 
as a result of these impairments  we expect the amortization of intangible assets to decrease from million in fiscal year to million for fiscal years through based on the current level of our intangible assets 
restructuring  acquisition and related income expense  net in connection with the acquisition of opnext  during the year ended june   we recorded million in legal and professional fees  and initiated a restructuring plan to integrate the businesses

we do not expect to incur significant additional restructuring costs in connection with previously announced restructuring plans 
in addition  we incurred million of expenses during the year ended june   in external consulting charges associated with the optimization of past acquisitions as we focused on the associated infrastructure and processes required to support sustainable growth  including external costs associated with potential transactions to outsource our shenzhen manufacturing operations  which culminated in our transaction with venture 
we expect to incur significant restructuring expenses for incremental actions going forward  including restructuring actions we intend to announce in the first half of fiscal year to reduce our complexity and to simplify our operating footprint subsequent to the sale of the zurich business

this flooding had a material and adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
our primary contract manufacturer  fabrinet  suspended operations at two factories located in chokchai  thailand and pinehurst  thailand 
the chokchai factory suffered extensive flood damage and became inaccessible due to high water levels inside and surrounding the manufacturing facility

on may  we secured a short term bridge loan from providence equity of million 
in order to obtain this loan  we amended our credit agreement as defined in note to add providence as a term lender under that agreement 
in connection with this amendment  we agreed to complete certain asset sales and use the proceeds to repay amounts we have borrowed under the credit agreement 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the zurich business to fully repay all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
on september   we also sold an exclusive option to purchase the amplifier business for million 
we were separately paid million for the option  which will be applied to the purchase price if the option is exercised 
we can make no assurances that we will be successful concluding the sale of our amplifier business 
we have incurred significant operating losses and generated negative cash flows for fiscal year we currently anticipate that our net loss for the fiscal year will be substantial  further reducing the amount of cash available to us to fund our continued operations 
recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying balance sheet is dependent upon us having sufficient resources to operate our business 
in addition to the availability of our cash resources as of june   and the net proceeds from the sale of our zurich business  the continued operation of our business is dependent upon our achieving cash flows expected to be generated from the execution of our current operating plan  including anticipated restructuring plans together with i amounts expected to be available under our credit agreement after we conclude negotiations on new terms  and ii amounts anticipated to be received from the sale of the amplifier business  which we currently anticipate being completed by december the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue in existence 
in the event that any of the sources of liquidity described in the preceding paragraphs are  for any reason  not available to us in a timely manner or in the event that we need additional liquidity beyond our current expectations  such as to fund future growth or strengthen our balance sheet or to fund the cost of restructuring activities  we may find it necessary to lower our operating income break even level and undertake additional cost cutting measures 
we will continue to explore other sources of additional liquidity 
these additional sources of liquidity could include one  or a combination  of the following i issuing equity securities  ii incurring indebtedness secured by our assets  iii issuing debt and or convertible debt securities  or iv selling product lines  other assets and or portions of our business 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we fail to raise the additional cash required to fund our operations  we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
for additional information on the risks we face related to future cash requirements  see item a 
risk factors under risks related to our business we have a history of large operating losses and we may not be able to achieve profitability in the future and maintain sufficient levels of liquidity  note  business and summary of significant accounting policies basis of presentation  and the report of independent registered public accounting firm included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as of june   million of the million of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds are needed for our operations in the united states  we could be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not include repatriation of these funds 
risk management foreign currency risk as our business is multinational in scope  we are subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses 
we expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars  while a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in uk pounds sterling and the japanese yen 
our expenses denominated in the swiss franc will decrease significantly as a result of our sale of oclaro switzerland gmbh and the laser diodes and pump business in the first quarter of fiscal year fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar  the us pound sterling  the japanese yen and  to a lesser extent  other currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses could affect our operating results 
this includes the chinese yuan  the korean won and the euro in which we pay expenses in connection with operating our facilities in shenzhen and shanghai  china  daejeon  south korea and san donato  italy 
to the extent the exchange rate between the us dollar and these currencies were to fluctuate more significantly than experienced to date  our exposure would increase 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations between the us dollar and the us pound sterling  and we may be required to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
under certain circumstances  foreign currency forward exchange contracts can have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of june   we no longer had any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
as of june   we held three foreign currency forward exchange contracts with a notional value of million 
as of june   we recorded minimal unrealized gains in accumulated other comprehensive income in connection with marking these contracts to fair value 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations at june   by nature of the obligation and amount due over identified periods of time  are set out in the table below convertible notes capital lease obligations operating lease obligations sublease income purchase obligations thousands fiscal year thereafter amounts include interest 
the purchase obligations consist of our total outstanding purchase order commitments at june  any capital purchases to which we are committed are included in these outstanding purchase order commitments  with the exception of capital purchases made under capital leases  which are shown separately 
operating leases are future annual commitments under non cancelable operating leases  including rents payable for land and buildings 
off balance sheet arrangements we indemnify our directors and certain employees as permitted by law  and have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers 
we have not recorded a liability associated with these indemnification arrangements as we historically have not incurred any material costs associated with such indemnification obligations 
costs associated with such indemnification obligations may be mitigated by insurance coverage that we maintain  however  such insurance may not cover any  or may cover only a portion of  the amounts we may be required to pay 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain such insurance coverage in the future 
we also have indemnification clauses in various contracts that we enter into in connection with acquisitions and during the normal course of business  such as indemnifications in favor of customers in respect of liabilities they may incur as a result of purchasing our products should such products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party 
we have not historically paid out any material amounts related to these indemnifications  therefore  no accrual has been made for these indemnifications 
other than as set forth above  we are not currently party to any material off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from those based on our estimates and judgments or could have been materially different if we had used different assumptions  estimates or conditions 
in addition  our financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 

table of contents we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of such estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that the policies described below involve critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition and sales returns revenue represents the amounts  excluding sales taxes  derived from the sale of goods and services to third party customers during a given period 
specifically  we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped  title has transferred  collectability is reasonably assured  fees are fixed or determinable and there are no uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance 
for certain sales  we are required to determine  in particular  whether the delivery has occurred  whether items will be returned and whether we will be paid under normal commercial terms 
for certain products sold to customers  we specify delivery terms in the agreement under which the sale was made and assess each shipment against those terms  and only recognize revenue when we are certain that the delivery terms have been met 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded  which is netted against revenue 
these estimates for sales returns are based on historical sales return rates  other known factors and our return policy 
before accepting a new customer  we review publicly available information and credit rating databases to provide ourselves with reasonable assurance that the new customer will pay all outstanding amounts in accordance with our standard terms 
for existing customers  we monitor historic payment patterns and we perform ongoing credit evaluations to assess whether we can expect payment in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement under which the sale was made 
inventory valuation in general  our inventories are valued at the lower of cost to acquire or manufacture our products or market value  less write offs of inventory we believe could prove to be unsalable 
manufacturing costs include the cost of the components purchased to produce our products and related labor and overhead 
we review our inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if it is saleable 
products may be unsalable because they are technically obsolete due to substitute products  specification changes or excess inventory relative to customer forecasts 
we currently reduce the cost basis for inventory using methods that take these factors into account 
if we find that the cost of inventory is greater than the current market price  we will write the inventory down to the estimated selling price  less the estimated cost to complete and sell the product 
business combinations our acquisitions are accounted for pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations 
under asc topic  there are significant management estimates that impact our financial position and operating results  including tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date are recorded at the acquisition date fair value 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to the identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is recognized for any excess of purchase price over the net fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
a bargain purchase gain results if the fair value of the purchase price is less than the net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we recorded a million bargain purchase gain related to our acquisition of opnext during fiscal year 
table of contents for tangible assets acquired in any acquisition  such as plant and equipment  we estimate useful lives by considering comparable lives of similar assets  past history  the intended use of the assets and their condition 
in estimating the useful life of acquired intangible assets with definite lives  we consider the industry environment and specific factors relating to each product relative to our business strategy and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
acquired intangible assets primarily include core and current technology  patents  supply agreements  capitalized licenses and customer contracts 
we amortize our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods generally ranging from to years and  in the case of one specific customer contract  years 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable and that of a market participant 
for instance  in our mintera acquisition  we agreed to pay additional revenue based consideration whereby former security holders of mintera were entitled to receive up to million  determined based on a set of sliding scale formulas  to the extent revenue from mintera products is more than million in the months following the acquisition and or more than million in the months following the acquisition 
the estimated fair value of these obligations were determined using management estimates of the total amounts expected to be paid based on estimated operating results  discounted to their present value using our incremental borrowing cost 
our preliminary estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period for a business combination  which may be up to one year  we may record adjustments to the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
after the conclusion of the measurement period or our final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  subsequent adjustments affecting earnings are recorded within our consolidated statements of operations 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made significant adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisition of opnext upon the completion of our valuation 
see note  business combinations and asset dispositions  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  for additional information 
insurance recoveries insurance recoveries related to impairment losses previously recorded and other recoverable expenses will be recognized up to the amount of the related loss or expense in the period that recoveries become realizable 
insurance recoveries under business interruption coverage and insurance recovery gains in excess of amounts previously written off related to impaired inventory and equipment or in excess of other recoverable expenses previously recognized will be recognized when they become realizable and all contingencies have been resolved 
during the year ended june  and june   we received million and million in settlement payments  respectively  relating to losses we incurred due to the flooding in thailand 
as there were no contingencies associated with these payments  we recorded the payments within flood related income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
the evaluation of insurance recoveries requires estimates and judgments about future results which affect reported amounts and certain disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
insurance recoveries we receive in future periods will be recorded net of the related expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of june   we have not recorded any estimated amounts relating to potential future insurance recoveries in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested annually for impairment  in our case during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or more often if an event or circumstance suggests impairment has occurred 
in addition  we review identifiable intangibles  excluding goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we completed our annual first step analysis for potential impairment of our goodwill  which included examining the impact of current general economic conditions on our future prospects  the decline in our market capitalization  and the anticipated resizing of our operations with the recent sale of certain of our products and or businesses 
circumstances which could trigger an impairment test include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes to the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly below carrying value before the end of its estimated useful life 
the first step of testing goodwill for impairment is based on a reporting unit s fair value  which is generally determined through market prices 
in certain cases  due to the absence of market prices for a particular element of our business  we have elected to base our testing on discounted future expected cash flows 
although the discount rates and other input variables may differ  the model we use in this process is the same model we use to evaluate the fair value of acquisition candidates and the fairness of offers to purchase businesses that we are considering for divestiture 
the forecasted cash flows we use are derived from the annual long range planning process that we perform and present to our board of directors 
in this process  each reporting unit is required to develop reasonable sales  earnings and cash flow forecasts for the next three to seven years based on current and forecasted economic conditions 
for purposes of testing for impairment  the cash flow forecasts are adjusted as needed to reflect information that becomes available concerning changes in business levels and general economic trends 
the discount rates used for determining discounted future cash flows are generally based on our weighted average cost of capital and are then adjusted for plan risk the risk that a business will fail to achieve its forecasted results and country risk the risk that economic or political instability in the countries in which we operate will cause a business unit s projections to be inaccurate 
finally  a growth factor beyond the three to seven year period for which cash flows are planned is selected based on expectations of future economic conditions 
virtually all of the assumptions used in our models are susceptible to change due to global and regional economic conditions as well as competitive factors in the industry in which we operate 
unanticipated changes in discount rates from one year to the next can also have a significant effect on the results of the calculations 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions we use are reasonable  various economic factors could cause the results of our goodwill testing to vary significantly 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual first step analysis for potential impairment of our goodwill  which included examining the impact of current general economic conditions on our future prospects  the decline in our market capitalization  and the anticipated resizing of our operations with the recent sale of certain of our products and or businesses  and we concluded that the goodwill related to our mintera reporting unit was impaired 
we completed our full evaluation of the second step impairment analysis  which indicated that the goodwill was fully impaired and we recorded million for impairment losses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  in connection with our second step goodwill impairment analysis  we also evaluated the fair value of our other intangible assets of this reporting unit  and our other reporting units  and concluded that based on the decline in our forecast  our decision to sell or abandon certain product lines and other factors  certain of these other intangible assets were also impaired as of june  we recorded impairment losses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year of million related to intangibles acquired in connection with our acquisition of mintera  million related to intangibles acquired in connection with our acquisition of opnext  and million related to intangibles acquired in connection with other earlier acquisitions 
accounting for stock based compensation we recognize in our statement of operations all stock based compensation  including grants of employee stock options  grants of restricted stock and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan  based on their fair values on the grant dates 
estimating the grant date fair value of employee stock options and purchase rights requires us to make judgments in the determination of inputs into the black scholes merton valuation model which we use to arrive at an estimate of the fair value for such awards 
these inputs are based upon highly subjective assumptions as to the volatility of the underlying stock  risk free interest rates and the expected life of the options 
judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited during any given period 
as required under the accounting standards  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock options granted and purchase rights in future periods may change 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation expense and our consolidated results of operations could be materially impacted 
during the years ended june   june  and july   we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
see note  stock based compensation  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further information 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability based approach 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred income tax assets which are not likely to be realized 
recognition of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of these assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and the recorded cumulative net losses in all prior fiscal periods  we have provided a full valuation allowance against most of our us and foreign deferred tax assets with the exception of certain deferred tax assets in china and switzerland 
our valuation allowance increased by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
of the million increase  million relates to acquired opnext deferred tax assets upon which a full valuation allowance was recorded 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are our exposure to changes in interest rates and certain exchange rates 
we do not use risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates we finance our operations through a mixture of issuances of equity and debt securities  capital leases  working capital and by drawing on our credit facility 
we have exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our cash deposits and for amounts borrowed under our credit agreement  convertible notes  term loan and through our capital leases 
at june   there was million outstanding under our credit agreement at an average interest rate of percent per annum  million of convertible notes outstanding with an interest rate of percent  million term loan outstanding with an interest rate of percent  and million outstanding under capital leases 
an increase in our average interest rate by percent would increase our annual interest expense by million 
we monitor our interest rate risk on cash balances primarily through cash flow forecasting 
cash that is surplus to immediate requirements is invested in short term deposits with banks accessible with one day s notice and invested in overnight money market accounts 
foreign currency as our business is multinational in scope  we are subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates between the currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses 
in the future  we expect that a majority of our revenues will continue to be denominated in us dollars  while a significant portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in uk pounds sterling and japanese yen 
our expenses denominated in the swiss franc will decrease significantly as a result of our sale of the zurich business in the first quarter of fiscal year fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar  the us pound sterling  and the japanese yen and  to a lesser extent  other currencies in which we collect revenues and pay expenses  could affect our operating results 
this includes the chinese yuan  the korean won  the israeli shekel and the euro in which we pay expenses in connection with operating our facilities in shenzhen and shanghai  china  daejeon  south korea  jerusalem  israel and san donato  italy 
to the extent the exchange rate between the us dollar and these currencies were to fluctuate more significantly than experienced to date  our exposure would increase 

table of contents as of june   our uk subsidiary had million  net  in us dollar denominated operating intercompany payables  million in us dollar denominated accounts receivable and payable  net  related to sales to external customers and purchases from suppliers  and million in us dollar denominated cash accounts 
it is estimated that a percent fluctuation in the us dollar relative to the uk pound sterling would lead to a profit of million uk dollar strengthening  or loss of million us dollar weakening on the translation of these receivables and other cash balances  which would be recorded as gain loss on foreign exchange in our condensed consolidated statement of operations 
as of june   our japan subsidiary had million  net  in us dollar denominated operating intercompany payables  million in us dollar denominated accounts payable  net of accounts receivable  related to sales to external customers and purchases from suppliers  and million in us dollar denominated cash and restricted cash accounts 
it is estimated that a percent fluctuation in the us dollar relative to the japanese yen would lead to a profit of million us dollar weakening  or loss of million us dollar strengthening on the translation of these balances  which would be recorded as gain loss on foreign exchange in our consolidated statement of operations 
hedging program from time to time  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations between the us dollar and the us pound sterling 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to the chinese yuan  korean won  israeli shekel  japanese yen or the euro  but we may in the future if conditions warrant 
we also do not currently hedge our exposure related to our us dollar denominated intercompany payables and receivables 
we may be required to convert currencies to meet our obligations 
under certain circumstances  foreign currency forward exchange contracts can have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of june   we did not have any outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts
