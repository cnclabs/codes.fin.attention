you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements about our business and operations  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many important factors  including the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing interventional treatment systems for vascular disease 
our primary products  the stealth pad system the stealth  the diamondback pad system the diamondback  and the diamondback predator pad system the predator are catheter based platforms capable of treating a broad range of plaque types in leg arteries both above and below the knee and address many of the limitations associated with existing treatment alternatives 
we also are pursuing approval of our products for coronary use 
we refer to the stealth  diamondback  and the predator collectively in this report as the pad systems 
we were incorporated as replidyne  inc in delaware in on february   replidyne  inc completed its business combination with cardiovascular systems  inc  a minnesota corporation csi mn  in accordance with the terms of the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization  dated as of november  the merger agreement 
pursuant to the merger agreement  csi mn continued after the merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of replidyne 
replidyne changed its name to cardiovascular systems  inc csi and csi mn merged with and into csi  with csi continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation 
these transactions are referred to herein as the merger 
replidyne was a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing  in licensing and commercializing anti infective products 
csi was incorporated in minnesota in from to  we engaged in research and development on several different product concepts that were later abandoned 
since  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of the pad systems and since  to obtaining approval for a coronary application of our orbital technology 
from to  we conducted numerous bench and animal tests in preparation for application submissions to the fda 
we initially focused our testing on providing a solution for coronary in stent restenosis  but later changed the focus to peripheral artery disease  or pad 
in  we obtained an investigational device exemption from the fda to conduct our pivotal oasis clinical trial  which was completed in january the oasis clinical trial was a prospective center study that involved patients with lesions 
in august  the fda granted us k clearance for the use of the diamondback as a therapy in patients with pad 
we commenced commercial introduction of the diamondback in the united states in september we were granted k clearance of the predator in march and stealth in march we market the pad systems in the united states through a direct sales force and expend significant capital on our sales and marketing efforts to expand our customer base and utilization per customer 
we assemble at our facilities the saline infusion pump used with our stealth product and the single use catheter used in the pad systems with components purchased from third party suppliers  as well as with components manufactured in house 
supplemental products are purchased from third party suppliers 
we have developed modified versions of the stealth and diamondback to treat coronary arteries 
a coronary application requires us to conduct a clinical trial and file a premarket application  or pma  and obtain approval from the fda 
on march   we completed submission of our pma application to the fda for our orbital atherectomy system to treat calcified coronary arteries 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our losses to continue as we invest in sales  marketing  medical education  clinical studies and product research and development for our next phase of growth in the peripheral market and preparation for a potential coronary application 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock  convertible promissory notes  and debt 

table of contents financial overview revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of pad systems and other ancillary products 
the pad systems each use a disposable  single use  low profile catheter that travels over our proprietary viperwire guidewire 
the electric powered stealth pad system uses a saline infusion pump as a power supply for the operation of the catheter  while the air powered diamondback and predator pad systems use an external control unit that powers the system 
our ancillary products include the viperslide lubricant and vipertrack radiopaque tape 
we also have an exclusive distribution agreement with asahi to market its peripheral guide wire line in the united states 
cost of goods sold 
we assemble the single use catheter with components purchased from third party suppliers  as well as with components manufactured in house 
the infusion pump and guidewires are purchased from third party suppliers 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead

we also incur significant expenses to operate clinical trials  including trial design  third party fees  clinical site reimbursement  data management and travel expenses 
all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
approved patent applications are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over their remaining estimated lives 
patent amortization begins at the time of patent application approval  and does not exceed years 
interest and other income expense 
interest and other income expense primarily includes interest expense including premium and discount amortization  interest income  change in the fair value of the debt conversion option  debt refinancing costs  and net write offs upon debt conversion option and unamortized premium or discount

net write offs upon debt conversion option and unamortized premium or discount 
net write offs upon debt conversion option and unamortized premium are the result of the conversion of convertible debt  and include the write off of the related debt conversion option and any unamortized debt premium or discount 
other 
other consists of miscellaneous non operating expenses  including state taxes 
net operating loss carryforwards 
we have established valuation allowances to fully offset our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about our ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets  particularly in light of our historical losses 
the future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on us attaining profitable operations and will be limited in any one year under internal revenue code section due to significant ownership changes as defined in section resulting from our equity financings 
at june   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately million  which will expire at various dates through fiscal 
table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventory  the debt conversion option  and stock based compensation are updated as appropriate at least quarterly 
we use authoritative pronouncements  our technical accounting knowledge  cumulative business experience  valuation specialists  judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies 
while we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate  these estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome 
therefore  actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
some of our significant accounting policies require us to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
revenue recognition 
we sell the majority of our products via direct shipment to hospitals or office based labs 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record estimated sales returns  discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we have inventories that are principally comprised of capitalized direct labor and manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components  and finished goods 
due to the technological nature of our products  there is a risk of obsolescence to changes in our technology and the market  which is impacted by technological developments and events 
accordingly  we write down our inventories as we become aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions 
the evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  expected product lives  product at risk of expiration  sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand 
debt conversion option 
the fair value of the debt conversion option is related to the loan and security agreement with partners for growth and has been included as a component of debt conversion option and other assets on our balance sheet 
the monte carlo option pricing model used to determine the value of the debt conversion option includes various inputs including historical volatility  stock price simulations  and the assessed behavior of us and partners for growth based on those simulations 
stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments computed at the date of grant 
the fair value of all restricted stock awards and units are expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the related vesting period 
all restricted stock awards and units we have granted become exercisable over periods established at the date of grant 
the fair value of each restricted stock award and unit was equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant  as determined by management and the board of directors 
legal proceedings 
in accordance with fasb guidance  we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements related to legal proceedings when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other  the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if a loss is possible  but not known or probable  and can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in most cases  significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded

revenues increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to an million  or  increase in the number of pad systems sold and a million  or  increase in sales of supplemental and other revenue during the year ended june   compared to the year ended june  currently  all of our revenues are in the united states  however  we may potentially sell internationally in the future 
we expect our revenue to increase as we continue to increase the number of physicians using the devices and the usage per physician as we continue to focus on physician education programs  introduce new and improved products  and generate clinical data 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  these amounts represent the cost of materials  labor and overhead for single use catheters  guidewires  control units  pumps  and other supplemental products 
the decrease in gross margin from during the year ended june   to for the year ended june   was primarily due to a higher mix of stealth sales  which carries a higher unit cost than its predecessor product  and to lower average selling prices  partially offset by the favorable effect of increased production volumes 
cost of goods sold for the years ended june  and includes  and  respectively  for stock based compensation 
we expect that gross margin in fiscal will improve slightly compared to fiscal as cost improvements will be made throughout the year 
quarterly fluctuations could occur based on production volumes  timing of new product introductions  sales mix  pricing changes  or other unanticipated circumstances 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expense increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  have increased due to increased variable compensation  expansion in our sales and marketing organizations  increased medical education programs  and the medical device excise tax  which became effective january  and resulted in an expense of  for the year ended june  selling  general  and administrative expenses for the years ended june  and includes million and million  respectively  for stock based compensation 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as a result of the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing organization and programs to further commercialize our pad products and prepare for a potential future coronary application 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  research and development expenses relate to the development of new products  enhancement of existing products and pad and coronary clinical trials 
the increase in clinical expenses related to advancement of the orbit ii coronary trial and related expansion of the clinical organization 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  and include  and  respectively  for stock based compensation 
as we continue to expand our product portfolio within the market for the treatment of peripheral arteries and leverage our core technology into the coronary market  we generally expect to incur research and development expenses significantly above amounts incurred for the year ended june  fluctuations could occur based on the number of projects and studies and the timing of expenditures

the decrease in gross margin from during the year ended june  to for the year ended june  was primarily due to a higher mix of stealth sales  which currently carry higher unit costs than its predecessor products due to limited initial component purchasing volumes  and to reserves for inventory transitions 
also  the addition of our second manufacturing facility in texas for future production capacity temporarily increased production costs  but we believe will enhance efficiencies over time

table of contents non gaap financial information to supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap  our management uses a non gaap financial measure referred to as adjusted ebitda 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to the most comparable us gaap measure expressed as dollar amounts in thousands year ended june  loss from operations add stock based compensation add depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda the decrease in adjusted ebitda of million  or  is primarily the result of the million  or  increase in the loss from operations 
the loss from operations was significantly impacted by increases in operating expenses 
adjusted ebitda was also impacted by an increase in stock based compensation and increase in depreciation and amortization 
stock based compensation increased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  stock based compensation increased as a result of vesting of previously granted share awards with a higher grant date fair value  and the granting of performance based restricted stock awards with shorter vesting periods than service based awards 
depreciation and amortization increased as a result of additional investment in capital equipment and patents 
use and economic substance of non gaap financial measures used and usefulness of such non gaap financial measures to investors we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of performance and believe this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by depreciation and amortization expense and non cash charges such as stock based compensation 
our management uses adjusted ebitda to analyze the underlying trends in our business  assess the performance of our core operations  establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate our performance period over period and in relation to our competitors operating results 
we believe that presenting adjusted ebitda provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for its financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management 
we also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance 
adjusted ebitda is also used to measure performance in our financial covenants as required by silicon valley bank and partners for growth 
the following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from adjusted ebitda and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items stock based compensation 
we exclude stock based compensation expense from our non gaap financial measures primarily because such expense  while constituting an ongoing and recurring expense  is not an expense that requires cash settlement 
our management also believes that excluding this item from our non gaap results is useful to investors to understand its impact on our operational performance  liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the company  and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements 
depreciation and amortization expense 
we exclude depreciation and amortization expense from our non gaap financial measures primarily because such expenses  while constituting ongoing and recurring expenses  are not expenses that require cash settlement and are not used by our management to assess the core profitability of our business operations 
our management also believes that excluding these items from our non gaap results is useful to investors to understand our operational performance  liquidity and ability to make additional investments in the company 
material limitations associated with the use of non gaap financial measures and manner in which we compensate for these limitations non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with gaap 
some of the limitations associated with our use of these non gaap financial measures are 
table of contents items such as stock based compensation do not directly affect our cash flow position  however  such items reflect economic costs to us and are not reflected in our adjusted ebitda and therefore these non gaap measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items 
non gaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non gaap financial measures differently than we do  limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes 
our management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non gaap financial measures we use 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily upon our gaap results and using non gaap financial measures only supplementally 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at june  and  respectively 
during the year ended june   net cash used in operations amounted to million

this term loan also includes an acceleration provision that requires us to pay the entire outstanding balance  plus a penalty ranging from to of the commitment amount  upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default 
the balance outstanding on the term loan at june   was million net of the unamortized discount associated with warrants issued to silicon valley bank in connection with the loan 
the unamortized discount associated with warrants and other fees paid to the lender are being amortized over the month maturity period 
the million line of credit expires on june  and has a floating interest rate equal to the wall street journal prime rate  plus  with an interest rate floor of

we may also effect at any time a mandatory conversion of amounts  subject to certain terms  conditions and limitations provided in the agreement  including a requirement that the ten day volume weighted average price of our common stock prior to the date of conversion is at least greater than the conversion price 
we may reduce the conversion price to a price that represents a discount to the ten day volume weighted average price of our common stock to satisfy this condition and effect a mandatory conversion
