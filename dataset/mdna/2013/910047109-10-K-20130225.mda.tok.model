merger integration on may   ual corporation  continental  and jt merger sub inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ual corporation  entered into an agreement and plan of merger providing for a merger of equals business combination 
on october   jt merger sub inc merged with and into continental  with continental surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ual corporation the merger 
upon closing of the merger  ual corporation became the parent company of both united and continental and ual corporation s name was changed to united continental holdings  inc ual s consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of continental and its subsidiaries for the period subsequent to october  
table of contents integration related accomplishments include the company made significant progress in integrating its products  services  policies and a number of information technology systems 
following the conversion of its passenger service system in march  the company now has a single loyalty program  mileageplus  and a single website  united 
com 
continental s onepass loyalty program formally ended in the first quarter of  at which point united automatically enrolled onepass members in the mileageplus program and deposited into those mileageplus accounts award miles equal to onepass members award miles balance 
as a result of the conversion to a single passenger service system  the company now operates using a single reservations system  carrier code  flight schedule  website and departure control system  the company continued to redeploy aircraft across its global network  better matching aircraft and demand on a route by route basis  and the united and continental pilots represented by the air line pilots association  international alpa ratified a new joint collective bargaining agreement with the company 
some key initiatives for the company in include maintaining reliable operational performance  investing in customer service training and tools for its frontline co workers  completing the installation of flat bed seats in the premium cabins of its international widebody aircraft  installing global satellite based wifi on approximately of its mainline aircraft  and reaching competitive joint collective bargaining agreements with its union represented employee groups 
see notes and to the financial statements included in item of this report and item a  risk factors  for additional information on the merger 
operations network 
the company transports people and cargo through its mainline operations  which use jet aircraft with at least seats  and its regional operations 
see item  properties  for a description of the company s mainline and regional aircraft 
with key global air rights in the us  asia pacific  europe  middle east  africa  and latin america  ual has the world s most comprehensive global route network 
ual  through united and continental and their regional carriers  operates more than  daily flights to more than us and international destinations from the company s hubs at newark liberty international airport newark liberty  chicago o hare international airport chicago o hare  denver international airport denver  george bush intercontinental airport houston bush  hopkins international airport cleveland hopkins  los angeles international airport lax  ab won pat international airport guam  san francisco international airport sfo and washington dulles international airport washington dulles 
all of the company s domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers  contributing to a large amount of origin and destination traffic 
our hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly 
our hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft 
as discussed under alliances below  united is a member of star alliance  the world s largest airline network 
regional 
the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express 
these regional operations are an extension of the company s mainline network 
this regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft 
chautauqua airlines  republic airlines republic  commutair airlines  expressjet airlines  gojet airlines  mesa airlines  shuttle america  skywest airlines skywest and trans states airlines trans states are all regional carriers  which operate most of their capacity under capacity purchase agreements with united and or 
table of contents continental 
under these capacity purchase agreements  the company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees carrier controlled costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment for superior operational performance based on agreed performance metrics 
the fees for carrier controlled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers  such as crew expenses  maintenance and aircraft ownership  some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg  block hours  departures while others are fixed monthly amounts 
under these capacity purchase agreements  the company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees  facilities rent and other costs  which are passed through by the regional carrier to the company without any markup 
in return  the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for united and or continental  on schedules determined by the company 
the company also determines pricing and revenue management  assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats  and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its mileageplus program 
while the regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements comprise more than of all regional flights  the company also has prorate agreements with hyannis air service  inc cape air  silver airways silver  skywest and trans states 
under these commercial flying agreements  the company and its regional carriers agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula  while both the company and its regional carriers are individually responsible for their own costs of operations 
unlike capacity purchase agreements  under a prorate agreement  the regional carrier retains the control and risk of scheduling  and in most cases  market selection  local seat pricing and inventory for its flights  although the company and its regional carriers may coordinate schedules to maximize connections 
financial information on the company s operating revenues by geographic regions  as reported to the us department of transportation the dot  can be found in note to the financial statements included in item of this report 
alliances 
united and continental have a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines  which enhance travel options for customers by providing greater time of day coverage to common destinations  additional mileage accrual and redemption opportunities  and access to markets that united and continental do not serve directly 
these marketing alliances typically include one or more of the following features loyalty program reciprocity  codesharing of flight operations whereby seats on one carrier s selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier  coordination of reservations  ticketing  passenger check in  baggage handling and flight schedules  and other resource sharing activities 
united is a member of star alliance  a global integrated airline network co founded by united in and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world 
as of january   star alliance carriers served  airports in countries with over  daily flights 
current star alliance members  in addition to united  are adria airways  aegean airlines  air canada  air china  air new zealand  all nippon airways  asiana airlines  austrian airlines  avianca taca airlines  brussels airlines  copa airlines  croatia airlines  egyptair  ethiopian airlines  lot polish airlines  lufthansa  sas scandinavian airlines  shenzhen airlines  singapore airlines  south african airways  swiss  tam airlines  tap portugal  thai airways international  turkish airlines and us airways 
star alliance has announced that eva air will be a future star alliance member 
on february   us airways announced an agreement to merge with amr corporation and its intent to exit star alliance as a result of such merger 
united  continental  air canada and the lufthansa group which includes lufthansa and its affiliates austrian airlines  brussels airlines and swiss participate in a joint venture agreement covering trans atlantic routes 
the joint venture  which enables the carriers to integrate the services they operate between the united states and europe and to capture revenue synergies  delivers highly competitive flight schedules  fares and services 
the joint venture has a revenue sharing structure that will result in payments among participants based on a formula that compares current period unit revenue performance on trans atlantic routes to a historic period  or baseline  which is reset annually 
the payments are calculated on a quarterly basis and are subject to a cap 
see industry regulation below 
the european commission  which has been conducting a standard review of the competitive effects of the joint venture  has not yet completed its review

the payments will be calculated on a quarterly basis and are subject to an annual cap 
in  united  continental and air canada entered into a memorandum of understanding to establish a revenue sharing trans border joint venture 
the parties subsequently drafted a joint venture agreement based on the trans atlantic joint venture agreement among united  continental  air canada and the lufthansa group 
on october   united  continental and air canada reached a consent agreement with the canadian competition bureau settling litigation related to the proposed joint venture which will allow its implementation and full coordination among the parties  with certain exceptions on a limited number of non stop routes 
united  continental and air canada already have us antitrust immunity 
a definitive joint venture agreement has not yet been finalized 
united and continental currently maintain independent marketing agreements with other air carriers including aeromar  aer lingus  cape air  eva air  great lakes airlines  silver  hawaiian airlines  island air  and jet airways 
in addition  united offers a train to plane alliance with amtrak from newark liberty to select regional destinations 
loyalty program 
united s mileageplus program builds customer loyalty by offering awards and services to program participants 
members in this program earn mileage credit for flights on united  continental  united express  airlines in star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the program 
members can also earn miles by purchasing the goods and services of our network of non airline partners  such as credit card issuers  retail merchants  hotels and car rental companies 
members can redeem mileage credits for free  discounted or upgraded travel and non travel awards 
under the company s consolidated amended and restated co branded card marketing services agreement dated june  the co brand agreement with chase bank usa  na chase  loyalty program members accrue frequent flyer miles for making purchases using co branded credit cards issued by chase 
the co brand agreement provides for joint marketing of the company s credit card program and provides chase with other benefits such as permission to market to the company s customer database 
in  million mileageplus travel awards were used on united and continental 
these awards represented and of united s and continental s total revenue passenger miles in  respectively 
total miles redeemed for travel on united and continental in  including class of service upgrades  represented of the total miles redeemed 
in addition  excluding miles redeemed for travel on united and continental  mileageplus members redeemed miles for approximately million awards in as compared to million in these non united and non continental travel awards include united club memberships  car and hotel awards  merchandise and travel on another air carrier 
the decrease in the number of non united and non continental travel awards redeemed in compared to was due to a decrease in hotel  car and united club redemptions 
fuel 
aircraft fuel has been the company s single largest and most volatile operating expense for the last several years 
the table below summarizes ual s aircraft fuel consumption and expense during the last three years 
year gallons consumed in millions fuel expense in millions average price per gallon percentage of total operating expense a b   
table of contents a calculation excludes special charges identified in note to the financial statements included in item of this report 
b excludes fuel consumption and cost for continental predecessor prior to october  the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affect the company s operations  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
to provide adequate supplies of fuel  the company routinely enters into short term and long term purchase contracts and has some ability to store fuel close to its major hub locations 
to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel  the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements 
the company generally uses commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including heating oil  diesel fuel and crude oil 
third party business 
united has third party business revenue that includes fuel sales  catering  ground handling  maintenance services and frequent flyer award non air redemptions  and third party business revenue is recorded in other revenue 
the company has a contract to sell aircraft fuel to a third party which is earnings neutral but results in revenue and expense  specifically cost of sale which is unrelated to the operation of the airline 
united also incurs third party business expenses  such as maintenance  ground handling and catering services for third parties  fuel sales and non air mileage redemptions  and those third party business expenses are recorded in other operating expenses 
distribution channels 
the majority of the company s airline seat inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global distribution systems gds 
the growing use of the company s direct sales website  united 
com  the company s mobile applications and alternative distribution systems  provides the company with an opportunity to de commoditize its services  better control its content  make more targeted offerings  better retain its customers  enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs 
to encourage customer use of lower cost channels and capitalize on these cost saving opportunities  the company will continue to expand the capabilities of its website and mobile applications and explore alternative distribution channels 
industry conditions domestic competition 
the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic 
currently  any us carrier deemed fit by the dot is free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the united states 
the company s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and  to a lesser extent  other forms of transportation 
competition can be direct  in the form of another carrier flying the exact non stop route  or indirect  where a carrier serves the same two cities non stop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport 
air carriers cost structures are not uniform and there are numerous factors influencing cost structure 
carriers with lower costs may deliver lower fares to passengers  which could have a potential negative impact on the company s revenues 
in addition  future airline mergers  acquisitions or reorganizations pursuant to chapter of the united states bankruptcy code may enable airlines to improve their revenue and cost performance relative to peers and thus enhance their competitive position within the industry 
decisions on domestic pricing are based on intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines 
in order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels  we often find it necessary to match competitors discounted fares 
since we compete in a dynamic marketplace  attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares oftentimes fail 
international competition 
internationally  the company competes not only with us airlines  but also with foreign carriers 
international competition has increased and may increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances  restructurings  liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors 
competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation 
the company s ability to compete successfully with non us carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network 
table of contents worldwide 
foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries 
in addition  in the absence of open skies and fifth freedom rights  us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements and restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments 
to compensate partially for these structural limitations  us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances  joint ventures and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other s flights and route networks 
see alliances  above  for further information 
seasonality 
the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters  driving higher revenues  than in the first and fourth quarters  which are periods of lower travel demand 
industry regulation domestic regulation general 
all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot 
absent an exemption  no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity 
the dot also grants international route authority  approves international codeshare arrangements  and regulates methods of competition 
the dot regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising  denied boarding compensation  tarmac delays  and baggage liability  and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future 
airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration the faa  an agency within the dot  primarily in the areas of flight safety  air carrier operations  and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness 
the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates  prescribes maintenance procedures  oversees airport operations  and regulates pilot and other employee training 
from time to time  the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect or modify aircraft and other equipment  potentially causing the company to incur substantial  unplanned expenses 
the airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations 
the us department of homeland security dhs has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security 
see legislation  below 
the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters 
the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail 
labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act rla  a federal statute 
the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot  faa  doj and other us and international regulatory bodies 
airport access 
access to landing and take off rights  or slots  at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are  or recently have been  subject to government regulation 
federally mandated domestic slot restrictions currently apply at reagan national airport in washington dc washington reagan  john f 
kennedy international airport jfk  laguardia airport laguardia and newark liberty 
in addition  to address concerns about airport congestion  the faa has designated certain airports  including newark liberty  jfk  and laguardia as high density traffic airports and has imposed operating restrictions at these three airports  which may include capacity reductions 
additional restrictions on airline routes and takeoff and landing slots may be proposed in the future that could affect the company s rights of ownership and transfer 
legislation 
the airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs 
in addition to significant federal  state and local taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to  proposed taxes and fees are currently pending that may increase the company s operating costs if imposed on the company 
congress may pass legislation that could increase labor and operating costs 
recently  congress has enacted two laws  the airline safety and federal aviation extension act of and the faa modernization and reform act of  which have increased regulation and are likely to cause increased costs in the areas of 
table of contents airline safety  pilot training  and consumer protection 
climate change legislation is also likely to be a significant area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely impact the company s costs 
see environmental regulation  below 
in december  the dot issued the first of several rules intended to enhance airline passenger protections 
the rule included regulations mandating that major air carriers  including united and continental  adopt detailed contingency plans and implement procedures applicable to tarmac delays exceeding three hours for domestic flights and four hours for international flights  subject to exceptions for safety and security 
in april  the dot issued a second set of consumer protection regulations 
this second initiative imposed regulations requiring carriers to charge the same baggage fee throughout a passenger s entire itinerary even if on multiple carriers and expanded the scope of the tarmac delay rule to cover foreign carriers operating to and from the united states 
although the dot delayed the enforcement date for its new baggage fee regulations until july  it is now in force and could expose united to dot enforcement action and civil penalties 
in december  the faa issued a final rule amending the existing flight  duty  and rest regulations applicable to us air carriers operating under part of the federal aviation regulations 
the provisions under the final rule are likely to negatively impact the company s operations and increase the company s costs by mandating extensive changes to the way we schedule crews and deploy aircraft 
moreover  in december  the faa issued a draft policy statement proposing to cede authority over some areas of cabin crewmember workplace safety and health condition oversight to the occupational safety and health administration 
if this change in policy is finalized  it would expose the company to increased regulatory requirements in the aircraft cabin  with the potential for increased costs and adverse operational impacts 
finally  aviation security continues to be the subject of frequent legislative and regulatory action  requiring changes to the company s security processes  frequently increasing the cost of its security procedures  and adversely affecting its operations 
international regulation general 
international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation 
in connection with the company s international services  the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries the company serves 
in addition  the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments  and in some cases  fares and schedules require the approval of the dot and or the relevant foreign governments 
legislation 
foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws  rules and regulations that meet or exceed us requirements 
in cases where this activity exceeds us requirements  additional burden and liability may be placed on the company 
the european union eu now requires compensation to passengers for canceled and delayed flights  in addition to denied boarding compensation 
similar foreign regulations require passenger compensation and subject the company to enforcement penalties in addition to changes in operating procedures 
airport access 
historically  access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved 
these agreements regulate the markets served  the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers flights 
since the early s  the us has pursued a policy of open skies meaning all us flag carriers have access to the destination  under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets 
currently  there are more than open skies agreements in effect 
however  many of the airports that the company serves in europe  asia and latin america maintain slot controls 
a large number of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports 
london heathrow international airport  frankfurt rhein main airport  shanghai pudong international airport  beijing capital international airport  sao paulo guarhulos international airport  tokyo narita international airport and haneda international airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to capacity limitations 
as an example  under the united states japan open skies agreement  only four slot pairs are available in haneda to us air carriers at this time  none of which is held by the company 

table of contents the company s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments 
shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements 
depending on the nature of any such change  the value of the company s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 
environmental regulation general 
the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal  state  local and international environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air  discharges to surface and subsurface waters  safe drinking water  aircraft noise  and the management of hazardous substances  oils and waste materials 
areas of either proposed regulations or implementation of new regulations include regulations surrounding the emission of greenhouse gases discussed further below  state of california regulations regarding air emissions from ground support equipment  and a federal rule making seeking to regulate airport fuel hydrant systems under the underground storage tank regulations 
climate change 
there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company  including the eu emissions trading scheme eu ets which is subject to international dispute  environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom s air passenger duty and germany s departure ticket tax  limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements  and the state of california s cap and trade regulations which impacts united s san francisco maintenance center 
in addition  there are land based planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects  requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions  and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 
in  the eu issued a directive to member states to include aviation in its greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme 
the application of the eu ets to aviation  including the requirement for foreign airlines to surrender carbon allowances for emissions occurring outside of the eu airspace  has been the subject of significant international dispute among countries  with more than forty non eu countries having gone on record opposing the scheme 
on november   the eu announced a one year stay of the requirements for international flights to the eu  which the eu attributed to recent progress by the international civil aviation organization icao towards a global regulatory program to regulate aviation greenhouse gas emissions 
on november   the president of the united states signed the european union emissions trading scheme prohibition act of  which encourages the dot to seek an international solution through the icao  and if necessary  prohibit us airlines from participation in the eu ets and take other actions to hold the airlines harmless from the scheme 
the future of the eu ets legislation as applied to international flights into europe is uncertain but the company will continue to monitor developments 
the precise cost to the company should the scheme apply to international flights in the future is difficult to calculate due to a number of variables  including the company s future carbon emissions with respect to flights to and from the eu  the price of carbon credits  and whether the dot will take action to prohibit us airlines from participation in the scheme and hold us airlines harmless from such scheme 
the eu ets stay has increased international attention in its focus on the icao process with the intent to reach an international agreement that would apply to international aviation and prohibit the application of regional schemes 
without an international agreement  there could be other regulatory actions taken in the future by the us government  state governments within the us  or foreign governments  to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry  which could result in multiple schemes applying to the same emissions 
the precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict  but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant  including the potential for increased fuel costs  carbon taxes or fees  or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 

table of contents the company is taking various actions to reduce its carbon emissions through fleet renewal  aircraft retrofits  and actions that are establishing the foundation for the commercialization of aviation biofuels 
other environmental matters 
some us and foreign airports have established airport restrictions to limit noise  including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number and scheduling of hourly or daily operations 
in some instances  these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increased operating costs  and could limit our ability to expand our operations at the affected airports 
the airline industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations that require the company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives and which may require significant expenditures 
under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  commonly known as superfund  and similar environmental cleanup laws  generators of waste materials and owners or operators of facilities can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions 
the company also conducts voluntary environmental assessment and remediation actions 
environmental cleanup obligations can arise from  among other circumstances  the operation of aircraft fueling facilities and primarily involve airport sites 
future costs associated with these activities are currently not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
employees as of december   ual  including its subsidiaries  had approximately  employees 
as of december   united had approximately  employees and continental had approximately  employees 
approximately of the combined company s employees were represented by various us labor organizations as of december  collective bargaining agreements between the company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the rla  which governs labor relations in the air transportation industry 
such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date  upon which the contract is considered open for amendment 
the process for integrating the represented employee groups of united and continental is governed by a combination of the rla  the mccaskill bond amendment  and where applicable  the existing provisions of united s and continental s collective bargaining agreements and union policies 
under the rla  the national mediation board nmb has exclusive authority to resolve union representation disputes arising out of airline mergers 
under the mccaskill bond amendment  fair and equitable integration of seniority lists is required  including arbitration where the interested parties cannot reach a consensual agreement  consistent with the process set forth in the allegheny mohawk labor protective provisions or internal union merger policies  if applicable 
pending operational integration  the company will apply the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements unless other terms have been negotiated 
during  various labor agreements were reached between union representatives and the company 
on december   the pilots for both united and continental ratified a joint collective bargaining agreement with the company 
in february  the company reached tentative agreements on new joint collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists iam for the fleet service  passenger service and storekeeper workgroups at the united  continental  continental micronesia and mileage plus subsidiaries 
the tentative agreements with the iam cover more than  employees and are subject to ratification by the iam members 
we are also currently in the process of negotiating joint collective bargaining agreements with all of our other major represented groups 
several other collective bargaining agreements were reached with unions at each of our subsidiaries during  including with the united flight attendants in february  the continental micronesia aircraft technicians in may  the continental pilot ground instructors in june and the continental micronesia flight attendants in august

item a 
risk factors 
the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company s business and the forward looking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time 
any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results  financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this report 
the merger may present certain material risks to the company s business and operations 
the merger  described in item  business  may present certain risks to the company s business and operations including  among other things  risks that we may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses and workforces of united and continental  we may be unable to successfully manage the expanded business with respect to monitoring new operations and associated increased costs and complexity  we may be unable to avoid potential liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the merger and integration  including in connection with any legal merger of united air lines  inc and continental airlines  inc 
into a single corporation  we may be unable to successfully manage the complex integration of systems  technology  aircraft fleets  networks and other assets of united and continental in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact on the company and the company s customers  vendors  suppliers  employees and other constituencies  and we may experience disruption of  or inconsistencies in  each of united s and continental s standards  controls  reports on operations  procedures  policies and services 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the merger will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies  innovation and operational efficiencies that we currently expect  that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated timeframe or that we will be able to fully and accurately measure any such synergies 
continued periods of historically high fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results  financial position and liquidity 
aircraft fuel has been the company s single largest and most volatile operating expense for the last several years 
the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affect the company s operations  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
while the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of fuel under various supply contracts and also stores fuel close to major hub locations to ensure supply continuity in the short term  the company cannot predict the continued future availability or price of aircraft fuel 
continued volatility in fuel prices may negatively impact the company s liquidity in the future 
aircraft fuel prices can fluctuate based on a multitude of factors including market expectations of supply and demand balance  inventory levels  geopolitical events  economic growth expectations  fiscal monetary policies and financial investment flows 
the company may not be able to increase its fares or other fees if fuel prices rise in the future and any such fare or fee increases may not be sustainable in the highly competitive airline industry 
in addition  any increases in fares or other fees may not sufficiently offset the full impact of such rises in fuel prices and may also reduce the general demand for air travel 
to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel  the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements 
however  the company s hedging program may not be successful in controlling fuel costs  and price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions and other factors 
to the extent that the company uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if prices decline significantly  including swaps or sold put options as 
table of contents part of a collar  such hedge contracts may limit the company s ability to benefit from lower fuel costs in the future 
if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into a hedge contract  we may be required to post collateral margin with our hedge counterparties beyond certain thresholds 
also  lower fuel prices may result in increased industry capacity and lower fares in general 
there can be no assurance that the company s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the company s hedging arrangements 
additionally  deterioration in the company s financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future and may potentially require the company to post increased amounts of collateral under its fuel hedging agreements 
in addition  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act and regulations promulgated by the commodity futures trading commission cftc introduce new requirements for centralized clearing for over the counter derivatives 
this may include the company s fuel hedge contracts 
the ual board of directors has approved the company s election of the cftc s end user exception  which permits the company as a non financial end user of derivatives to hedge commercial risk and be exempt from the cftc mandatory clearing requirements 
however  depending on the final regulations adopted by the cftc and other regulators  several of the company s hedge counterparties may be subject to requirements which may raise their costs 
those increased costs may in turn be passed to the company  resulting in increased transaction costs to execute hedge contracts and lower credit thresholds to post collateral margin 
see note to the financial statements included in item of this report for additional information on the company s hedging programs 
economic and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general economic and industry conditions 
the airline industry is highly cyclical  and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies 
robust demand for our air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions  including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies  low unemployment levels  strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit 
air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times 
in addition  during periods of unfavorable economic conditions  business travelers usually reduce the volume of their travel  either due to cost saving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel 
during such periods  the company s business and results of operations may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand  particularly with respect to the company s business and premium cabin travelers  and a reduction in fare levels 
stagnant or worsening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions  and any future volatility in us and global financial and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and liquidity 
if such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future  the company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments 
the company is subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally 
the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives approximately of its operating revenues  as measured and reported to the dot 
the company s operations in asia  europe  latin america  africa and the middle east are a vital part of its worldwide airline network 
volatile economic  political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives 
in addition  significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies  and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions  may have a material adverse impact upon the company s liquidity  revenues  costs and operating results 

table of contents the company may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity 
the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations  including aircraft lease and debt financings  leases of airport property and other facilities  and other material cash obligations 
in addition  the company has substantial non cancelable commitments for capital expenditures  including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 
although the company s cash flows from operations and its available capital  including the proceeds from financing transactions  have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date  the company s future liquidity could be negatively impacted by the risk factors discussed in this item a  including  but not limited to  substantial volatility in the price of fuel  adverse economic conditions  disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events 
if the company s liquidity is constrained due to the various risk factors noted in this item a or otherwise  the company s failure to comply with certain financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements  timely pay its debts  or comply with other material provisions of its contractual obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences  including the acceleration of the company s indebtedness  increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements  the withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers and the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
furthermore  constrained liquidity may limit the company s ability to withstand competitive pressures and limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including increased competition and demand for new services  placing the company at a disadvantage when compared to its competitors that have less debt  and making the company more vulnerable than its competitors who have less debt to a downturn in the business  industry or the economy in general 
the company s substantial level of indebtedness and non investment grade credit rating  as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness  may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms  or at all 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further information regarding the company s liquidity 
certain of the company s financing agreements have covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries 
certain of the company s credit facilities and indentures governing its secured notes impose certain operating and financial covenants on the company  on united and its subsidiaries  or on continental and its subsidiaries 
such covenants require the company  united or continental  as applicable  to maintain  depending on the particular agreement  minimum fixed charge coverage ratios  minimum liquidity and or minimum collateral coverage ratios 
a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where the company  united or continental  as applicable  may not be able to maintain the required collateral coverage ratio 
in addition  the credit facilities and indentures contain other negative covenants customary for such financings 
the company s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control  including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs  and the company may be required to seek waivers or amendments of covenants  repay all or a portion of the debt or find alternative sources of financing 
the company cannot provide assurance that such waivers  amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or  if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company fails to comply with these covenants and is unable to obtain a waiver or amendment  an event of default would result which would allow the lenders  among other things  to declare outstanding amounts due and payable 
the company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such amounts if they were to become due 
in addition  an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities or indentures could also result in an event of default under certain of the company s other financing agreements due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions 

table of contents extensive government regulation could increase the company s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 
airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight 
compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company 
laws  regulations  taxes and airport rates and charges  both domestically and internationally  have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue 
the company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and regulations  or laws or regulations enacted in the future  will not adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 
each of united and continental provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot 
if the dot altered  amended  modified  suspended or revoked these certificates  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the dot is also responsible for promulgating consumer protection and other regulations that may impose significant compliance costs on the company 
the faa regulates the safety of united s and continental s operations 
united and continental are operators pursuant to a single air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa 
from time to time  the faa also issues orders  airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company 
these faa orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design  manufacturing  maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action 
for example  on january   the faa announced a review of the boeing aircraft s critical systems and in service issues and  on january   the faa issued an emergency airworthiness directive that requires us boeing operators  including the company  to temporarily cease operations of such aircraft 
if the directive were to continue for an extended period of time  it could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
faa requirements cover  among other things  retirement of older aircraft  security measures  collision avoidance systems  airborne windshear avoidance systems  noise abatement and other environmental concerns  aircraft operation and safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft 
these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated air traffic control atc system utilized by the us government 
during peak travel periods in certain markets  the current atc system s inability to handle existing travel demand has led to short term capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic 
in addition  the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth 
imposition of these atc constraints on a long term basis may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
failure to update the atc system in a timely manner  and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the airline industry is subject to extensive federal  state and local taxes and fees that increase the cost of the company s operations 
in addition to taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to  proposed taxes and fees are currently pending and if imposed  would increase the company s operating expenses 
access to landing and take off rights  or slots  at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are  or recently have been  subject to government regulation 
certain of the company s major hubs are among increasingly congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights and or increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day 
the faa may limit the company s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports  which could affect the company s ownership and transfer rights  and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to its facilities  which could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the faa historically has taken actions with respect to airlines slot holdings that airlines have challenged  if the faa were to take actions to adversely affect the company s slot holdings  the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots 
further  the company s operating costs at airports at which it operates  including the company s major hubs  may increase 
table of contents significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund  directly or indirectly 
in some circumstances  such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the company s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between airports in the us and other countries may be subject to change 
applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time  government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised  and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change 
the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements  regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes  the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes  the airports at which carriers may operate international flights  or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports 
any further limitations  additions or modifications to such arrangements  regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
additionally  if an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of the company s international routes  such an event could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets 
in addition  competition from revenue sharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the company s business and assets on the open skies routes 
the company s plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied 
many aspects of the company s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal  state  local and international laws protecting the environment 
future environmental regulatory developments  such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry 
there are certain climate change laws and regulations that have already gone into effect and that apply to the company  including the eu ets which is subject to international dispute  the state of california s cap and trade regulations  environmental taxes for certain international flights  limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and land use planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 
in addition  there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry 
the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict  but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 
see item  business industry regulation above  for further information on government regulation impacting the company 
the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 
the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business  including computerized airline reservation systems  flight operations systems  telecommunication systems and commercial websites  including www 
united 
com 
united s website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight and schedule information  as well as process critical financial transactions 
these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to events including natural disasters  power failures  terrorist attacks  equipment or software failures  computer viruses or cyber security attacks 
substantial or repeated website  reservation systems or telecommunication systems failures or disruptions  including failures or disruptions related to the company s integration of technology systems  could reduce the attractiveness of the company s services versus those of its competitors  materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights  result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information  and result in increased costs  lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data 

table of contents the company s business relies extensively on third party service providers 
failure of these parties to perform as expected  or interruptions in the company s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company  could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company has engaged an increasing number of third party service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business  including regional operations  operation of customer service call centers  distribution and sale of airline seat inventory  provision of information technology infrastructure and services  provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs  provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations  among other vital functions and services 
the company does not directly control these third party service providers  although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance 
any of these third party service providers  however  may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company or agreements with such providers may be terminated 
for example  flight reservations booked by customers and or travel agencies via third party gdss may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators 
such disruptions  including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation  may cause the carriers flight information to be limited or unavailable for display  significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users  and impair the company s relationships with its customers and travel agencies 
the failure of any of the company s third party service providers to adequately perform their service obligations  or other interruptions of services  may reduce the company s revenues and increase its expenses or prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers 
in addition  the company s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 
ual s obligations for funding continental s defined benefit pension plans are affected by factors beyond ual s control 
continental has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its us employees  other than the employees of its chelsea food services division and continental micronesia  inc the timing and amount of ual s funding requirements under continental s plans depend upon a number of factors  including labor negotiations with the applicable employee groups and changes to pension plan benefits as well as factors outside of ual s control  such as the number of applicable retiring employees  asset returns  interest rates and changes in pension laws 
changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase ual s funding requirements  such as its liquidity requirements  could have a material adverse effect on ual s financial condition 
union disputes  employee strikes or slowdowns  and other labor related disruptions  as well as the integration of the united and continental workforces in connection with the merger  present the potential for a delay in achieving expected merger synergies  could adversely affect the company s operations  and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance 
united and continental are both highly unionized companies 
as of december   the company and its subsidiaries had approximately  active employees  of whom approximately were represented by various us labor organizations 
the successful integration of united and continental and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combined company depend in part on integrating united and continental employee groups and maintaining productive employee relations 
in order to fully integrate the pre merger represented employee groups  the company must negotiate a joint collective bargaining agreement covering each combined group 
the process for integrating the labor groups of united and continental is governed by a combination of the rla  the mccaskill bond amendment  and where applicable  the existing provisions of each company s collective bargaining agreements and union policy 
a delay in or failure to integrate the united and continental employee groups presents the potential for delays in achieving expected merger synergies  increased operating costs and labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations 
during  various labor agreements were reached between union representatives and the company 
on december   the pilots for both united and continental ratified a joint collective bargaining agreement 
table of contents with the company 
in february  the company reached tentative agreements on new joint collective bargaining agreements with the iam for the fleet service  passenger service and storekeeper workgroups at the united  continental  continental micronesia and mileage plus subsidiaries 
the tentative agreements with the iam cover more than  employees and are subject to ratification by the iam members 
we are also currently in the process of negotiating joint collective bargaining agreements with all of our other major represented groups 
several other collective bargaining agreements were reached with unions at each of our subsidiaries during  including with the united flight attendants in february  the continental micronesia aircraft technicians in may  the continental pilot ground instructors in june and the continental micronesia flight attendants in august the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of labor negotiations for all amendable collective bargaining agreements will be achieved 
there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the merger 
employee dissatisfaction with the results of the seniority integration may lead to litigation that in some cases can delay implementation of the integrated seniority list 
there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slow downs  work to rule campaigns  sick outs or other actions designed to disrupt united s and continental s normal operations  in an attempt to pressure the companies in collective bargaining negotiations 
although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to self help  and united and continental can seek injunctive relief against premature self help  such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined 
in addition  achieving joint collective bargaining agreements  including the pilot agreement  with our represented employee groups is likely to increase our labor costs  which increase could be material 
the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition 
in recent years  the market share held by low cost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase 
the increased market presence of low cost carriers  which engage in substantial price discounting  has diminished the ability of large network carriers to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes 
airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity  including route systems and the number of markets served 
several of the company s domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves  causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations 
in addition  the company and certain of its competitors have implemented significant capacity reductions in recent years in response to high and volatile fuel prices and stagnant global economic growth 
further  certain of the company s competitors may not reduce capacity or may increase capacity  impacting the expected benefit to the company from capacity reductions 
this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
the airline industry may undergo further bankruptcy restructuring  industry consolidation  or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to bankruptcy restructuring  industry consolidation  and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures 
a number of carriers have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years and other domestic and international carriers could restructure in bankruptcy or threaten to do so in the future to reduce their costs 
most recently  amr corporation  the parent company of american airlines  inc  filed for bankruptcy protection in november and is currently under going a restructuring under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
carriers operating under bankruptcy protection can operate in a manner that could be adverse to the company and could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors 
both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions 
on february   us airways announced an agreement to merge with amr corporation 
table of contents and its intent to exit star alliance as a result of such merger 
the company is also facing stronger competition from expanded airline alliances and joint ventures 
carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances  slot swaps  and or joint ventures 
certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes  pool revenues and costs  and enjoy other mutual benefits  achieving many of the benefits of consolidation 
open skies agreements  including the agreements between the united states and the european union and between the united states and japan  may also give rise to additional consolidation or better integration opportunities among international carriers 
there is ongoing speculation that further airline consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future 
the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position  including alliances  asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities 
if other airlines participate in such activities  those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities  thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the company s ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 
increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
following the terrorist attacks on september   the company s insurance costs increased significantly and the availability of third party war risk terrorism insurance decreased significantly 
the company has obtained third party war risk terrorism insurance through a special program administered by the faa 
should the government discontinue this coverage  obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms  if such coverage is available at all 
if the company is unable to obtain adequate third party war risk terrorism insurance  its business could be materially and adversely affected 
if any of the company s aircraft were to be involved in an accident or if the company s property or operations were to be affected by a significant natural catastrophe or other event  the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance including aviation hull and liability insurance and property and business interruption coverage to cover such liabilities or losses  whether due to insurance market conditions or otherwise  its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the company could experience adverse publicity  harm to its brand  reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident  catastrophe  or incident involving its aircraft  the aircraft of its regional carriers or the aircraft of its codeshare partners  which may result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
an accident  catastrophe  or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates  or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the company s regional carriers  could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident  catastrophe  or incident created a public perception that the company s operations  or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers  are not safe or reliable  or less safe or reliable than other airlines 
such public perception could in turn result in adverse publicity for the company  cause harm to the company s brand and reduce travel demand on the company s flights  or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers 
in addition  any such accident  catastrophe  or incident could expose the company to significant tort liability 
although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident or catastrophe  and the company s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations  if the company s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it  the company could incur substantial losses from an accident  catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 

table of contents the company s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 
due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months  revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year  which are periods of lower travel demand 
the company s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality  but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including  among others  the imposition of excise and similar taxes  extreme or severe weather  air traffic control congestion  geological events  natural disasters  changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation  general economic conditions and other factors 
as a result  the company s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
terrorist attacks or international hostilities  or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities  even if not made directly on the airline industry  could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 
the terrorist attacks on september  involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted each of united s and continental s financial condition and results of operations  as well as the prospects for the airline industry 
among the effects experienced from the september  terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faa imposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry s fleet  significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience  increased insurance costs  substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue 
additional terrorist attacks  even if not made directly on the airline industry  or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry 
wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the company s financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities 
an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial position and results of operations 
an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat that affects travel demand or travel behavior  or travel restrictions or reduction in the demand for air travel caused by an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat in the future  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its long lived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  the company is required to test its indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october of each year  or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
in addition  the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
the company may be required to recognize impairments in the future due to  among other factors  extreme fuel price volatility  tight credit markets  a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets  unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment  as well as other uncertainties 
the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period 
the value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft 
such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers 
an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 

table of contents the company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances  including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock  or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 
as of december   ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately billion 
the company s ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an ownership change as defined in section section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation s stock by more than percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period  which is generally the three year period preceding any potential ownership change 
there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards 
potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock  including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of the company s convertible debt  repurchase of such debt with ual common stock  issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning or more of ual common stock  or a combination of such transactions  may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section under section  a future ownership change would subject the company to additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of pre ownership change nols that may be used to offset post ownership change taxable income 
this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporation s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused annual limitation may  subject to certain limits  be carried over to later years  and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by built in gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change 
this limitation could cause the company s us federal income taxes to be greater  or to be paid earlier  than they otherwise would be  and could cause all or a portion of the company s nol carryforwards to expire unused 
similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes 
the company s ability to use its nol carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods 
its nol carryforwards may expire before the company can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full 
ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits certain transfers of its stock which could have an effect on the market price of ual common stock 
to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the company s ability to use its nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a ownership limitation 
this limitation generally remains effective until february   or until such later date as may be approved by the ual board of directors the board of directors in its sole discretion 
the limitation prohibits i an acquisition by a single stockholder of shares that results in that stockholder owning or more of ual common stock and ii any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns or more of ual common stock  unless prior written approval is granted by the board of directors 
any transfer of common stock in violation of these restrictions will be void and will be treated as if such transfer never occurred 
this provision of ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder and adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell ual common stock 
in addition  this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company  creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial  which could also adversely affect the market price of the ual common stock 
the company cannot predict the effect that this provision in ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market price of the ual common stock 
for additional information regarding the ownership limitation  please refer to ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation available on the company s website 

table of contents certain provisions of ual s governance documents could discourage or delay changes of control or changes to the board of directors 
certain provisions of ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws together  the governance documents may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of its stockholders may consider beneficial 
certain provisions of the governance documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if the board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of ual and its stockholders 
these provisions of the governance documents are not intended to prevent a takeover  but are intended to protect and maximize the value of ual s stockholders interests 
while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of ual to negotiate with the board of directors  they could enable the board of directors to prevent a transaction that some  or a majority  of its stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or  they could prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 
the issuance of additional shares of ual s capital stock  including the issuance of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes and upon a noteholder s exercise of its option to require ual to repurchase convertible notes  could cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 
ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes up to one billion shares of common stock 
in certain circumstances  ual can issue shares of common stock without stockholder approval

item legal proceedings 
brazil air cargo investigation in april  brazilian antitrust authorities initiated an administrative proceeding in order to verify the existence of a cartel among certain airlines for the determination and implementation of a fuel surcharge  including united and its cargo manager 
on january   the economic law secretariat of brazil issued its opinion recommending that civil penalties be assessed against all parties being investigated  including united  to the administrative counsel of economic defense cade  which is charged with making a determination on the matter 
on august   the brazil federal public prosecutor issued an opinion to cade recommending the dismissal of the proceedings against united and its cargo manager  which is currently under consideration by cade 
united continues to vigorously defend itself before cade 
united is currently cooperating with cade s investigation and continues to analyze whether any potential liability may result 
based on its evaluation of all information currently available  united has determined that no reserve for potential liability is required and will continue to defend itself against all allegations that it was aware of or participated in cartel activities 
however  penalties for violation of competition laws can be substantial and an ultimate finding that united engaged in improper activity could have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
united injunction against alpa and four individual defendants for unlawful slowdown activity under the railway labor act on july   united filed a lawsuit in the united states federal court for the northern district of illinois seeking a preliminary injunction against alpa and four individual pilot employees for unlawful concerted activity that was disrupting the company s operations 
the court granted the preliminary injunction to united in november  which was upheld by the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
alpa and united reached an agreement to discontinue the ongoing litigation over united s motion for a permanent injunction and  instead  the preliminary injunction remained in effect until the conclusion of the ongoing bargaining process for an amended collective bargaining agreement that began on april  on december   the pilots ratified a new collective bargaining agreement and  on december   the district court vacated the preliminary injunction and the underlying case was dismissed with prejudice 

table of contents eeoc claim under the americans with disabilities act on june   the us equal employment opportunity commission eeoc filed a lawsuit on behalf of five named individuals and other similarly situated employees alleging that united s reasonable accommodation policy for employees with medical restrictions does not comply with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act 
the eeoc maintains that qualified disabled employees should be placed into available open positions for which they are minimally qualified  even if there are better qualified candidates for these positions 
under united s accommodation policy  employees who are medically restricted and who cannot be accommodated in their current position are given the opportunity to apply and compete for available positions 
if the medically restricted employee is similarly qualified to others who are competing for an open position  under united s policy  the medically restricted employee will be given a preference for the position 
if  however  there are candidates that have superior qualifications competing for an open position  then no preference will be given 
united successfully transferred the venue of the case to the united states federal court for the northern district of illinois 
following the district court s dismissal of the matter and the eeoc s subsequent appeal to the seventh circuit court of appeals  on september   the seventh circuit overruled previous precedent and held that there may be an obligation to place a minimally qualified disabled worker in a position over a more qualified non disabled worker 
after the case was remanded to district court and the district court s grant of united s motion to stay this mandate during appeal  united filed a petition for certiorari with the supreme court of the united states the supreme court on december  united anticipates that the eeoc will file its response brief with the supreme court on march   after which the supreme court will determine whether to accept the case 
litigation associated with september  terrorism families of victims of the september   terrorist attacks filed lawsuits asserting a variety of claims against the airline industry 
united and american airlines the aviation defendants  as the two carriers whose flights were hijacked on september   are the central focus of the litigation  but a variety of additional parties  including continental  have been sued on a number of legal theories ranging from collective responsibility for airport screening and security systems that allegedly failed to prevent the attacks to faulty design and construction of the world trade center towers 
world trade center properties  inc  as lessee  also filed claims against the aviation defendants and the port authority of new york and new jersey the port authority  the owner of the world trade center  for property and business interruption damages 
the port authority has also filed cross claims against the aviation defendants in both the wrongful death litigation and for property damage sustained in the attacks 
the insurers of various tenants at the world trade center filed subrogation claims for damages as well 
by statute  these matters were consolidated in the us district court for the southern district of new york and the aviation defendants exposure was capped at the limit of the liability coverage maintained by each carrier at the time of the attacks 
in september  united settled the last remaining wrongful death claim in connection with this matter 
in  insurers for the aviation defendants reached a settlement with all of the subrogated insurers and most of the uninsured plaintiffs with property and business interruption claims  which was approved by the court and has been affirmed by the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
the us district court for the southern district of new york dismissed a claim for environmental cleanup damages filed by a neighboring property owner  cedar washington associates  llc 
this dismissal order has been appealed to the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
in january  continental was dismissed from the litigation in its entirety 
in the aggregate  claims related to the events of september  are estimated to be well in excess of billion 
the company believes that it will have no financial exposure for claims arising out of the events of september  in light of the provisions of the air transportation safety and system stabilization act of limiting claimants recoveries to insurance proceeds  the resolution of the wrongful death and personal injury cases by settlement  the resolution of the majority of the property damage claims and the withdrawal of all related proofs of claim from ual corporation s chapter bankruptcy proceeding 

table of contents antitrust litigation related to the merger transaction on june   forty nine purported purchasers of airline tickets filed an antitrust lawsuit in the us district court for the northern district of california against continental and ual corporation in connection with the merger 
the plaintiffs alleged that the merger may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in the transportation of airline passengers in the united states and the transportation of airline passengers to and from the united states on international flights  in violation of section of the clayton act 
on august   the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction pursuant to section of the clayton act  seeking to enjoin the merger 
on september   the court denied the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction  which allowed the merger to close 
after the closing of the merger  the plaintiffs appealed the court s ruling to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit and moved for a hold separate order pending the appeal  which was denied 
the ninth circuit affirmed the district court s denial of the preliminary injunction on may  and  on july   denied the plaintiffs motions for rehearing and for rehearing en banc 
the us supreme court thereafter denied certiorari 
on october   the district court allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint in order to  among other things  add a claim for damages 
continental and united filed a motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice which the district court granted on december  the plaintiffs are appealing that dismissal 
the company has determined that no reserve for potential liability is required and will continue to defend itself against the claim 
environmental proceedings in  the california regional water quality control board crwqcb mandated a field study of the area surrounding continental s aircraft maintenance hangar in los angeles 
the study was completed in september and identified aircraft fuel and solvent contamination on and adjacent to this site 
in april  continental began environmental remediation of aircraft fuel contamination surrounding its aircraft maintenance hangar pursuant to a workplan submitted to and approved by the crwqcb and its landlord  the los angeles world airports 
additionally  continental could be responsible for environmental remediation costs primarily related to solvent contamination on and near this site 
continental accrued a reserve in an amount expected by the company to cover environmental remediation costs for this site 
other legal proceedings the company is involved in various other claims and legal actions involving passengers  customers  suppliers  employees and government agencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
additionally  from time to time  the company becomes aware of potential non compliance with applicable environmental regulations  which have either been identified by the company through internal compliance programs such as its environmental compliance audits or through notice from a governmental entity 
in some instances  these matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions 
after considering a number of factors  including but not limited to the views of legal counsel  the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience  management believes that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies will not materially affect its consolidated financial position or results of operations

see item a  risk factors  and the factors described under forward looking information for further discussion of these and other factors that could affect us 
merger integration 
during  the company made significant progress in integrating its products  services  policies and a number of information technology systems 
following the conversion of its passenger service system in march  the company now has a single passenger service system  a single loyalty program  mileageplus  and a single website  united 
com 
continental s onepass loyalty program formally ended in the first quarter of  at which point united automatically enrolled onepass members in the mileageplus program and 
table of contents deposited into those mileageplus accounts award miles equal to onepass members award miles balance 
as a result of the conversion to a single passenger service system  the company now operates using a single reservations system  carrier code  flight schedule  website and departure control system 
the company continued to redeploy aircraft across its global network  better matching aircraft and demand on a route by route basis 
the united and continental pilots represented by the air line pilots association  international alpa ratified a new joint collective bargaining agreement with the company 
some key initiatives for the company in include maintaining reliable operational performance  investing in customer service training and tools for its frontline co workers  completing the installation of flat bed seats in the premium cabins of its international widebody aircraft  installing global satellite based wifi on approximately of its mainline aircraft  and reaching competitive joint collective bargaining agreements with its union represented employee groups 
ual expects the merger to deliver billion to billion in net annual synergies on a run rate basis when the integration is complete and synergy benefits are fully realized 
the company has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the merger 
the company incurred approximately million of integration related cash costs in and expects this amount to decrease significantly in to approximately million 
there are many factors that could affect the total amount or the timing of those expenses  and many of the expenses that will be incurred are  by their nature  difficult to estimate accurately 
see notes and to the financial statements included in item of this report and item a  risk factors  for additional information on the merger 
the company plans to merge united air lines  inc and continental airlines  inc into one legal entity in once this legal merger occurs  the financial statements of united and continental will be combined at their historical cost for all periods presented beginning on october   the date on which continental became a wholly owned subsidiary of ual  and there will no longer be a requirement to separately report the historical financial statements of continental 
economic conditions 
the economic outlook for the aviation industry in is characterized by stagnant to modest us and global economic growth 
we cannot predict whether the demand for air travel will improve or the rate of such improvement 
continuing economic uncertainty  including continued european sovereign debt uncertainty and political and socioeconomic tensions in regions such as the middle east  may result in diminished demand for air travel and may impair our ability to achieve profitability in capacity 
over the past year  ual leveraged the flexibility of its combined fleet to better match market demand and added new routes from its hubs to international destinations such as istanbul  turkey  manchester  england  dublin  ireland  buenos aires  argentina  monterrey  mexico  san salvador  el salvador  kelowna  british columbia  canada  and doha  qatar via dubai  united arab emirates 
in addition  for  ual expects to add new routes from its hubs to taipei  taiwan  shannon  ireland  paris  france  edmonton  alberta  canada  fort mcmurray  alberta  canada  thunder bay  ontario  canada  and denver s first service to asia with non stop service to tokyo  subject to government approval 
we expect consolidated capacity for to be lower than consolidated capacity in should fuel prices increase significantly or should us or global economic growth outlooks decline substantially  we would likely adjust our capacity plans to reflect the different operating environment 
fuel costs 
fuel prices continued to be volatile in ual s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was in as compared to in if fuel prices rise significantly from their current levels  we may be unable to raise fares or other fees sufficiently to fully offset our increased costs 
in addition  high fuel prices may impair our ability to achieve profitability 
based on projected fuel consumption in  a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change ual s annual fuel expense by approximately million 
to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel  the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements 

table of contents labor costs 
as of december   the company had approximately of employees represented by unions 
we are in the process of negotiating amended collective bargaining agreements with our major employee groups 
the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups  although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements would have an adverse financial impact on the company 
in  the company expects casm  excluding fuel  profit sharing and third party business expense to increase to year over year  of which approximately percentage points are due to collective bargaining agreements with various employee groups 
results of operations in this section  we compare ual s results of operations for the year ended december  with ual s results of operations for the year ended december  this presentation differs from the comparison of and results  which compares ual s financial performance year over year excluding the merger impact in  represented by continental successor results in the fourth quarter of non gaap financial measures are presented because they provide management and investors with the ability to measure and monitor ual s performance on a consistent basis

table of contents consolidated passenger revenue in increased approximately million  or  as compared to this increase was due to an increase of in both average fare per passenger and yield  over the same period as a result of improved pricing primarily from industry capacity discipline  offset by a decline in passengers 
the reduced traffic from both business and leisure passengers in was offset by higher fares  which drove improvements in both average fare per passenger and yield 
cargo revenue decreased by million  or  in as compared to due to excess industry capacity and a weaker demand environment 
both cargo volume and yield declined in compared to freight revenue in decreased compared to due to lower volume  fuel surcharges and processing fees

the increase was offset by a decrease in profit sharing and lower workers compensation and long term disability 
distribution expenses decreased million  or  in as compared to due to reduced fees with our online ticket agents  lower credit card discount fees driven by legislation reducing costs on debit card sales  and lower volume of global distribution fees paid

certain of the company s financing agreements have covenants that impose certain operating and financial restrictions  as applicable  on the company  on united and its material subsidiaries  or on continental and its subsidiaries 
among other covenants  ual  united and certain of united s subsidiaries are guarantors under the amended credit facility and are required to maintain the minimum of the following as set forth below unrestricted cash balance at all times as defined in the amended credit facility billion ratio of collateral value to debt obligations that may increase if a specified dollar value of the route collateral is released to fixed charge coverage ratio for twelve month periods measured at the end of each calendar quarter to additionally  the revolving credit facility requires the company to maintain the minimum of the following as set forth below unrestricted liquidity at all times includes unrestricted cash  short term investments and any undrawn amounts under any revolving credit facility billion ratio of appraised value of collateral to the outstanding obligations under the revolving credit facility to among other covenants  the indenture governing continental s senior secured notes due the senior notes requires the issuer to maintain a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations as of certain reference periods 
if the value of the collateral underlying the senior notes declines such that continental no longer maintains the minimum required ratio of collateral value to debt obligations  continental may be required to pay additional interest at the rate of per annum  provide additional collateral to secure the noteholders lien or repay a portion of the senior notes 

table of contents the amended and restated indenture for the new pbgc notes  which are unsecured  contains covenants that  among other things  restrict the ability of ual and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends on or repurchase stock 
these covenants cease to be in effect when the indenture covering the senior notes is discharged 
however  if ual at that time or thereafter has a series of public debt securities with a principal amount of million or more that has the benefit of covenants that are substantially similar to those contained in the indenture for the new pbgc notes  then subject to certain conditions and upon written request of the pbgc to ual  ual and united will use commercially reasonable efforts to amend the indenture for the new pbgc notes to include such covenants 
a breach of certain of the covenants or restrictions contained in the amended credit facility  the revolving credit facility  the indenture governing the senior notes or certain other debt instruments could result in a default and a subsequent acceleration of the applicable debt obligations 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains a cross default provision that would be triggered if continental were to fail to make payment when due with respect to certain obligations regarding frequent flyer miles purchased by chase under the company s co brand agreement 
the revolving credit facility includes events of default customary for similar financings

the company has agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services 
under certain of the company s credit card processing agreements  the financial institutions either require  or under certain circumstances have the right to require  that the company maintains a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that has been processed by that financial institution  but for which the company has not yet provided the air transportation 
such financial institutions may require additional cash or other collateral reserves to be established or additional withholding of payments related to receivables collected if the company does not maintain certain minimum levels of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company s current level of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is substantially in excess of these minimum levels 
capital commitments and off balance sheet arrangements 
the company s business is capital intensive  requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets  particularly aircraft 
in the past  the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase  by issuing debt  by entering into capital or operating leases  or through vendor financings 
the company also often enters into long term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal  cargo  maintenance and other required facilities

contingencies continental eetcs 
in october  continental created two pass through trusts  one of which issued million aggregate principal amount of class a pass through certificates with a stated interest rate of and the second of which issued million aggregate principal amount of class b pass through certificates with a stated interest rate of 
the proceeds of the issuance of the class a and class b pass through certificates  which amounted to million  are used to purchase equipment notes issued by continental 
of the million in proceeds raised by the pass through trusts  continental received million as of december   continental expects to receive the remaining proceeds from the issuance during the first seven months of as aircraft are delivered to continental and continental issues equipment notes to the trusts 
continental records the debt obligation upon issuance of the equipment notes rather than upon the initial issuance of the pass through certificates 
the proceeds have been and are expected to be used to fund the acquisition of new aircraft 
in december  continental created one pass through trust which issued million aggregate principal amount of class c pass through certificates with a stated interest rate of 
the proceeds of the issuance of the class c pass through certificates are used to purchase equipment notes issued by continental related to the aircraft financed in both the march and october eetc financings

continental records the debt obligation upon issuance of the equipment notes rather than upon the initial issuance of the pass through certificates 
the company evaluated whether the pass through trusts formed are variable interest entities vies required to be consolidated by the company under applicable accounting guidance  and determined that the pass through trusts are vies 
the company determined that it does not have a variable interest in the pass through trusts 
the company does not invest in or obtain a financial interest in the pass through trusts 
rather  continental has an obligation to make interest and principal payments on its equipment notes held by the pass through trusts 
the company did not intend to have any voting or non voting equity interest in the pass through trusts or to absorb variability from the pass through trusts 
based on this analysis  the company determined that it is not required to consolidate the pass through trusts 
legal and environmental 
the company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business 
management believes  after considering a number of factors  including but not limited to the information currently available  the views of legal counsel  the nature of contingencies to 
table of contents which the company is subject and prior experience  that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
these amounts are recorded based on the company s assessments of the likelihood of their eventual disposition 
many aspects of the company s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal  state and local and international laws protecting the environment 
future environmental regulatory developments  such as climate change regulations in the us and abroad  could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry 
there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company  including the european union emissions trading scheme which is subject to international dispute  environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom s air passenger duty and germany s departure ticket tax  limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements  and the state of california s cap and trade regulations which impacts united s san francisco maintenance center 
in addition  there are land based planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects  requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions  and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 
off balance sheet arrangements 
an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements 
the company s primary off balance sheet arrangements include operating leases  which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in capital commitments and off balance sheet arrangements  above  and certain municipal bond obligations  as discussed below 
as of december   united had cash collateralized million of letters of credit  most of which had previously been issued under the amended credit facility 
united also had million of performance bonds 
continental had letters of credit and performance bonds relating to various real estate  customs and aircraft financing obligations at december  in the amount of approximately million 
most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the performance bonds have expiration dates through as of december   united and continental are the guarantors of approximately million and billion  respectively  in aggregate principal amount of tax exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon 
these bonds  issued by various airport municipalities  are payable solely from rentals paid under long term agreements with the respective governing bodies 
the leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases and are not recorded in united s and continental s financial statements 
the leasing arrangements associated with a minority of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases 
the annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table in capital commitments and off balance sheet arrangements  above 
increased cost provisions 
in the company s financing transactions that include loans  the company typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and  in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on libor  for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law  subject in most cases to certain mitigation obligations of the lenders 
at december   ual had billion of floating rate debt consisting of united s billion and continental s million of debt and million of fixed rate debt consisting of united s million and continental s million of debt  with remaining terms of up to ten years  that are subject to these increased cost provisions 
in several financing transactions involving loans or leases from non us entities  with remaining terms of up to nine years and an aggregate balance of billion consisting of united s billion and continental s million balance  we bear the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to non us entities to withholding taxes  subject to customary exclusions 

table of contents fuel consortia 
the company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage 
interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage 
the consortia and in limited cases  the participating carriers have entered into long term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax exempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds  issued by various local municipalities 
in general  each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds 
as of december   approximately billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which ual participates  as to which ual and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt 
as of december   ual s contingent exposure was approximately million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation 
as of december   united s and continental s contingent exposure related to these bonds  based on its recent consortia participation  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases 
the guarantees will expire when the tax exempt bonds are paid in full  which range from to the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made 
united and continental cash flows activities compared to united operating activities united s cash from operating activities decreased by million in as compared to this year over year decrease was primarily due to united s net income being billion lower in than which was largely offset by an increase in advance ticket sales and receivables 
investing activities united s capital expenditures  including aircraft purchase deposits  were million and million in and  respectively 
united s capital expenditures in related to upgrades to existing aircraft in addition to asset improvements to facilities and other ground equipment

continental operating activities continental s cash from operating activities decreased by million in as compared to the period 
this year over year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in receivables and advance ticket sales 
investing activities continental s capital expenditures  including aircraft purchase deposits  were billion and million in and  respectively 
consistent with ual s investing activities above  continental s capital expenditures in relate to the purchase of new boeing aircraft and other fleet related expenditures to improve the onboard experience of our existing aircraft

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions 
the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 
passenger revenue recognition 
the value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales 
the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united and continental as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage 
tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines 
non refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight  unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date 
fees charged in association with changes or extensions to non refundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is collected 
the fare on the changed ticket  including any additional collection  is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided 
change fees related to non refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company s additional service to modify a previous sale 
therefore  the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes 
refundable tickets expire after one year 
the company records an estimate of breakage revenue for tickets that will expire in twelve months without usage 
these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results 
the company recognizes cargo and other revenue as service is provided 
see separate discussion in frequent flyer accounting  below 
frequent flyer accounting frequent flyer accounting 
the company has a frequent flyer program that is designed to increase customer loyalty 
program participants earn mileage credits miles by flying on united or continental and certain other participating airlines 
program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other non airline partners that participate in the company s loyalty program 
we sell miles to these partners  which include credit card issuers  retail merchants  hotels  car rental companies and our participating airline partners 
miles can be redeemed for free  discounted or upgraded air travel and non travel awards 
the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model 
miles earned in conjunction with flights 
in the case of the sale of air services  the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles 
in accordance with asu  the company determines the estimated selling price of the air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis 
the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis 
the company revised the estimated selling price of miles as a prospective change in estimate  effective january   and it is based on the price we sell miles to star alliance partners in our reciprocal frequent flyer agreements as the best estimate of selling price for these miles 
any changes to the composition of star alliance airline partners may result in the existing estimated selling price of air transportation miles no longer being representative of the best estimate of selling price and could result in a change to the amount and method we use to determine the estimated selling price 
on february   us airways announced an agreement to merge with amr corporation and its intent to exit star alliance as a result of such merger 
we are currently unable to estimate the timing or amount of any changes to estimated selling price as a result of this merger 

table of contents co branded credit card partner mileage sales 
united also has a significant contract to sell frequent flyer miles to its co branded credit card partner  chase 
in june  this contract was modified and the company entered into the co brand agreement with chase 
the company identified five revenue elements in the co brand agreement the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation  use of the united brand and access to frequent flyer member lists  advertising  baggage services  and airport lounge usage together  excluding the air transportation element  the marketing related deliverables 
the fair value of the elements is determined using management s estimated selling price of each element 
the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
accordingly  we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including  but not limited to  discounted cash flows  brand value  volume discounts  published selling prices  number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed 
the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the co brand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered 
the estimated selling price of miles calculated is generally consistent with the methodology as described above in miles earned in conjunction with flights 
united calculates its estimated selling price for miles based on the rate at which we sell miles to our star alliance partners participating in reciprocal frequent flyer programs as the estimated selling price for miles 
management prospectively applied this change in estimate effective january  the financial impact of this change in estimate in was substantially offset by the company s change in estimate of its breakage for a portion of its miles  which were previously not subject to an expiration policy 
ual accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members  which we referred to as breakage  using the redemption method 
ual reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns 
the revised estimates to breakage in increased the estimate of miles in the population that are expected to ultimately expire 
the company s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment 
current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy  or to program rules and program redemption opportunities  may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs 
the company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered 
the other elements are generally recognized as other operating revenue when earned 
the annual impact of adopting asu on operating revenue will decrease over time 
our ability to project the annual decline for each year is significantly impacted by credit card sales volumes  frequent flyer redemption patterns  and other factors 
the following table summarizes information related to ual s and united s frequent flyer deferred revenue liability frequent flyer deferred revenue at december  in millions of miles earned expected to expire or go unredeemed impact of change in outstanding miles or weighted average ticket value on deferred revenue in millions goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually  as of october  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
long lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever an indicator of impairment exists 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of continental s assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger 
all goodwill and other purchase accounting adjustments have been pushed down to continental s financial statements 

table of contents goodwill is measured for impairment by initially comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value  an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded 
the company has one consolidated reporting unit 
in  the company estimated the fair value of the consolidated reporting unit using both an income and a market approach 
the income approach computes fair value by discounting future cash flows of the business and is dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity  passenger yield  traffic  operating costs including fuel prices  appropriate discount rates and other relevant assumptions 
the market approach computes fair value by adding a control premium to the company s market capitalization 
the company s fair value exceeded its carrying value under both approaches  and no goodwill impairment was recorded in the company is also required to assess the goodwill recorded on the separate financial statements of continental for impairment 
the fair value of continental was determined by allocating a percentage of the fair value of the consolidated company as determined and described in the paragraph above 
the percentage of the consolidated fair value allocated to continental was based on a number of measures  including revenue share  available seat mile share  revenue passenger mile share and passenger share 
based on these criteria  this resulted in a fair value allocation of such assets to united and continental of and  respectively 
the fair value of continental exceeded its carrying value  and no goodwill impairment was recorded as of december  the company s indefinite lived intangible assets include certain international route authorities  take off and landing slots at various airports  airline partner alliances and the ual trade name and logo 
the fair values of the assets for purposes of the annual impairment test were determined using the market and income approaches 
the fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market 
we utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport take off and landing slots when sufficient market information was available 
the income approach was primarily used to value the international route authorities  airline partner alliances  the ual trade name and logo  and certain airport take off and landing slots 
the income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset 
projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money 
in most cases  these indefinite lived assets are separately associated with and directly assignable to each separate subsidiary 
any impairment charges resulting from the testing of the fair values of these indefinite lived intangible assets are also assigned to the applicable separate subsidiary 
ual recorded impairment charges for indefinite lived intangible assets of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
during and  continental recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  on certain intangible assets related to european take off and landing slots to reflect the estimated fair value of these assets as part of its annual impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets 
in  ual recorded a million impairment of its brazil routes primarily due to the open skies agreement between the united states and brazil which may result in a decrease in revenue from these routes 
long lived assets 
the net book value of operating property and equipment for ual was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the assets recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections  including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and  when necessary  the recognition of asset impairment charges 
the company records assets acquired  including aircraft  at acquisition cost 
depreciable life is determined through economic analysis  such as reviewing existing fleet plans  obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets 
as aircraft technology has improved  useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be years 
residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in 
table of contents conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets 
residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life 
both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the company s fleet plan and other relevant information 
a one year increase in the average depreciable life of ual s flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately million 
the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
for purposes of this testing  the company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment 
an impairment charge is recognized when the asset s carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value 
the amount of the charge is the difference between the asset s carrying value and fair market value 
defined benefit plan accounting 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees 
the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets 
ual s pension plans under funded status was billion at december   nearly all of which is attributable to continental s plans 
funding requirements for tax qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations 
we estimate that our minimum funding requirements for the continental plans during is approximately million 
the fair value of the plans assets was billion at december   of which billion is attributed to assets of continental s plans 
the following discussion relates only to the continental plans  as the united plans are not material 
when calculating pension expense for  continental assumed that its plans assets would generate a long term rate of return of 
the expected long term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets  which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels 
our projected long term rate of return is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans assets  and is supported by the historical returns on our plans assets 
the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio 
we regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the defined benefit pension plans assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts 
return generating investments include primarily equity securities  fixed income securities and alternative investments eg private equity and hedge funds 
risk mitigating investments include primarily us government and investment grade corporate fixed income securities 
the allocation of assets was as follows at december  percent of total expected long term rate of return equity securities fixed income securities alternatives other pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points from to would increase estimated pension expense by approximately million 

table of contents future pension obligations for the continental plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of at december  ual selected the discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december  that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments 
the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced 
lowering the discount rate by basis points from to would increase the pension liability at december  by approximately million and increase the estimated pension expense by approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  plan provisions  assumed discount rates  pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions 
under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans  those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense  but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees 
all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees 
at december  and  ual had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of million and million  respectively  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
other postretirement benefit plan accounting 
united s postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits  primarily in the us  to retirees and eligible dependents  as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as other benefits 
continental s retiree medical programs permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility 
eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits  which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement 
plan benefits are subject to co payments  deductibles  and other limits as described in the plans 
the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations  or the plan s funded status  in its financial statements 
other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements 
the company has not been required to pre fund its plan obligations  which has resulted in a significant net obligation  as discussed below 
ual s benefit obligation was billion and billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december  and  respectively 
the year over year increase is due to changes in the assumptions used to value the obligation for ual s plan  such as the decrease in the discount rate 
the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions  including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate 
ual determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due 
united s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december  was  as compared to for december  continental s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december  was  as compared to for december  the health care cost trend rate assumed by united and continental for was  as compared to assumed trend rate for of  declining to in a increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase ual s total service and interest cost for the year ended december  by million  whereas  a decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease ual s total service and interest cost for the year ended december  by million  respectively 
a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase ual s postretirement benefit liability by approximately million and increase the estimated benefits expense by approximately million 

table of contents actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions 
under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans  those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense  but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees 
all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees 
at december  and  ual had unrecognized actuarial gains losses for postretirement welfare benefit plans of million and million  respectively  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
income taxes the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those deferred tax assets will become deductible 
the company s management assesses available positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to form a conclusion  management considers positive evidence in the form of reversing temporary differences  projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies  and negative evidence such as recent history of losses 
although the company was no longer in a three year cumulative loss position at the end of  management determined that the loss in  the overall modest level of cumulative pretax income in the three years ended december  of of total revenues in that period and the uncertainty associated with projecting future taxable income supported the conclusion that the valuation allowance was still necessary on net deferred assets 
as a result of the loss sustained in and the need to complete final integration activities that produce synergies and overcome cost increases from new labor agreements  management s position is that sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of the remaining valuation allowance does not exist and has retained a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets 
management will continue to evaluate future financial performance  as well as the impacts of special charges on such performance  to determine whether such performance provides sufficient evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
our net income loss is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on short term investments 
the company s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt

assuming our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments remain at their average levels  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in ual  united and continental interest income of approximately million  million and million  respectively  during 
table of contents commodity price risk aircraft fuel 
the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affects the company s operations  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel  the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements 
the company generally uses financial hedge instruments including fixed price swaps  purchased call options  and commonly used combinations using put and call options including collars sold put option combined with purchased call option and three ways sold put option combined with purchased call option and a higher strike sold call option 
these hedge instruments are generally based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including heating oil  diesel fuel and crude oil 
some financial hedge contracts may result in losses if the underlying commodity prices drop below specified floor prices 
however  the negative impact of these losses may be outweighed by the benefit of lower aircraft fuel cost since the company typically hedges only a portion of its future fuel requirements 
the company does not enter into hedge instruments for trading purposes 
if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into a hedge contract  we may be required to post collateral margin with our hedge counterparties 
the company frequently monitors this margin risk and assesses the potential of posting collateral with each of its counterparties 
at times  when the fair market value of the company s hedge contracts is net positive to the company  it is exposed to the event of non performance by the counterparty to the hedge contract 
the company periodically monitors the credit worthiness of its counterparties and limits its exposure to any single counterparty 
the company may adjust its hedging program based on changes in market conditions 
the following table summarizes information related to the company s cost of fuel and hedging in millions  except percentages ual united continental fuel costs in  fuel cost as a percent of total operating expenses a impact of increase in price per barrel of aircraft fuel on annual fuel expense b fuel hedges asset fair value at december  c impact of a concurrent decrease in forward prices of the underlying commodities on the value of fuel hedges d collateral ual  united and continental would be required to post with fuel hedge counterparties upon a concurrent decrease in forward prices of the underlying commodities of fuel hedges e a includes related taxes and excludes hedging impacts and special charges

table of contents the fuel hedge portfolio is comprised of many individual hedge contracts primarily option contracts on multiple underlying commodities and entered into at various points in time  resulting in a wide range of strike prices with several hedge counterparties

b projections based on estimated consumption of four billion gallons and a price of per gallon  excluding taxes and other delivery costs 
c cash gain loss  including premiums  on existing hedges as of december  includes all hedges whether or not the hedges are designated for hedge accounting 
foreign currency 
the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
some of the company s more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  european euro and japanese yen 
at times  the company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for non risk management purposes 
the result of a uniform percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december  levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pre tax income of approximately million for the year ending december  this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses as of december
