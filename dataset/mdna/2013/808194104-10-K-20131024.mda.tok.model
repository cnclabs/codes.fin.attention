restructuring charges the company s policy is to recognize restructuring costs in accordance with the accounting rules related to exit or disposal activities and compensation and non retirement post employment benefits 
detailed contemporaneous documentation is maintained and updated to ensure that accruals are properly supported 
if management determines that there is a change in estimate  the accruals are adjusted to reflect this change 

table of contents purchase accounting and goodwill business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires the company to record assets and liabilities of the business acquired at their estimated fair market values as of the acquisition date 
any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the company uses valuation specialists to perform appraisals and assist in the determination of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these valuations require management to make estimates and assumptions 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of june in september  the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting guidance on the annual testing of goodwill for impairment 
the new accounting guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
based on a qualitative assessment  if the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not lower than its carrying amount  the entity must then test goodwill for impairment from a quantitative perspective 
if the qualitative assessment indicates the fair value of a reporting is higher than its carrying value  no further testing is required 
the company early adopted the new accounting standard in conjunction with its june  annual goodwill impairment test 
management uses judgment to determine whether to use a qualitative analysis or a quantitative fair value measurement that combines the income and market valuation techniques for each of the company s reporting units that carry goodwill 
if circumstances change during interim periods between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value  the company would test goodwill for impairment 
factors which would necessitate an interim goodwill impairment assessment include a sustained decline in the company stock price  prolonged negative industry or economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
as previously discussed  effective september   the masterbatch product family was split into two separate product families  custom performance colors and masterbatch solutions 
consequently  the related goodwill was allocated to the custom performance colors and masterbatch solutions reporting units in emea and the americas based on the relative fair value of these reporting units 
additional goodwill was recorded in fiscal as a result of the ecm plastics  inc acquisition and allocated to reporting units based on relative fair value 
as of june   the annual goodwill impairment test date for fiscal  goodwill exists in four of the company reporting units in emea masterbatch solutions  specialty powders  custom performance colors and distribution services and four reporting units in the americas masterbatch solutions  custom performance colors  engineered plastics and specialty powders 
annual goodwill impairment test management used the quantitative fair value measurement for its annual goodwill impairment test as of june  for each of the reporting units identified above 
specifically  the testing of goodwill for impairment was determined using a two step process 
both the first step of determining the fair value of a reporting unit and the second step of determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets are judgmental in nature and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the fair values of all these reporting units were established using a combination of the income and market approaches 
these valuation methodologies use estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  the determination of appropriate market comparables  projected future cash flows including timing and profitability  discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  and projected future economic and market conditions 
based on this quantitative analysis  management concluded that as of june   the emea masterbatch solutions and distribution services reporting units and the americas masterbatch solutions  engineered plastics and custom performance colors reporting units had fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying values 
management also concluded  based on the quantitative fair value measurements performed  that as of june   the fair values of the americas and emea specialty powders and emea custom performance colors reporting units exceeded their carrying values by  and  respectively 
as of august   the company americas specialty powders reporting unit had goodwill of million while goodwill in the emea specialty powders and custom performance colors reporting units was million and million  respectively 
the goodwill associated with these reporting units is primarily the result of the acquisitions made within the last three years 
generally  goodwill recorded in business combinations is more susceptible to risk of impairment soon after the acquisition primarily because the business combination is recorded at fair value based on operating plans and economic conditions present at the time of the acquisition 
if operating results or economic conditions deteriorate soon after an acquisition  it could result in the impairment of the acquired goodwill 
a change in macroeconomic conditions in the 
table of contents americas and emea regions  as well as future changes in the judgments  assumptions and estimates that were used in the company goodwill impairment testing for these three reporting units  including the discount rate and future cash flow projections  could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value 
see note of the consolidated financial statements within this form k for further discussion on goodwill 
long lived assets long lived assets  except goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows estimated by the company to be generated by such asset groups 
fair value is the basis for the measurement of any asset write downs that are recorded 
adjustments to the estimated remaining useful lives may result in accelerated depreciation  which is included in cost of sales 
income taxes the company s provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of judgment by management 
this provision is impacted by the income and tax rates of the countries where the company operates 
a change in the geographical source of the company s income can have a significant effect on the tax rate 
no taxes are provided on earnings which are permanently reinvested 
various taxing authorities periodically audit the company s tax returns 
these audits may include questions regarding the company s tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with these various tax filing positions  the company records tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions where the likelihood of sustaining the position is not more likely than not based on its technical merits 
a significant period of time may elapse before a particular matter  for which the company has recorded a tax liability  is audited and fully resolved 
the establishment of the company s tax liabilities relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with its various filing positions 
although management believes those estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results could differ  resulting in gains or losses that may be material to the company s consolidated statements of operations 
to the extent that the company prevails in matters for which tax liabilities have been recorded  or are required to pay amounts in excess of these tax liabilities  the company s effective tax rate in any given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate in the financial statement period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement could be recognized as a reduction in the company s effective tax rate in the financial statement period of resolution 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
evidence  such as the results of operations for the current and preceding years  is given more weight than projections of future income  which is inherently uncertain 
the company s losses in the us in recent periods provide sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in the us the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets in the us until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of such assets 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company has several postretirement benefit plans worldwide 
these plans consist primarily of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
these benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business that represents obligations that will be ultimately settled far into the future 
pension and postretirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate period of employment based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by the company 
for financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make many assumptions in order to value the plans liabilities on a projected and accumulated basis  as well as to determine the annual expense for the plans 
the assumptions chosen take into account historical experience  the current economic environment and management s best judgment regarding future experience 
assumptions include the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on assets  future salary increases  health care escalation rates  cost of living increases  turnover  retirement ages and mortality 
while management believes the company s assumptions are appropriate  significant 
table of contents differences in the company s actual experience or significant changes in the company s assumptions  including the discount rate used and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  may materially affect the company s pension and postretirement obligations and future expenses 
accounting guidance requires the full unfunded liability to be recognized on the consolidated balance sheet 
the cumulative difference between actual experience and assumed experience is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for most of the plans  these gains or losses are recognized in expense over the average future service period of employees to the extent that they exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other postretirement benefits and assets 
the effects of any plan changes are also included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and then recognized in expense over the average future service period of the affected plan 
the company consults with various actuaries at least annually when reviewing and selecting the discount rates to be used 
the discount rates used by the company are based on yields of various corporate and governmental bond indices with actual maturity dates that approximate the estimated benefit payment streams of the related pension plans 
the discount rates are also reviewed in comparison with current benchmark indices  economic market conditions and the movement in the benchmark yield since the previous fiscal year 
the liability weighted average discount rate for the defined benefit pension plans is for fiscal  compared with in fiscal for the other postretirement benefit plan  the rate is for fiscal and for fiscal this rate represents the interest rates generally available in the united states  which is the company s only country with other postretirement benefit liabilities 
another assumption that affects the company s pension expense is the expected long term rate of return on assets 
some of the company s plans are funded 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on assets assumption is for fiscal in consultation with its actuaries  the company estimates its pension expense will decrease by million in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily as a result of an increase in the weighted average discount rate assumption 
the company s principal objective is to ensure that sufficient funds are available to provide benefits as and when required under the terms of the plans 
the company utilizes investments that provide benefits and maximizes the long term investment performance of the plans without taking on undue risk while complying with various legal funding requirements 
the company  through its investment advisors  has developed detailed asset and liability models to aid in implementing optimal asset allocation strategies 
equity securities are invested in equity indexed funds  which minimizes concentration risk while offering market returns 
the debt securities are invested in a long term bond indexed fund which provides a stable low risk return 
the fixed insurance contracts allow the company to closely match a portion of the liability to the expected payout of benefit with little risk 
the company  in consultation with its actuaries  analyzes current market trends  the current plan performance and expected market performance of both the equity and bond markets to arrive at the expected return on each asset category over the long term 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on assets for the company s pension plans and other postretirement plans as of august  change in assumption impact on fiscal benefits expense impact on august  projected benefit obligation for pension plans impact on august  projected benefit obligation for postretirement plans in thousands basis point decrease in discount rate basis point increase in discount rate basis point decrease in expected long term rate of return on assets basis point increase in expected long term rate of return on assets stock based compensation the company grants certain types of equity awards as part of its long term incentive compensation strategy 
all such awards are expensed based on the fair value of the respective award 
fair value for awards that involve service or performance conditions for vesting is determined based on the market price on the grant date  while fair value for awards which include market conditions for vesting requires the use of a valuation model 
the concept of modeling is used with such awards because observable market prices for these types of awards are not available 
the modeling technique that is generally considered to most appropriately value this type of award is the monte carlo valuation model 

table of contents the monte carlo valuation model requires assumptions based on management s judgment regarding  among others  the volatility of the company s stock  the correlation rate of the company s stock price compared to peer companies and the expected rate of interest 
the company uses historical data to determine the assumptions to be used in the monte carlo valuation model and has no reason to believe that future data is likely to materially differ from historical data 
however  changes in the assumptions to reflect future stock price volatility  future correlation experience and future interest rates may result in a material change to the fair value of such awards 
while management believes the company s assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in the company s actual experience or significant changes in the company s assumptions  including the volatility of the company s stock  the correlation rate and the interest rate  may materially affect the company s future stock based compensation expense 
the awards with a market condition granted prior to fiscal are accounted for as equity awards given that recipients receive shares of stock upon vesting  and expense for these awards is recognized over the service period regardless of whether the market condition is achieved and the awards ultimately vest 
awards with a market condition granted in fiscal provide recipients an option to receive cash or shares of common stock upon vesting 
consequently  such awards are accounted for as liability awards and the company remeasures these awards at fair value on a quarterly basis over the service period
