item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand our company 
the md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
this overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of the md a  as well as a few suggestions for reading these pages 
the md a includes the following sections business overview a brief description of fiscal year results of operations an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the two years presented in our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows  sources and uses of cash  and contractual obligations and a discussion of factors affecting our future cash flow 
critical accounting policies a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates 
our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed in this section  are summarized in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
business overview sales were slightly lower and our business was less profitable for fiscal than in fiscal this continued a trend of lower operating income  net income and cash flow from fiscal to fiscal there are a number of factors that contributed to this trend  most notably a operational issues such as competition and our response to competitive factors  as well as b less controllable factors such as adverse weather conditions and environmental and political issues 
the decrease in sales was largely due to a decrease in coffee sales for the period  without offsetting sales in other product categories  partly due to continuing weather issues in our core market areas 
competition in past years  we have discussed the effect of competition on our water sales and water cooler rentals  including pressure from large competitors  both distribution and retail  as well as the movement by consumers to water filtration units 
more recently  we have experienced competition for coffee sales from a number of non traditional competitors 
in particular  single serve coffee and coffee machines have become significant products for office products companies  and have become available in an increasing number of retail and online outlets 
operational initiatives in the face of competition  companies that do not cut prices face significant loss in volume of sales  but cutting prices adversely affects margins and operating income 
in the current market environment  we have had to cut our prices to preserve our volume 
in response to the competitive pressures noted above  we have  as previously disclosed  an opportunity to leverage our distribution network by selling other products  notably office products under the crystal rock officetm brand 
our expansion strategy has also involved refocusing on sales and marketing with a view to enhancing the value of our distribution system and customer relationship 
in furtherance of this strategy  beginning in we have increased operating expenses primarily in two areas  the first by hiring additional sales personnel  and the second by building a new information technology it infrastructure system  the cost of which has been part of sg a expense 
the it infrastructure build up is intended both to modernize our existing it systems in all facets of our business and to develop a first class web based system for consumers to order our products 
the execution of our strategy has been somewhat more lengthy than anticipated 
in  we began to distribute products under the crystal rock officetm brand and commenced a hiring effort to increase our sales force substantially 
we believed that we would be able to finish this process in and obtain the full benefit of it in  but the hiring and training of sales staff has gone slower than anticipated 
we now estimate that the benefit of a larger  well trained sales staff may not be fully realized until or however  for a larger sales force to increase revenue  we will have to continue to be committed to offering quality products and customer service 
similarly  the development of our enhanced it infrastructure system has been more costly and difficult than we expected 
we have been working to build an enhanced system for customer relationship management crm using the well known platform salesforce 
com  a platform we originally intended to use for all of our crm needs  including sales  our route system  and customer service 
as originally devised  our strategy would have involved replacing our existing route system software with this platform  but difficulties encountered in making the different software systems compatible have pushed this plan back and resulted in operating inefficiencies over the past two years 
this in turn has negatively impacted our earnings during these periods 
we are currently assessing the issues involved in this installation and are executing a plan to have the system operational in we are also not satisfied with the status of our crystal rock officetm brand website for online ordering of office products  and believe that a website as robust and effective as we would like may not be fully developed until we are working to control our expenses by scaling back our implementation of salesforce 
com and deferring some of our it investment until revenues stabilize and increase 
while we are optimistic about the effect of these revisions to our strategy  there is no assurance that we can manage these changes in an optimal way so as to increase revenues and net income  and improve our cash flow 
we expect to be a challenging year  but believe that our approach  which is to defer some change until we have consolidated the changes we have made so far  is our best path to success as we pursue the opportunity to become a larger company with a more diverse product offering 
other factors while changing weather is a constant in our market area  we experienced extreme weather events in and that affected sales in those years and beyond 
in late august  tropical storm irene caused considerable  widespread damage in parts of our market area 
flooding and resulting road damage reduced our ability to service customers in vermont and northern new york 
in addition  our costs increased to access our springs and ship products 
the impact of tropical storm irene was felt into the first quarter of subsequently  parts of connecticut and massachusetts experienced a major snowstorm in late october  shutting off power and reducing access in some parts of those states for more than a week  with resulting service interruptions and operating cost increases in those areas 
the major portion of the financial effect from this early snowstorm was felt in the first quarter of more recently  in late october  hurricane sandy caused significant destruction in the coastal connecticut  new york city  and northern new jersey portions of our market area 
again  our customer service was interrupted  and we incurred extra costs 
hurricane sandy affected our business in the last few days of fiscal and into the first quarter of fiscal the effects of extreme weather like these storms is difficult to quantify because of other variables  but in general these disruptions were temporary and without permanent effects on our business 
in terms of local politics  environmental groups have argued that the use of plastic as a bottled water container is wasteful and deleterious  and in a handful of municipalities have banned government purchases 
these factors generally affect single serve water containers more than water sales in and gallon containers  but they do influence our marketplace 
for our fiscal year ended october   we determined our goodwill was impaired a non cash charge in the amount of  which materially reduced our income from operations and net income to losses 
at october   the valuation by which we measure goodwill impairment was significantly affected by our lower earnings trend 
impairment of goodwill does not affect the company s liquidity or indicate its profitability prospects in the future 
nevertheless  it was a substantial component of our loss from operations of  and net loss of  but for the impairment of goodwill  those line items would have shown income  not losses 
as of october   we continued to have adequate cash on hand and borrowing capacity while reducing debt 
as discussed above  in and  we used a significant amount of cash to fund an upgrade of our it infrastructure to facilitate an expansion of our product offerings and run our business more efficiently 
subsequent to fiscal year we used a significant amount of cash for discretionary subordinated debt reduction 
the market area in which we operate has an uncertain economic environment 
while we have created opportunities that we expect will result in increased sales  we anticipate cost pressures related to commodities affecting our business  most notably fuel and coffee  as we continue to build our brands 
results of operations fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  sales sales for fiscal year were  compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
sales attributable to acquisitions in fiscal year were  the comparative breakdown of sales is as follows product line in s in s difference in s diff 
water coffee refreshment equipment rental other total water water sales volume increased as a result of an increase in bottles sold 
however  that was offset by a decrease in price 
the increase in volume was primarily due to more bottles being sold to outside distributors 
weather continues to have a negative impact on distribution as tropical storm irene and hurricane sandy interrupted service in the first and fourth quarters of  respectively 
acquisitions had no significant impact in the change of water sales in fiscal year compared to coffee there was a decrease in sales of single serve coffee  to  from  despite an increase of in our cool beans pod sales 
cool beans made up of the category in there was also a decrease in sales of our traditional coffee products for office and food service brewers 
in general  coffee sales declined as a result of strong competition in the marketplace  as well as a changing distribution landscape 
acquisitions did not materially affect this category in compared to refreshment a decrease in soft drink and vending sales more than offset increased sales of coffee refreshment products as well as cups 
equipment rental the decrease in equipment rental revenue in fiscal year compared to the prior year was a result of a decrease in average units in the field while average rental price remained essentially the same 
the decrease in placements was due to lower market demand primarily earlier in the year 
acquisitions had no impact in the change of rental revenue in fiscal year compared to other the increase is attributable to sales of office products which increased and stamp sales which increased 
fees that are charged to offset energy costs for delivery and freight  raw materials  and bottling operations decreased based on the market price of diesel fuel 
gross profit cost of goods sold gross profit decreased  or  in fiscal year compared to  to  from  gross profit as a percentage of sales was for both years 
the decrease in gross profit margin was attributable to lower sales  particularly for coffee and rental  and changes in product sales mix  most notably toward higher office products sales  which yield a lower margin 
in addition  gross profit in fiscal year was negatively impacted by a decrease in fuel adjustment charges that are charged to offset energy costs for delivery and freight  raw materials  and bottling operations 
cost of goods sold includes all costs to bottle water  costs of purchasing and receiving products for resale including freight  as well as costs associated with product quality  warehousing and handling costs  internal transfers  and the repair and service of rental equipment  but does not include the costs of distributing our product to our customers 
we include distribution costs in selling  general  and administrative expense  and the amount is reported below 
other companies may include distribution costs in their cost of goods sold  in which case  on a comparative basis  such other companies may have a lower gross margin as a result 
income loss from operations operating expenses the loss from operations was  in compared to income from operations of  in  a decrease of  the most significant component of this decrease was goodwill impairment of  in there was no such impairment in total operating expenses increased to  for the year  from  the prior year  an increase of  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  in fiscal year and  in  an increase of  or 
of total sg a expenses route sales costs increased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  primarily related to higher labor  fuel  and vehicle costs 
included as a component of route sales costs are total direct distribution related costs which increased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  primarily as a result of higher labor  fuel  and vehicle costs  selling costs increased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year as a result of higher labor costs associated with hiring and training a larger sales staff  administrative costs increased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year  in part as a result of higher costs to enhance our it infrastructure 
those costs were  in  compared to  in  and more than offset a lower provision for bad debts as well as lower consulting and legal fees 
advertising expenses decreased to  in fiscal year from  in  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in advertising costs is primarily related to a decrease in agency costs and internet and yellow pages advertising 
amortization decreased  or  to  in fiscal year from  in amortization is attributable to intangible assets that were acquired as part of acquisitions in recent years 
there was a gain from the sale of miscellaneous assets in fiscal year of  compared to a loss on the sale of assets of  in fiscal year these were sales of miscellaneous assets no longer used in the course of business 
in fiscal year  we incurred an impairment loss of  the impairment loss was a non cash charge and was a result of the assessment of our goodwill as of october  goodwill had been recorded for acquisitions from through we conducted an assessment of goodwill as of october  and the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill is a two step process 
in step one  the fair value of the company is determined  using a weighted average of three different approaches quoted stock price a market approach  value comparisons to publicly traded companies see note believed to have comparable reporting units a market approach  and discounted net cash flow an income approach 
these approaches provide a reasonable estimation of the value of the company and take into consideration the company s thinly traded stock and concentrated holdings  market comparable valuations  and expected results of operations 
we used the following percentages for the weighted average of the three different approaches in both fiscal year and these were the companies used in the year marked company name exchange symbol coca cola bottling co  consolidated nyse coke x x farmer bros 
co 
nasdaq farm x x green mountain coffee roasters  inc nasdaq gmcr x x a monster beverage corp 
nasdaq hans x x coca cola enterprises  inc nyse mnst x x national beverage corp 
nasdaq fizz x x cott corporation toronto bcb x x coffee holding co  inc nasdaq jva x x dr 
pepper snapple group  inc nyse dps x x leading brands  inc nasdaq lbix x x primo water corporation nasdaq prmw x x a hansen natural corp 
changed its name to monster beverage corp 
on january  quoted stock price value comparisons to publicly traded companies discounted net cash flow the resulting estimated fair value is then compared to the company s equity value 
our step one assessment as of october  indicated that goodwill on our books may be impaired when we determined the company s fair value was less than the company s equity as of the valuation date 
the assessment as of october  concluded that the company s fair value exceeded the company s equity  and therefore goodwill was not impaired as of the valuation date 
when an impairment was indicated as of october   we used step two to determine the amount of the impairment 
in that process we allocated the estimated fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the company including unrecognized intangible assets as if the company had been acquired in a business combination using the estimated fair value as the price paid 
we then recognized impairment in the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of goodwill as determined in the allocation 
in establishing fair market valuations in both step one and step two of the goodwill impairment testing process  the company assumed a nontaxable hypothetical transaction considering the feasibility of an acquisition structure and whether the assumed structure would result in the highest and best use and would provide maximum value to the seller  including consideration of related tax implications 
impairment was primarily the result of a decline in estimate fair value resulting from the income approach which relies on a discounted cash flow analysis of the company s projected cash flows as well as an analysis of comparable guideline companies 
these valuations are reflective of the competitive business environment that the company operates in 
in addition  as mentioned above  the company has undertaken operating initiatives to increase its competitive advantage over the long term 
these initiatives have increased operating expenses prior to generating anticipated sales which negatively impacted cash flow in the early years of the analysis 
other income and expense  income taxes  and loss income before income taxes interest expense was  for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year  a decrease of  the decrease is primarily attributable to lower outstanding debt 
the loss before income taxes in fiscal year was  compared to income before income taxes of  in fiscal year  a decrease of  aside from the impairment charge  operating results declined from to as result of lower sales and gross profit and higher operating costs 
the tax benefit for fiscal year was  compared to tax expense of  for fiscal year and resulted in an effective tax rate of in and in the tax benefit in is a result of the write off of goodwill that resulted in the reversal of a deferred tax liability 
the lower effective tax rate in is attributable to the exclusion of a portion of the impairment loss related to nondeductible goodwill from the determination of income taxes 
net of the impairment charge  there was an increase in the effective tax rate from to primarily as a result of a settlement of a state tax issue that was favorable to the company in that did not recur in our total effective tax rate is a combination of federal and state rates for the states in which we operate 
net loss income the net loss in fiscal year was  compared to net income of  in  a decrease of  as noted above  the most significant component of the net loss in was goodwill impairment of  aside from the impairment charge  earnings were lower as a result of lower sales and gross profit and higher operating costs 
the net loss and income in the respective years was completely attributable to continuing operations 
based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding of  basic and diluted  loss per share in fiscal year was 
per share 
this was a decrease of 
per share from fiscal year  when the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding was  basic and diluted and we had net income of 
per share 
the fair value of our interest rate hedge swap agreements increased favorably  during fiscal year compared to a favorable increase of  in this resulted in unrealized gains of  and  net of reclassification adjustments and taxes  respectively  for the fiscal years ended october  and the increase during the year has been recognized as an adjustment to net loss income to arrive at comprehensive income as defined by the applicable accounting standards 
liquidity and capital resources as of october   we had working capital of  compared to  as of october   a decrease of  the decrease in working capital was attributable to a decrease in net cash provided by operations as well as an expected discretionary payment of  of subordinated debt classified as a current liability as of october  net cash provided by operating activities was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  the decrease reflects lower net income in we use cash provided by operations to repay debt and fund capital expenditures 
in fiscal year  we used  for repayment of debt 
this was  more than we paid in because of a  one time repayment of senior debt in february in we had  of debt repayment related to acquisitions which did not reoccur in we used  more for capital expenditures in than in the increase was primarily due to upgrading cooler and brewer inventory 
in addition  there was  more capital expenditures on computer system upgrades in and  in operating expenses to fund our continuing it infrastructure upgrades 
we used  of cash to complete acquisitions in compared to  in the prior year 
our credit agreement with bank of america has a total loan capacity of  and obligates the company to a  term note and access to a  revolving line of credit 
the revolving line of credit can be used for the purchase of fixed assets  to fund acquisitions  to collateralize letters of credit  and for operating capital and matures in april since sufficient cash was generated from operations  we have not borrowed from the facility in the past two years  so there was no balance on the line of credit as of october  except for a collateralized a letter of credit in the amount of  consequently  as of october   there was  available to borrow from the revolving line of credit 
there was  outstanding on the term note as of october  the agreement amortizes the term debt over a five year period with equal monthly installments of  commencing may   and a final payment of  due at the end of five years 
also under the agreement  the company is obligated to calculate consolidated excess cash flow based on its financial results for each fiscal year to determine if additional principal is due on the term note 
based on the results of the calculation for fiscal year  in accordance with the agreement a  principal payment for the term loan was made on february  in december  the bank waived the consolidated excess cash flow requirement for fiscal year the company is subject to various restrictive covenants under the agreement  and is prohibited from entering into other debt agreements without the bank s consent 
the covenants include senior debt service coverage as defined of greater than to  total debt service coverage as defined of greater than to  and senior debt to ebitda as defined of less than to as of october   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of our credit facility 
the agreement prohibits us from paying dividends without prior consent of the lender 
in  the agreement was amended to change the definition of consolidated adjusted operating cash flow to add  to the calculation of cash flow for the reference periods under the agreement that end april   july  and october  this revision is intended to reflect the expenditures for upgrades to the company s it infrastructure  which are expected to provide a long term benefit but do not qualify as capital expenditures under the agreement 
under the agreement  interest is paid at a rate of one month libor plus a margin based on the achievement of a specified leverage ratio 
as of october  the margin was for the term note and for the revolving line of credit 
the company is required to fix the interest rate on at least of the outstanding balance of the term note and accomplishes this by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
as of october   the company had  of the term debt subject to variable interest rates 
the one month libor was 
resulting in total variable interest rates of and  for the term note and the revolving line of credit as of october  in addition to the senior debt  as of october   the company had subordinated debt owed to henry  peter and jack baker  all of whom are directors and significant shareholders  in the aggregate principal amount of  that is due october  subsequent to the fiscal year end in december  with consent of bank of america and the subordinated debt holders  we used  of cash to repay subordinated debt  reducing the balance outstanding to  as of october   we had three interest rate swap agreements with bank of america in effect 
the intent of one swap  entered into on april   is to fix the interest rate on at least of the outstanding balance on the term loan as required by the credit facility 
the swap fixes the interest rate for the swapped amount at plus the applicable margin  
an additional swap entered into on the same date offsets the swap that fixed the interest on a portion of the term loan and became ineffective when we entered into the agreement 
in addition to our senior and subordinated debt commitments  we have significant future cash commitments  primarily in the form of operating leases that are not reported on the balance sheet 
these operating leases are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the following table sets forth our contractual commitments as of october  payment due by period contractual obligations total after debt interest on debt operating leases licensing fees total interest based on of outstanding senior debt at the hedged interest rate discussed above  of outstanding senior debt at a variable rate of and subordinated debt at a rate of 
the amount does not include the  discretionary payment made in december customer deposits have been excluded from the table 
deposit balances vary from period to period with water sales but future increases and decreases in the balances are not accurately predictable 
deposits are excluded because  net of periodic additions and reductions  it is probable that a customer deposit balance will always be outstanding as long as the business operates 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we have no other material contractual obligations or commitments 
factors affecting future cash flow generating cash from operating activities and access to credit is integral to the success of our business 
we continue to generate cash from operating activities to service scheduled debt repayment and fund capital expenditures 
in addition  we have capacity to borrow from our acquisition line of credit for capital expenditures and acquisitions 
we also lease a significant amount of our vehicles and all of our buildings 
adverse economic conditions in recent years have negatively impacted many businesses financial performance and restricted credit availability 
in addition  we do not think that the economy in our region has fully recovered from the recession that started in the competitive landscape created by the economic environment has eroded our margin over that time 
as mentioned above  we have used cash to build an information technology infrastructure to facilitate the expansion of our product offerings and run our business more efficiently and increased and trained our sales staff to gain an immediate competitive edge and prosper when the economy in our region improves 
however  no assurance can be given that the future economic environment will not adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations or that we will have adequate access to credit 
factors affecting quarterly performance our business and financial trends vary from quarter to quarter based on  but not limited to  seasonal demands for our products  climate  and economic and geographic trends 
consequently  results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative  through extrapolation  or otherwise  of results for a longer period 
in the past year we have experienced weather related events that have influenced quarterly performance 
although weather is always variable  we feel this year s extremes  and their far reaching effects  are an aberration in the region 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of the statements in accordance with these principles requires that we make estimates  using available data and our judgment for such things as valuing assets  accruing liabilities  and estimating expenses 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts we routinely review our accounts receivable  by customer account aging  to determine if the amounts due are collectible based on information we receive from the customer  past history  and economic conditions 
in doing so  we adjust our allowance accordingly to reflect the cumulative amount that we feel is uncollectible 
this estimate may vary from the proceeds that we actually collect 
if the estimate is too low  we may incur higher bad debt expenses in the future resulting in lower net income 
if the estimate is too high  we may experience lower bad debt expense in the future resulting in higher net income 
fixed assets depreciation we maintain buildings  machinery and equipment  and furniture and fixtures to operate our business 
we estimate the life of individual assets to allocate the cost over the expected life 
the basis for such estimates is use  technology  required maintenance  and obsolescence 
we periodically review these estimates and adjust them if necessary 
nonetheless  if we overestimate the life of an asset or assets  at a point in the future  we would have to incur higher depreciation costs and consequently  lower net income 
if we underestimate the life of an asset or assets  we would absorb too much depreciation in the early years resulting in higher net income in the later years when the asset is still in service 
goodwill intangible asset impairment we have acquired a significant number of companies 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired has been recorded as goodwill 
if goodwill is not impaired  it would remain as an asset on our balance sheet at the value assigned in the acquisitions 
if it is impaired  we would be required to write down the asset to an amount that accurately reflects its estimated implied value 
we completed a valuation of the company performed as of october  and as of october  we determined that goodwill was impaired and as of october  goodwill was not impaired 
the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill is a two step process 
in step one  the fair value of the company is determined  using a weighted average of three different approaches quoted stock price a market approach  value comparisons to publicly traded companies believed to have comparable reporting units a market approach  and discounted net cash flow an income approach 
this approach provides a reasonable estimation of the value of the company and takes into consideration the company s thinly traded stock and concentrated holdings  market comparable valuations  and expected results of operations 
the resulting estimated fair value is then compared to its equity value 
on october  the step one assessment yielded the following fair value determined controlling minority interest value value a weighting contribution quoted stock price guideline companies discounted net cash flow concluded fair value a reflects application of the following control premiums for the quoted stock price approach  for guideline approach  and zero for the discounted net cash flow dcf approach 
guideline and dcf approaches also reflect addition of cash balance 
the concluded fair value was less than the company s equity value as of october  by 
if the equity value exceeds the fair value in step one then step two estimates the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities including unrecognized intangible assets 
this value is then allocated among the assets and liabilities as if they had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value was the price paid 
we relied  in part  on certain assumptions in making the valuation conclusion 
if some or all of these assumptions change in the future  there may be a material impact on the valuation of the company  which may result in an additional impairment of goodwill 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the following we made certain assumptions in the calculation of discount rates  risk premiums  and capital structure weightings 
however  changes in capital markets may significantly change these assumptions in the future 
we used our knowledge of the business  industry and economy to assemble financial projections including our plans to expand our product offerings 
unforeseen events that dramatically change such influential factors as the economy  environment  and weather may positively or negatively affect the accuracy of these projections 
calculation of a control premium is a significant component in the assessment of goodwill 
this is a common valuation technique that relies on assumptions based on equity markets  credit markets and the merger and acquisition environment and the availability of buyers 
in step two  we then allocated the estimated fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the company including unrecognized intangible assets as if the company had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value was the price paid 
the amount of impairment recognized was the difference the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied value of goodwill as determined in this allocation 
in addition to the assumptions we made in the valuation process during step one  we used important resources and made assumptions in step two in order to allocate fair value 
these include but are not limited to we relied on our experience in the industry and knowledge of the business to assign value to tangible and intangible assets such as customer relationships  workforce  contracts leases  royalties and fixed assets 
our ability to interpret data from other companies and valuations as well as publicly available economic reports 
consideration and use of several commonly used valuation models such as cost  market and income approaches as well as discounted cash flow analysis  relief from royalty  excess earnings method  and avoided loss of income method and weighted average models weighted average cost of capital and weighted average return on assets to obtain and verify valuations and allocate them accordingly 
in establishing fair market valuations in both step one and step two of the goodwill impairment testing process  the company assumed a nontaxable hypothetical transaction considering the feasibility of an acquisition structure and whether the assumed structure would result in the highest and best use and would provide maximum value to the seller  including consideration of related tax implications 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their corresponding tax basis 
the valuation of these deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on estimates that are dependent on rate and time assumptions 
if these estimates do not prove to be correct in the future  we may have over or understated income tax expense and  as a result  earnings 
financial accounting standards board fasb guidance clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company s financial statements 
the guidance prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we lease various facilities and equipment under cancelable and non cancelable short and long term operating leases  which are described in item of this annual report on form k
