this discussion and analysis contains statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or our future financial performance 
as a result of many factors  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  levels of activity  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
overview we are a development stage company formed to commercialize flexible pv modules using our proprietary technology 
for the year ended december   we generated million of revenue 
our revenue from product sales was million and revenue from government research and development contracts was million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
currently  we are producing consumer oriented products focusing on charging devices powered by or enhanced by our solar modules 
products in these markets are priced based on the overall product value proposition as compared with directly competitive products or substitute products rather than on a cost per watt basis  typically used in commodity solar markets 
we continue to develop new consumer products and we have adjusted our utilization of our equipment to meet our near term forecast sales in we accelerated our transition to a business model focusing on developing pv integrated consumer electronics 
in june we launched our new line of consumer products under the enerplex brand  and introduced our first product  the surfr  a solar assisted case and charger for the apple iphone s smart phone featuring our ultra light cigs thin film technology 
the charger incorporates our ultra light and thin pv module into a sleek  protective iphone s case  along with a thin battery 

table of contents the charger adds minimal weight and size to an iphone smart phone  yet provides supplemental charging when needed 
in august we announced the launch of the second version of surfr  a solar assisted charger for the samsung galaxy s iii  which provides additional battery life 
in december  we launched the enerplex kickr and enerplex jumpr product series 
the enerplex kickr iv is an extremely portable  compact and durable solar charging device  approximately seven inches by seven inches when folded  and weighing only grams  or less than half a pound 
the kickr iv provides watt regulated power that can help charge phones  tablets  digital cameras  and other devices 
the kickr iv is ideal for outdoor activities such as camping  hiking and mountain climbing and daily city use 
complementing the kickr iv is the jumpr and the jumpr  rechargeable  portable battery packs providing from three to five complete charge cycles for a smart phone 
currently  we are working to develop the iphone version of the surfr solar assisted charger 
our consumer products are available to customers through third party distributors and retailers and through our website at www 
enerplex 
biz  our retail website 
in  we plan to continue our expansion of distribution channels in the us and worldwide 
we continue to design and manufacture pv integrated consumer electronics as well as portable power applications for commercial and military users 
due to the high durability of the monolithic integration employed by our technology  the capability to customize modules into different form factors and the industry leading light weight and flexibility provided by our modules  we feel that the potential applications for our products are numerous 
significant trends  uncertainties and challenges we believe that the significant trends  uncertainties and challenges that directly or indirectly affect our financial performance and results of operations include our ability to generate customer acceptance of and demand for our products  successful ramping up of commercial production on the equipment installed  our products are successfully and timely certified for use in our target markets  successful operating of production tools to achieve the efficiencies  throughput and yield necessary to reach our cost targets  the products we design are saleable at a price sufficient to generate profits  our strategic alliance with tfg radiant results in the design  manufacture and sale of sufficient products to achieve profitability  our ability to raise sufficient capital to enable us to reach a level of sales sufficient to achieve profitability on terms favorable to us  effective management of the planned ramp up of our operations  our ability to successfully develop and maintain strategic relationships with key partners  including oems  system integrators and distributors  who deal directly with end users in our target markets  our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market or capital market  our ability to achieve projected operational performance and cost metrics  our ability to enter into commercially viable licensing  joint venture  or other commercial arrangements  and availability of raw materials 
basis of presentation our activities to date have consisted substantially of raising capital  research and development  and establishment of our production operation 
revenues to date have been generated primarily from our governmental research and development contracts and have not been significant 
our planned principal operations to commercialize flexible pv modules and pv integrated electronics have commenced  but have generated limited revenue to date 
accordingly  we are considered to be in the development stage and we have provided additional disclosure of inception to date activity in our statements of operations and comprehensive income loss  statements of stockholders equity and statements of cash flows 
significant accounting policies 
table of contents related party transactions we are party to several operating agreements  including a joint development agreement  a supply agreement  a contract manufacturing agreement  and a services agreement with tfg radiant  which is also our largest shareholder 
accounting for transactions under these agreements is consistent with those defined in our significant accounting policies 
additional disclosure of related party transactions is included in our financial statements and footnotes 
revenue recognition product revenue product revenue is generated from commercial sales of flexible pv modules and pv integrated consumer electronics 
products are sold through our own website and through the use of online retailers and distributors 
revenue is recognized as modules are delivered and title has transferred to the customer 
estimated costs of returns and allowances and discounts are accrued as a reduction to sales when revenue is recognized 
we are in the development stage and we generated product revenues of  for the year ended december  government contracts revenue revenue from governmental research and development contracts is generated under terms that are cost plus fee or firm fixed price 
revenue from cost plus fee contracts is recognized as costs are incurred on the basis of direct costs plus allowable indirect costs and an allocable portion of the fixed fee 
revenue from firm fixed price contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting  with costs and estimated profits included in contract revenue as work is performed 
if actual and estimated costs to complete a contract indicate a loss  provision is made currently for the loss anticipated on the contract 
inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the weighted average method 
as a development stage entity with limited production  inventory values do not include labor and overhead allocations which would be typical in higher volume production environments  however  such differences are not significant 
inventory balances are frequently evaluated to ensure that they do not exceed net realizable value 
the computation for net realizable value takes into account many factors  including expected demand  product lifecycle and development plans  module efficiency  quality issues  obsolescence and others 
management judgment is required to determine reserves for obsolete or excess inventory 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the majority of our inventory is raw materials which have a long life cycle  obsolescence is not a significant factor in their valuation 
during the years ended december  and december   we recognized lower of cost or market adjustments on certain raw materials in the amounts of  and  respectively 
these expenses are included within research and development expense in the statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
impairment of long lived assets we analyze our long lived assets property  plant and equipment and definitive lived intangible assets patents for impairment  both individually and as a group  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events that might cause impairment would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or group of assets combined with a history of such losses  significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
an undiscounted cash flow analysis is calculated to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related loss is calculated using the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred impairments of our manufacturing facilities and equipment in the amounts of million  million and million  respectively  based on estimates prepared by management  as well as  in certain cases  valuation analysis by an independent firm 
research and development costs research and development costs are incurred during the process of researching and developing new products and enhancing our manufacturing processes and consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel  materials  supplies and equipment depreciation 
we expense these costs as incurred until the resulting product has been completed and tested and is ready for commercial manufacturing 
we also incur research and development expenses on federal government research and development contracts and expense as incurred 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  officers  directors  and consultants based on estimated fair values 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our statements of operations included herein 
share based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  as necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for purposes of determining estimated fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model for option awards 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
because our employee stock options may have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in 
table of contents management s opinion  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies  which could materially impact our fair value determination 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock awards at our stock price on the grant date 
the accounting guidance for share based compensation may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the accounting for share based compensation in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our loss from operations  net loss and net loss per share 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates

during the year ended december   we sold  shares of common stock under our at the market facility for aggregate net proceeds of million 
in september  we completed a firm commitment offering for  shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million 
we are in the development stage and are currently incurring significant losses from operations as we work toward commercialization 
we made payments of million in the year ended december  for property  plant and equipment 
we have commenced production at our manufacturing facility 
we do not expect that sales revenue and cash flows will be sufficient to support operations and cash requirements until we have fully implemented our new consumer products strategy 
changes in the level of expected operating losses  the timing of planned capital expenditures or other factors may negatively impact cash flows and reduce current cash and investments faster than anticipated 
during we used million in cash for operations  or an average of million per quarter 
during the fourth quarter of we used million in cash for operations 
absent any adjustments to expenses or significant additional financing  and without considering capital expenditures or significant increases in product sales at a positive margin  our cash could be depleted during the third quarter the major capital expenditures begun in were completed in in we expect to incur a base level of maintenance capital expenditures and relatively minor improvements to the existing asset base 
our primary significant long term obligation consists of a note payable of million to a financial institution secured by a mortgage on our headquarters and manufacturing building in thornton  colorado 
total payments of million  including principal and interest  will come due in additional projected product revenues are not anticipated to result in a positive cash flow position for the year overall 
as such  cash liquidity sufficient for the year ending december  will require additional financing  or a significant decrease in the operating expenditures  or some combination thereof 
we continue to accelerate sales and marketing efforts related to our consumer products strategy through increased hiring 
we have begun activities related to securing additional financing through strategic or financial investors  but there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all 
if our revenues do not increase rapidly  and or additional financing is not obtained  we will be required to significantly curtail operations to reduce costs and or sell assets 
such actions would likely have an adverse impact on our future operations 
for the year ended december   our cash used in operations was million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the net loss in  net of the non cash items  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and impairment loss  was million  approximately equal to the comparable figure of million in relatively minor differences in balance sheet accounts in and account for the remaining decrease in cash used of million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk historically  we have purchased manufacturing equipment internationally  which exposes us to foreign currency risk 
from time to time we enter into foreign currency fair value hedges utilizing forward contracts designed to match scheduled contractual payments to equipment suppliers 
our objective is to fix the dollar amount of our foreign currency denominated manufacturing equipment purchases at the time of order 
although our hedging activity is designed to fix the dollar amount to be expended  the asset purchased is recorded at the spot foreign currency rate in effect as of the date of the payment to the supplier 
the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate has been reported as gain or loss on forward contract 
we cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
all forward contracts entered into by us have been settled on the contract settlement dates  the last of which was settled in december we held no forward contracts during the years ended december   and included in restricted cash at december  is  related to  held in our bank account for future payments to equipment suppliers 
this amount was released from restriction and remitted to equipment suppliers in january we hold no funds and have no future obligations denominated in foreign currencies as of december  although our reporting currency is the us dollar  we may conduct business and incur costs in the local currencies of other countries in which we may operate  make sales and buy materials 
as a result  we are subject to currency translation risk 
further  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our future net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange losses 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
as of december   our cash equivalents consisted only of operating and savings accounts held with financial institutions 
from time to time we hold money market funds  investments in us government securities and high quality corporate securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio  and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
credit risk from time to time we hold certain financial and derivative instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk 
these consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments  and forward foreign currency option contracts 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to our financial and derivative instruments 
we place cash  cash equivalents  investments and forward foreign currency option contracts with various high quality financial institutions  and exposure is limited at any one institution 
we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counter party financial institutions
