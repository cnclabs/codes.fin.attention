table of contents proprietary platform surfactant and aerosol technologies pulmonary surfactants are protein and phospholipid compositions that form naturally in the human lung and are critical to survival and normal respiratory function 
they spread in a thin mono layer to cover the entire alveolar surface  or air sacs  of the lungs and the terminal conducting airways that lead to the air sacs and facilitate breathing by continually modifying the surface tension of the fluid that lines the inside of the lungs 
if the lungs have a surfactant deficiency  as frequently occurs in premature infants  or experience surfactant degradation  generally due to disease  lung insult or trauma  the air sacs in the lungs will tend to collapse and will not absorb sufficient oxygen  resulting in severe respiratory diseases and disorders 
in addition to lowering alveolar surface tension  surfactants contribute in other important ways to respiration including  but not limited to  lowering the surface tension of the conducting airways and maintaining airflow and airway patency keeping the airways open and expanded 
human surfactants include four known surfactant proteins  a  b  c and d 
numerous studies have established that  of the four known surfactant proteins  surfactant protein b sp b is essential for respiratory function 
in our kl surfactant  kl is a synthetic peptide that is designed to closely mimic the essential attributes of surfactant protein b sp b 
many respiratory disorders are associated with surfactant deficiency or surfactant degradation 
however  the use of surfactant therapy presently has limited application and is fda approved only for managing rds in premature infants 
currently available surfactants are derived from pig and cow lungs using a chemical extraction process 
although clinically effective  these surfactants have several potential drawbacks and have not been developed to treat broader populations and other respiratory diseases 
we believe our kl surfactant and our cag technology may expand the therapeutic options to treat previously unaddressed respiratory problems in a range of patient populations  from premature infants to adults 
we plan to develop our aerosolized kl surfactant initially for rds in premature infants and thereafter for a range of indications in neonatal  pediatric and adult critical care patient populations 
our kl surfactant technology our proprietary kl surfactant technology produces a synthetic surfactant that is structurally similar to human pulmonary surfactant and contains a proprietary synthetic peptide  kl sinapultide 
kl is a amino acid peptide that closely mimics the essential attributes of human surfactant protein b sp b  which is the surfactant protein that is most important for the proper functioning of the respiratory system 
our synthetic surfactant may be manufactured to precise specifications and formulated as a liquid instillate  lyophilized dosage form freeze dried  or aerosolized dosage form 
in october  we licensed exclusive worldwide rights to this technology  which was invented at the scripps research institute and exclusively licensed to and further developed by an affiliate of johnson johnson  inc j j 
our kl surfactant is a synthetic surfactant that can be manufactured consistently and with minimal lot to lot variability 
we also believe that our synthetic surfactant might possess pharmaceutical benefits not currently exhibited by the animal derived surfactants 
our synthetic kl surfactant has also demonstrated in preclinical studies unique characteristics  including modulation of the inflammatory process  antimicrobial properties and non immunogenicity 
we believe these characteristics will be important attributes as we develop our kl surfactant technology pipeline potentially to address a broad range of respiratory conditions that represent significant unmet medical needs 
a number of preclinical studies assessing the potential advantages of our kl surfactant technology have been reported in professional journals and presented at major medical congresses  including the following 
table of contents in september  preclinical data from a study using a well established preterm lamb model of rds was published in pediatric research 
the study found that the lungs of preterm lambs that were treated with surfaxin were more homogenously expanded both within and between lung regions  a finding that is suggestive of more uniform distribution of surfactant throughout the lung  and the lungs of surfaxin treated lambs had less cellular debris and fewer inflammatory cells when compared with the lungs of non treated lambs and the lambs treated with curosurf and survanta 
the investigators also noted lower levels of inflammatory mediators following treatment with surfaxin compared with negative controls as well as both animal derived surfactants 
the study concluded that early intervention with surfaxin may mitigate progression of pulmonary pathophysiological consequences of rds when compared with the animal derived surfactants curosurf and survanta 
in may  preclinical data from a study comparing the effects of surfaxin ls and curosurf on pulmonary function  as well as the physiologic reactions to surfactant administration in preterm lambs with rds  was published in pediatric research 
the study found that both surfactants significantly improved pulmonary function p 
however  lambs treated with surfaxin ls required significantly lower mechanical ventilator pressures to maintain pulmonary function compared with curosurf treated lambs p 
in contrast to lambs treated with surfaxin ls  lambs treated with curosurf experienced significant reductions in heart rate and rapidly increased brain oxygenation during the peridosing period p 
the investigators concluded that surfaxin ls may enable ventilation at lower mean airway pressures  thereby potentially reducing the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd  and as such may be an effective substitute for the currently marketed surfactant products 
in october  an aerosurf study was presented at the european society for paediatric research annual meeting espr 
these data were initially presented at the pediatric academic societies annual congress pas in may this preclinical study was conducted to determine which dose of aerosurf would produce the optimal physiologic response and demonstrated that aerosurf significantly improved gas exchange p  pulmonary mechanics p and lung structure integrity p  and reduced levels of inflammatory mediators in the lung p  in a dose dependent manner  in the well recognized preterm lamb model of rds 
the data also suggest that of the doses tested  aerosurf delivered during a to minute dosing interval results in the most desirable overall dosing strategy 
also at the espr  data were presented from a study demonstrating that treatment with either bolus or aerosolized kl surfactant resulted in a significant improvement in lung function and survival when treating ali in a preclinical model of ali 
these data were initially presented at the pas 
the objective of this study was to evaluate aerosolized kl surfactant in a piglet model with lung injury and subsequent reduced pulmonary function consistent with what is observed in humans with ali 
piglets were randomized to receive either endotracheal bolus kl surfactant with extubation to continuous positive airway pressure cpap  aerosolized kl surfactant while on cpap  or cpap alone control 
relative to control piglets on cpap alone  treatment with either bolus or aerosolized kl surfactant resulted in a significant improvement in both oxygenation response p and overall survival p throughout the evaluation period  with the most robust response observed in the aerosolized kl surfactant treatment group 
piglets treated with aerosolized kl surfactant had reduced tissue levels of interleukin il  a key marker of lung inflammation  compared with control piglets p 
we believe that our kl surfactant has promising novel properties and attributes that potentially may be of benefit in addressing various respiratory diseases and disorders in broad patient populations 
the clinical relevance of such attributes has not been adequately established and  accordingly  warrants further study 
in the clinical environment  our synthetic kl surfactant has demonstrated attributes that we believe are uniquely beneficial in the treatment of premature infants at risk for rds and warrant further scientific assessment to address a variety of debilitating respiratory conditions for which there currently are no or few approved therapies 

table of contents in december  the journal of pediatric pharmacology and therapeutics volume  number  published a pharmacoeconomic analysis based on data from our pivotal select and star phase clinical trials for surfaxin titled a pharmacoeconomic analysis of in hospital costs resulting from reintubation in preterm infants treated with lucinactant  beractant  or poractant alfa 
this study employed a pharamacoeconomic model that utilized observations from a post hoc analysis that examined the consequences of reintubation and the potential effect of the choice of surfactant on reintubation rates see below to assess the potential cost benefits associated with the lower rate of reintubation observed with surfaxin when compared with reintubation rates of infants treated with the current global market leading surfactants  curosurf and survanta 
the study concluded that the lower rate of reintubation  as observed in infants who received surfaxin  may result in significantly lower in hospital costs primarily related to costs associated with mechanical ventilation 
in december at the hot topics in neonatology annual meeting  data was presented from a pharmacoeconomic analysis of data published in in the journal of neonatal perinatal medicine volume  number   discussed below 
the analysis demonstrated that the previously reported reduced rate of reintubation in preterm infants treated with surfaxin may also result in an average potential hospital cost savings of  per treated infants by reducing the frequency of bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd when compared with reintubation rates of infants treated with the current global market leading surfactants  curosurf and survanta 
in addition  in may  we announced the results of an earlier pharmacoeconomic analysis that demonstrated that the lower rate of reintubation observed in infants treated with surfaxin also resulted in a potential hospital cost savings of  to  per infants 
in  the journal of neonatal perinatal medicine volume  number  published a post hoc analysis of data from our select and star phase clinical trials for surfaxin titled reintubation and risk of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants after surfactant replacement therapy 
the article evaluated the consequences of reintubation and the potential effect of the choice of surfactant on reintubation rates and subsequent clinical outcomes in premature infants 
the analysis indicates that  for preterm infants at risk for rds who received prophylactic surfactant therapy and were extubated  infants who were reintubated had significantly higher rates of six major complications of prematurity  including bronchopulmonary dysplasia bpd  a chronic lung condition  necrotizing enterocolitis a severe intestinal condition often requiring surgery and loss of bowel  sepsis  and intraventricular hemorrhage bleeding into the brain 
the analysis also indicates that infants treated with surfaxin had a significantly lower incidence of reintubation and a significantly higher incidence of survival without reintubation  compared with infants who received animal derived surfactants survanta and curosurf  the current standard of care 
kl surfactant drug product dosage form flexibility surfaxin is a liquid instillate that is administered using endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation  which is the same method of administration required for currently approved animal derived surfactants 
in addition to the liquid dosage form  we are developing our kl surfactant to potentially be available in aerosolized and lyophilized dosage forms 
we have also demonstrated through research and feasibility studies that we can aerosolize our kl surfactant and that our aerosolized kl surfactant has the following important characteristics full retention of the surface tension lowering properties of a functioning surfactant necessary to restore lung function and maintain patency of the conducting airways  full retention of the surfactant composition upon aerosolization  and drug particle size believed to be suitable for deposition into the lung 
our kl surfactant technology also can be produced in a lyophilized freeze dried dosage form that is resuspended to liquid form prior to administration 
we plan to use our lyophilized kl surfactant in our aerosurf development program 
we have conducted several experiments that demonstrate that our lyophilized kl surfactant drug product surfaxin ls retains the key characteristics of our liquid kl surfactant surfaxin and may provide additional benefits in a clinical setting  including improved ease of use for healthcare practitioners  including shortened preparation time due to potential elimination of drug product warming process prior to use  and potential elimination or reduction of continuous cold chain storage and refrigeration requirements  potential improved product stability and extended shelf life  and relatively lower viscosity  which may aid and or improve the distribution of kl surfactant throughout the lung and potentially reduce the frequency of transient peri dosing events typically observed during administration of surfactants 

table of contents our aerosolization delivery technologies capillary aerosol generator technology we have worldwide exclusive rights to our cag technology through exclusive license agreements with philip morris usa inc pmusa in the us  and philip morris products us pmpsa in the territories outside of the us each of these license agreements provides us with exclusive rights to the cag technology for use with pulmonary surfactants alone or in combination with any other pharmaceutical compound s for all respiratory diseases and conditions 
in addition  we hold in the us exclusive rights to the cag technology for use with certain non surfactant drugs to treat a wide range of pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions 
see  licensing  patents and other proprietary rights and regulatory designations patents and proprietary rights philip morris usa inc and philip morris products sa our proprietary cag technology has the potential to enable targeted  upper respiratory  airway or alveolar delivery of therapies  and has been initially designed to produce high quality aerosols for delivery to the lung 
an aerosol is created by pumping kl surfactant through a heated capillary  which converts the drug product to a vapor state 
upon exiting the capillary  the vapor stream cools and slows in velocity  yielding a dense aerosol with a defined particle size 
with this technology  we believe that we may control and adjust the particle size through device modifications and potentially changes in drug formulation 
with the assistance of our own and third party medical device engineers  we are currently optimizing the design of the cag device for anticipated clinical development in our aerosurf development program and  if approved  potential commercial use 
in studies conducted with our initial cag device and our kl surfactant  we have generated an aerosol that retains the surface tension lowering properties of a functioning surfactant  retains the surfactant composition of our liquid kl surfactant  has a drug particle size believed to be suitable for deposition into the lung  is produced at rates that can deliver therapeutic dosages in a reasonable period of time  with consistent reproducible output 
preclinical studies presented at the pas comparing our cag technology to commercially available aerosol devices indicated that our cag device generated as much as a fold higher aerosol output rate compared with the other devices studied  and produces in vivo evidence of uniform lung distribution and superior physiologic outcomes versus ncpap alone in an animal model of rds 
aerosol conducting airway connectors we have also developed our afectair device  a novel aerosol conducting airway connector 
our afectair aerosol conducting airway connector simplifies the delivery of aerosolized medications and other inhaled therapies to critical care patients requiring ventilatory support by introducing the therapy directly at the patient interface and minimizing the number of connections in the ventilator circuit 
the initial afectair device for infants is being introduced in the us in the first half of we are planning to develop a customized aerosol conducting airway connector for use in our aerosurf program for use with our cag to address rds in premature infants 
the afectair device has been registered in the us as a class i  exempt medical device 
in the eu  we believe that this device will be classified as a class iia device  which must be cleared for marketing in the eu through a european conformity ce marking process 
we are currently working with a regulatory services firm to obtain ce marking and believe that we will be cleared to market our initial afectair device in the eu by the fourth quarter of 
table of contents with the information that we gain from the introduction of the afectair device for infants in the us  we expect to develop a plan for the introduction of the afectair device for infants in the eu and other major markets 
we plan to support the launch of afectair in markets outside the us  including the eu  through arrangements with third party distributors experienced in introducing respiratory medical products into hospitals 
in addition  to benefit all critical care patients who require aerosolized medications or other inhaled therapies and who are receiving ventilatory support  we believe that our experience with the afectair device for infants will support efforts to develop one or more additional afectair devices  potentially for use in larger children and adults in picus and intensive care units icus 
at the present time  however  we are focused on gaining information and learning from the introduction of the afectair device for infants in the us thereafter  we plan to implement a regulatory and manufacturing plan that  if successful  could result in the commercial introduction of a second afectair device 
we believe that afectair has the potential to become a new standard of care for the delivery of aerosolized medications and inhaled therapies to all critical care patients 
several in vitro studies have been presented at medical meetings in the last few years that suggest that afectair improves the delivery of inhaled therapies to patients on ventilatory support  including an in vitro study that compared the dose of aerosolized albuterol sulfate delivered to a lung simulator under various neonatal ventilator settings using the afectair device for infants versus the current standard of care soc delivery system 
the investigators observed that use of afectair resulted in a statistically significant to fold increase p in the delivery of aerosolized albuterol when compared with soc  and concluded that potential clinical use of afectair may result in increased delivery of aerosolized medication to neonates receiving positive pressure ventilatory support  an in vitro study that compared the performance of the afectair device for infants with a current soc ventilator system in the delivery of nitric oxide under simulated neonatal ventilator conditions 
the simulated breathing pattern was maintained within narrow ranges and the delivery of oxygen was not different between the study conditions 
the investigators observed a to percent decrease in nitric oxide utilization requirements to achieve desired inhaled nitric oxide dose with the afectair device  compared with soc p 
the study investigators concluded that the afectair device significantly decreased the nitric oxide utilization requirements to achieve the desired inhaled nitric oxide concentration and that results of the study support further investigation of the afectair device in the delivery of other medical gases and with other ventilation methods  an in vitro study  the objective of which was to determine the particle size distribution psd using the afectair device for infants versus soc delivery system to deliver aerosolized albuterol in a neonatal ventilatory circuit 
psd is an important determination for effective aerosolized medication delivery  where the optimal psd spans the human respirable range of microns 
the investigators observed psd at or below the lower end of the respirable range when using the soc delivery system 
in contrast  the psd observed using the afectair device spanned the entire respirable range  suggesting that the potential clinical use of the afectair device may result in increased delivery and retention of aerosolized medication in the lung  an in vitro study  the objective of which was to determine if the afectair device for infants impacts respiratory system resistance in a ventilator circuit  compared with soc connectors currently used in ventilator circuits 
the investigators observed that resistance measurements were similar between afectair and the soc delivery system and concluded that afectair may be a comparably safe alternative to soc in ventilator circuits  and a study that assessed the afectair device for infants and concluded that the device reduces gas dilution when administered during cpap respiratory support without increasing flow resistance  potentially improving efficiency of aerosolized medications delivery to preterm neonates receiving positive pressure ventilator support 
we have and plan to continue to sponsor and support studies that explore the benefits of afectair devices 
we have conducted a series of studies with several inhaled therapies that have been or will be presented at medical congresses and medical meetings 
we are pleased with the results of our early studies  and believe that afectair has the potential to address a considerable unmet medical need and become a new standard of care for the delivery of aerosolized medications and inhaled therapies to patients requiring ventilatory support 

table of contents surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine the only pulmonary surfactants commercially available today were introduced in the us in the s 
all are animal derived and are approved only for rds in premature infants 
these products have not been approved for other respiratory indications 
surfaxin is the first synthetic  peptide containing surfactant approved for use in neonatal medicine and provides healthcare practitioners with an alternative to the animal derived surfactants that today are the standard of care to manage rds in premature infants 
we believe that our proprietary kl surfactant technology makes it possible  for the first time  to develop a significant pipeline of surfactant products targeted to treat a wide range of respiratory problems  including those for which there are currently few or no approved therapies 
our potential programs include respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants rds we are currently focused primarily on addressing rds in premature infants  one of the most common serious respiratory problems facing premature infants in the nicu 
rds is a condition in which premature infants are born with a lack of natural lung surfactant and are unable to absorb sufficient oxygen 
premature infants born prior to weeks gestation have not fully developed their own natural lung surfactant and therefore need treatment to sustain life 
rds is experienced in approximately half of the babies born between and weeks gestational age 
the incidence of rds approaches in babies born less than weeks gestational age 
rds can result in long term respiratory problems and death 
premature infants with rds often require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation to administer one of the currently available animal derived surfactants usually within the first hours of birth and to provide respiratory support 
unfortunately  many infants relapse following initial surfactant therapy and require reintubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation as well as supplemental oxygen  increasing their risk of developing further serious respiratory complications 
neonatologists generally try to avoid mechanically ventilating infants due to the perceived risks associated with intubation  such as the risk of trauma and the need for paralytic agents and sedation 
as a result  many neonatologists will only intubate in cases of severe respiratory disease  where the benefits of invasive surfactant administration clearly outweigh the associated risks 
for all but the very low birth weight infants with severe rds  a common ventilatory support treatment alternative to intubation and mechanical ventilation is ncpap 
unfortunately  a significant number of infants do not respond adequately to ncpap  an outcome referred to as ncpap failure  and require subsequent surfactant administration via intubation and mechanical ventilation 
several recent published studies point toward a high rate of ncpap failure in the neonatal population finer et al  early cpap versus surfactant in extremely preterm infants  n engl j med  finer  et al  nejm  morely et al  nasal cpap or intubation at birth for very preterm infants  n engl j med  morely et al  nejm 
as it is not possible to ascertain in advance which patients will experience ncpap failure  neonatologists are faced with a dilemma  because the outcome for those infants who experience ncpap failure and receive delayed surfactant therapy may not be as favorable as the outcome for those infants who receive surfactant therapy in the first hours of life 
we estimate that approximately  low birth weight premature infants are born annually in the us and at risk for rds approximately  children inclusive of the us  major european medical markets and japan 
of the us total  we estimate that approximately  are diagnosed with rds and approximately  are treated with surfactant replacement therapy  for either the prevention or treatment of rds 
we also estimate that approximately  infants receive early ncpap as an initial respiratory support therapy 
recent peer reviewed  published studies report rates of ncpap failure ranging between of children receiving early ncpap  depending on gestational age evaluated finer et al  nejm  morely et al  nejm 
we believe that the neonatal medical community increasingly recognizes the potential benefits of i a synthetic  peptide containing surfactant  such as surfaxin and surfaxin ls  and more importantly  ii a less invasive method of delivering surfactant  such as aerosurf  to treat premature infants at risk of suffering from respiratory disorders 
while the current rds market for surfactants is estimated to be approximately million annually in the us and million annually worldwide  we believe that this market has been constrained by the lack of further development of animal derived surfactants coupled with the risks associated with surfactant administration 
we believe that surfaxin  and  if approved surfaxin ls and aerosurf have the potential over time to displace animal derived products and take a substantial share of the markets in which they are available 

table of contents surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants at high risk for rds surfaxin is the first synthetic  peptide containing surfactant that is structurally similar to pulmonary surfactant and mimics the surface active properties of human surfactant 
surfaxin is a liquid instillate and is administered usually within the first hours of birth via endotracheal tube supported by mechanical ventilation for respiratory support 
surfaxin represents the first synthetic  peptide containing surfactant approved for use in neonatal medicine 
our nda for surfaxin was filed with the fda in april and is supported by a phase pivotal trial select for the prevention of rds in premature infants 
the select trial enrolled  patients and was designed as a multinational  multicenter  randomized  masked  controlled  prophylaxis  event driven  superiority trial to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of surfaxin over exosurf  an approved  non protein containing synthetic surfactant 
survanta  a surfactant derived from cow lung and a leading surfactant used in the us  served as a reference arm in the trial 
key trial results were assessed by an independent  blinded  adjudication committee comprised of leading neonatologists and pediatric radiologists 
this committee provided a consistent and standardized method for assessing critical efficacy data in the trial 
an independent data safety monitoring board was responsible for monitoring the overall safety of the trial and no major safety issues were identified 
data from the select study demonstrate that surfaxin is significantly more effective in the prevention of rds  death due to rds  and the development of certain severe respiratory problems as compared to exosurf  the primary comparator 
although the reference arm using survanta was not the primary focus of comparison  significantly fewer infants treated with surfaxin died due to rds compared with infants treated with survanta 
we also conducted a supportive  multinational  multicenter  prophylaxis  randomized  controlled  masked  phase clinical trial star which enrolled patients and was designed as a non inferiority trial comparing surfaxin to curosurf  a surfactant derived from pig lung and the leading surfactant used throughout the developed world 
the star trial demonstrated the overall safety and non inferiority of surfaxin compared with curosurf 
the select and star trials  as well as a pooled phase analysis  have been presented at several international medical meetings and the results from the two studies were published in pediatrics  the official journal of the american academy of pediatrics and a premier medical journal for pediatric healthcare practitioners 
post hoc analysis of data from our select and star phase clinical trials reveals that premature infants with rds who were extubated after treatment with surfactant and who later required reintubation had a significantly higher rate of mortality than those infants who did not require reintubation 
the data also indicate that premature infants treated with surfaxin required less reintubation compared to those treated with survanta and curosurf 
although the data indicated that the infants treated with surfaxin were observed to have a statistically significant lower incidence of reintubation than those infants treated with comparator surfactants  the clinical relevance of this finding has not been adequately established and  accordingly  warrants further study 
on march   the fda granted marketing approval for surfaxin 
in the third quarter of  during a routine review of the results and processes related to the analytical testing and quality control of surfaxin drug product  we determined that one of our analytical chemistry methods used to assess surfaxin drug product conformance to specifications required improvement and that an update to product specifications was needed 
we improved and validated the analytical chemistry method and submitted updated product specifications to the fda 
as a result of these efforts  we delayed the commercial availability of surfaxin drug product 
if we are able to successfully conclude our planned activities and receive confirmation of our updated product specifications from the fda within our anticipated timeline  we anticipate that surfaxin drug product will be commercially available in the second quarter of to facilitate proper administration of surfaxin  we plan to make available to hospitals our warming cradle dry block heating device that is designed to warm drug vials at the same temperature that is designated in the surfaxin prescribing information 
warming cradle dry block heater is registered with the fda as a class i  exempt laboratory medical device 
our commercial organization will work with hospitals medical device control units to gain the appropriate clearances to make warming cradle dry block heaters available to nicus for use with surfaxin 

table of contents aerosurf for rds in premature infants aerosurf is a drug device combination product that produces our kl surfactant in aerosolized form using our cag and drug delivery technologies 
premature infants with rds currently are treated with surfactants that can only be administered by endotracheal intubation supported with mechanical ventilation  both invasive procedures that frequently result in serious respiratory conditions and complications 
in many cases today  neonatologists will not treat infants who could benefit from surfactant therapy if the perceived potential benefits of surfactant therapy are outweighed by the risks associated with such invasive administration procedures 
aerosurf  if approved  may potentially be administered through less invasive ncpap  and is being developed to potentially reduce or eliminate the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation 
we believe that aerosurf holds the promise to significantly expand the use of our kl surfactant in neonatal respiratory medicine by potentially providing neonatologists with a means to administer kl surfactant to infants without subjecting them to the invasive procedures associated with administration of currently approved surfactants 
in  prior to the initiation of our aerosurf program  we announced the results of a pilot phase clinical trial using aerosolized kl surfactant for the prevention of rds in premature infants  which was designed as an open label  multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility  safety and tolerability of aerosolized kl surfactant delivered using a commercially available aerosolization device aeroneb pro via ncpap within minutes of birth over a three hour duration 
the study showed that it is feasible to deliver our aerosolized kl surfactant via ncpap and that the treatment was generally safe and well tolerated 
we have since conducted or sponsored a number of studies evaluating aerosurf and our aerosolized kl surfactant drug product 
see  proprietary platform surfactant and aerosol technologies our kl surfactant technology 
we are currently developing aerosurf using our cag technology 
see  proprietary platform surfactant and aerosol technologies our aerosolization delivery technologies capillary aerosol generator technology 
in june  we entered into a research and development services agreement with battelle  which has a particular expertise in developing and integrating aerosol devices using innovative and advanced technologies 
battelle has agreed to provide technical support and expertise and assist our medical device engineering team in the development of cag device components in phased programs focused on design  testing  and manufacture of clinic ready cag devices for our planned aerosurf phase clinical trials 
we have retained authority for all final decisions and all responsibility for the formulation  design  manufacture  assembly  packaging  marketing  distribution and sale of our products

in addition to our internal resources  we have engaged regulatory consultants to assist us in implementing and  as needed  refining this development plan as we anticipate filing an investigational new drug ind application in advance of initiating the first part of our phase clinical program in the fourth quarter of we also plan to retain regulatory consultants to assist us in engaging international regulatory authorities regarding the aerosurf development plan 
we believe that aerosurf is a highly promising program 
in december  the national institutes of health nih awarded us phase i of a fast track small business innovation research sbir grant to support up to  of aerosurf development activities 
following conclusion of the phase i grant activities  we anticipate that the nih may potentially award us a phase ii of the sbir grant  which could provide up to an additional million to support further aerosurf development 
with the knowledge that we gain from our development activities to treat premature infants with rds  we plan to leverage our technology platform to potentially address several respiratory conditions affecting pediatric and adult patient populations

table of contents lyophilized surfaxin for rds in premature infants surfaxin ls we are developing a lyophilized freeze dried dosage form of our kl surfactant that is stored as a powder and resuspended to liquid form prior to use with the objective of improving ease of use for healthcare practitioners  as well as potentially to prolong shelf life and eliminate the need for cold chain storage 
we are engaged in a technology transfer of our lyophilized kl surfactant manufacturing process to a cmo that has expertise in lyophilized products  and we expect that it will manufacture drug product for use in our preclinical and clinical development activities 
our development plan is intended initially to support the use of our lyophilized kl surfactant in our aerosurf development program 
we have discussed with the fda a proposed development program for surfaxin ls and expect to engage in further discussions with the fda 
we are assessing a potential development plan intended to gain marketing authorization for surfaxin ls  a lyophilized dosage form of surfaxin  in the us and potentially in other major markets 
serious respiratory indications associated with inflammation of the lungs many respiratory diseases are associated with an inflammatory event that causes surfactant dysfunction and a loss of patency of the conducting airways 
scientific data support the premise that the therapeutic use of surfactants in aerosol form has the ability to reestablish airway patency  improve pulmonary mechanics and act as an anti inflammatory 
we believe that our proprietary aerosolized kl surfactant technology may be used to address debilitating respiratory disorders such as ali and  possibly in the future copd 
as resources permit  we may invest in or support third party studies of these indications 
if a proof of concept should be established  we will then determine whether to seek strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements or utilize other financial alternatives to fund their further development and or commercialization  if approved 
there can be no assurance that we will invest or support studies in these indications  that any such efforts will be successful  or that we will be able to conclude any such strategic alliance  collaboration arrangement or secure any financial alternative 
we believe that these investments could potentially address significant unmet medical needs and redefine respiratory medicine 
acute lung injury ali ali is associated with conditions that either directly or indirectly injure the air sacs of the lung 
ali is a syndrome of inflammation and increased permeability of the lungs with an associated breakdown of the lungs surfactant layer 
among the causes of ali are complications typically associated with certain major surgeries  mechanical ventilator induced lung injury often referred to as vili  smoke inhalation  pneumonia and sepsis 
there are a significant number of patients at risk in the us for ali annually and there are no currently approved therapies other than supportive respiratory care 
we believe that our aerosolized kl surfactant may potentially be effective as a preventive measure to treat patients at risk for ali 
we have conducted research and preclinical studies in collaboration with a prominent academic investigator to assess the use of our kl surfactant to potentially address ali in an animal model 
this prophylactic approach may reduce the number of patients requiring costly intensive care therapy  eliminate long periods of therapy and generate cost savings in the hospital setting 
in september  we announced initiation of four research projects designed to explore the use of kl surfactants in the prevention and treatment of ali 
we believe that our kl surfactant may be an effective intervention for people at risk for  or with  ali 
we are collaborating with leading research institutions in a series of preclinical studies funded through various us government sponsored  biodefense related initiatives 
these studies include a collaboration with the university of pennsylvania funded by the nih s national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid to assess the ability of kl surfactant to mitigate effects of acute radiation exposure to the lung  a collaboration with the university of rochester to evaluate the use of kl surfactant to protect the lung in a radiation induced multi organ dysfunction animal model  a collaboration with a facility of the us department of defense through the nih office of the director and the countermeasures against chemical threats counteract program assessing the utility of kl surfactant for the treatment of chemical induced ali  and a program funded by niaid investigating the use of kl surfactant as a treatment for influenza induced ali 

table of contents chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd copd is an incurable  chronic respiratory disorder that includes both emphysema and chronic bronchitis and is characterized by obstruction to airflow that interferes with normal breathing  inflammation  mucus plugs formation  infection  and disruption of the normal lung architecture 
we believe that our kl surfactant has unique attributes  including potential modulation of the inflammatory process and anti microbial properties  that  when combined with a potential ability to enhance mucus clearance may be an effective treatment for copd  potentially improving outcomes for these very ill patients 
cystic fibrosis cf cf is a life threatening genetic disease affecting the respiratory and other body systems 
cf is characterized by a genetic mutation that results in the production of thick  viscous mucus that is difficult to clear from the airways of the lung and typically leads to life threatening respiratory infections 
preclinical and exploratory clinical studies suggest that therapeutic surfactants may improve lung function by loosening mucus plugs and enhancing mucociliary clearance 
cf is the most common  life threatening genetic disorder in the us  occurring in approximately one in every  caucasian live births 
cf affects approximately  patients in the us and nearly  worldwide 
to date  treatment of pulmonary conditions in cf primarily includes antibiotics to address lung infection and airway clearance therapies to break down and remove mucus 
life expectancy for cf has more than doubled in the past years to age  due to significant advances in research and care 
our aerosolized kl surfactant was evaluated in an investigator initiated phase a clinical trial in cf patients conducted at the university of north carolina with the support of the cystic fibrosis foundation to evaluate whether aerosolized kl surfactant is safe and well tolerated in patients with mild to moderate cf lung disease  and to assess the short term effectiveness via improvement in mucociliary clearance of our aerosolized kl surfactant 
the trial demonstrated that aerosolized kl surfactant delivery to cf patients was feasible  generally safe and well tolerated and was not associated with serious adverse events 
both aerosolized kl surfactant and the active comparator  aerosolized saline control  produced a marked  significant p increase from patient baseline in mucociliary clearance measured one hour after the last dose in both whole lung and peripheral lung compartments 
we believe these results support further scientific assessment of a potential complementary therapeutic role for aerosolized kl surfactant specifically targeting airway mucus adhesion 
additionally  in the fda granted us orphan drug designation for the treatment of cf with kl surfactant 
we believe that our novel synthetic  peptide containing surfactant has unique attributes  potentially including anti microbial properties  modulation of the inflammatory process  and lack of immunogenicity  that when combined with a potential ability to enhance mucociliary clearance in cf lung disease  may advance the treatment of cf and improve treatment outcomes for these very ill patients 
while our near term plans are focused on treating rds in a critical care setting  we will continue to support investigator initiated studies that explore the utility of using our kl surfactant to treat cf and other diseases 
business operations research and development our research and development activities are focused on developing our proprietary kl surfactant  cag  and aerosol delivery technologies into a series of pipeline programs that potentially could support a significant respiratory critical care franchise 
we are initially focused on rds in premature infants 
we continually evaluate our research and development priorities in light of a number of factors  including our cash flow requirements and financial liquidity  the potential for development partnerships and collaboration agreements  the results obtained in our research and development activities  advances in technology  and our ability to secure necessary capital 
in connection with our evaluations  we modify and adapt our research and development plans from time to time and anticipate that we will continue to do so 

table of contents we have managed and in plan to continue closely managing our expenditures 
we plan to focus our research and development resources on our rds programs  primarily aerosurf  and  if we secure the necessary capital  surfaxin ls 
we expect to initiate a phase clinical program for aerosurf in the fourth quarter of we also plan to conduct preclinical studies to assess the utility and potential benefits of the afectair device for infants 
after we have completed the commercial introduction of the afectair device for infants in the us  we expect to implement a development plan that could result in a second afectair to address serious critical care respiratory conditions of larger children and adults in picus and icus 
for our rds programs  an important objective for us is to enter into a significant strategic alliance  predominantly focused on the european union eu 
we seek strategic partners that have broad experience in the designated markets  including regulatory and product development expertise as well as  if our products are approved  an ability to commercialize our products 
in addition to development and commercial support  such alliances typically also would provide us with financial resources to support our efforts  potentially in the form of upfront payments  milestone payments  commercialization royalties and a sharing of research and development expenses 
in our discussions to date  the primary focus of our discussions has been on aerosurf 
we also would consider various financing alternatives or collaboration arrangements that would provide infusions of capital and other resources needed to advance our kl surfactant development programs 
we are also assessing a potential development plan intended to gain marketing authorization for surfaxin ls  a lyophilized dosage form of surfaxin  in the united states us and potentially other major markets 
we may also seek strategic alliances and or collaboration arrangements to support the potential commercial introduction of surfaxin and  if approved  surfaxin ls in countries where regulatory marketing authorization is facilitated by the information contained in our surfaxin nda approved by the fda 
although we are considering several potential opportunities  there can be no assurance that any strategic alliance or other financing alternatives or collaboration arrangement will be successfully concluded 
until we secure sufficient strategic and financial resources to support the continuing development of our pipeline programs and support our operations  we will continue to focus our resources on rds programs and pace investments in potential non rds pipeline programs 
see  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we will continue to consider supporting investigator initiated studies  and may invest opportunistically in studies of other potential kl surfactant pipeline programs that would target adult and other indications  such as ali and cf 
we believe that these programs could represent significant market opportunities 
if we were able to demonstrate proof of concept for any of these indications  we would consider whether to develop these products through potential strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements  or utilize other financial alternatives to fund their further development and commercialization  if approved 
there can be no assurance that we will pursue such investments or  if we do  that we will succeed in demonstrating proof of concept or entering into any such alliance

manufacturing and distribution kl surfactant our kl surfactant products  including surfaxin  must be manufactured in compliance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp established by the fda and other international regulatory authorities  as applicable 
surfaxin is a complex drug product comprised of four active ingredients 
it must be aseptically manufactured at our facility as a sterile  liquid suspension and requires ongoing monitoring of drug product stability and conformance to specifications 
our drug products are manufactured by combining active pharmaceutical ingredients apis  such as kl  which is provided by bachem california  inc  and other apis  including certain lipids that are provided by suppliers such as corden pharma from a facility that was owned previously by genzyme pharmaceuticals and avanti polar lipids  inc we currently obtain our apis from single source providers  although we plan to qualify secondary suppliers over the next to months 
our risk of losing a source of supply is somewhat mitigated by our strategy to maintain minimum inventories of all apis 
suppliers of our primary packaging components and excipients used in our manufacturing process include west pharmaceutical services  inc  gerresheimer glass inc and spectrum chemical mfg 
corp 
our primary packaging components and excipients are generally readily available from multiple sources 
we have established arrangements with asd specialty healthcare inc and integrated commercialization solutions  inc ics  affiliates of amerisourcebergen specialty group  for warehousing  distribution and related services 
ics is our third party logistics provider and assists us with inventory tracking  customer service  order management  distribution  contract and accounts receivable management  certain financial management services and other similar services 
we have also identified a provider of vial labeling and secondary packaging services for our surfaxin commercial drug product and have negotiated and are finalizing an agreement 
our manufacturing facility in totowa  new jersey  consists of pharmaceutical manufacturing and development space that is designed for the manufacture and filling of sterile pharmaceuticals in compliance with cgmp 
see  item properties 
these operations are configured and approved to produce commercial surfaxin drug product 
these operations also produce surfaxin for use in our research and development activities 
owning our manufacturing operations has provided us with direct operational control as we worked through manufacturing development activities and produced surfaxin drug product for preclinical activities supporting our efforts to gain regulatory marketing approval for surfaxin in the us we also are conducting a technology transfer of the surfaxin ls dosage form manufacturing process to a cgmp compliant cmo with expertise in lyophilized formulations 

table of contents in january  the fda completed a pre approval inspection pai of our manufacturing facility and issued an establishment inspection report indicating an approval recommendation for our surfaxin nda 
in march  the fda granted us marketing approval for surfaxin 
our manufacturing operation also includes our analytical testing and quality system 
we have consolidated all of our in house analytical development and quality control activities in our analytical and technical support laboratory at our headquarters in warrington  pennsylvania 
we conduct release testing of all apis as well as release and stability testing of surfaxin clinical and commercial drug product supply 
in the third quarter of  during a review of the results and processes related to the analytical testing and quality control of surfaxin drug product  we determined that one of our analytical chemistry methods used to assess drug product conformance to specifications required improvement and that an update to product specifications will be necessary 
we improved and validated the analytical chemistry method  and submitted updated product specifications to the fda 
as a result of these efforts  we delayed the commercial availability of surfaxin drug product 
although there can be no assurance  if we successfully conclude our planned activities and receive confirmation of our updated product specifications from the fda within our anticipated timeline in the second quarter of  we believe that we are on track to manufacture surfaxin drug product for commercial use in the second quarter of we also perform research and development work at our warrington analytical and technical support laboratory for our lyophilized and aerosolized kl surfactant dosage forms as well as other potential formulations of our kl surfactant  and in support of our efforts to identify and protect our intellectual property 
in addition  we have a microbiology laboratory at our totowa facility to support the manufacture of our drug product candidates 
we also maintain a medical device development laboratory with resources and capabilities that our internal development engineering team uses for ongoing preclinical development activities for aerosurf and our aerosol delivery technologies  while at the same time controlling the related expense and conserving our financial resources 
in addition  to further support our development activities and quality programs  we work with a number of third party institutions and laboratories that perform various studies as well as quality control release and stability testing and other activities related to our kl surfactant development and manufacturing activities 
among these  our bat release and stability testing is conducted at a laboratory owned by the university of california  san diego  school of medicine  department of pediatrics 
at the present time  several of these laboratories are single source providers 
we expect over the next months to implement a plan to identify and potentially qualify additional sources to meet our key release testing and stability requirements

even if we obtain patents to protect our products  those patents may not be sufficiently broad or they may expire and others could then compete with us  intellectual property rights of third parties could limit our ability to develop and market our products  and if we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements  we could lose the rights to our products

trade secrets in addition to our patent exclusivities  we rely on trade secrets to protect and maintain our competitive position 
we take measures to protect and maintain our trade secrets and know how licensed to us or developed by us by entering in confidentiality agreements with third parties 
our trade secrets and know how include information related to manufacturing processes for our drug products and devices  analytical methods and procedures  research and development activities  provisional patent applications  as well as certain information provided to fda that was not made public which relates to our regulatory activities and clinical trials 
other regulatory designations new drug product exclusivity surfaxin is expected to receive at least three years of marketing exclusivity as a new drug product based on the new data from the select and star clinical trials 
in addition  the fda has indicated that our surfaxin drug product also qualifies as a new molecular entity  which we expect may provide extended marketing exclusivity of five years 
however  the fda has not made its final determination as to the length of the exclusivity period for surfaxin 
orphan drug and orphan medicinal product designations orphan drugs are pharmaceutical products that are intended to address diseases affecting fewer than  patients in the us the office of orphan product development of the fda grants certain advantages to the sponsors of orphan drugs including  but not limited to  seven years of market exclusivity upon approval of the drug  certain tax incentives for clinical research and grants to fund testing of the drug 
the fda has granted orphan drug designation for surfaxin for the treatment of rds in premature infants 
however  as our indication for surfaxin is for the prevention  rather than treatment  of rds  we filed a request with the fda to allow for application of this designation to surfaxin 
we were advised in that the fda had denied our request 
if we develop aerosurf or surfaxin ls for the treatment of rds  this orphan drug designation may apply for that indication 
the fda has also granted orphan drug designation to i surfaxin for the prevention and treatment of bpd in premature infants  ii our kl surfactant for the treatment of ards in adults  and iii our kl surfactant for the treatment of cf 

table of contents the european commission grants orphan medicinal product designation for pharmaceutical products for the diagnosis  prevention or treatment of a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than in  people which provides for exclusive marketing rights for indications in europe for years subject to revision after six years following marketing approval by the ema 
in addition  the designation would enable us to receive regulatory assistance in the further development process  and to access reduced regulatory fees throughout its marketing life 
we have received orphan medicinal product designation for i surfaxin for the prevention and treatment of rds in premature infants  ii our kl surfactant for the treatment of ali in adults which in this circumstance encompasses ards  and iii our kl surfactant for the treatment of cf 
fast track designations designation as a fast track product means that the fda has determined that the drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs  and that the fda will facilitate and expedite the development and review of the application for the approval of the product 
the fda generally will review an nda for a drug granted fast track designation within six months 
the fda has granted fast track designation for i surfaxin for the prevention and treatment of bpd in premature infants  and ii our kl surfactant for the treatment of ards 
competition we are engaged in the highly competitive fields of pharmaceutical research and development 
competition from numerous existing companies and others entering the fields in which we operate is intense and expected to increase 
we expect to compete with conventional pharmaceutical companies  among others 
most of these companies have substantially greater research and development  manufacturing  marketing  financial  technological personnel and managerial resources than we do 
acquisitions of competing companies by large pharmaceutical or health care companies could further enhance such competitors financial  marketing and other resources 
moreover  competitors that are able to complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products before we do may enjoy a significant competitive advantage over us 
there are also existing therapies that may compete with the products we are developing 
see  item a risk factors our industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors  which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete 
currently  the fda has approved surfactants as replacement therapy only for the prevention and treatment of rds in premature infants 
administration of these surfactants requires invasive intubation and mechanical ventilation 
the most commonly used of these approved surfactants are curosurf poractant alfa  which is derived from a chemical extraction process of porcine pig lung  and survanta beractant  which is derived from a chemical extraction process of bovine cow lung 
curosurf is marketed in europe by chiesi farmaceutici spa and in the spa by cornerstone therapeutics inc in addition  chiesi has published the results of a preclinical study indicating that it is engaged in an early stage effort to develop a synthetic surfactant sato a  ikegami m sp b and sp c containing new synthetic surfactant for treatment of extremely immature lamb lung

table of contents with respect to our drug delivery technologies  efforts to aerosolize animal derived surfactants have not been very successful 
recent studies suggest that to aerosolize a surfactant for delivery to premature infants  it is necessary to optimize the aerosol to a particular particle size range  use an aerosol generator with characteristics that are compatible with the patient s breathing  and employ a delivery system that delivers sufficient drug product to the patient mazela  et 
al  aerosolized surfactants  current opinion in pediatrics   finer  et 
al  an open label  pilot study of aerosurf combined with ncpap to prevent rds in preterm neonate  journal of aerosol  medicine and pulmonary drug delivery  volume  number  
there are a number of device manufacturers with aerosolization expertise  including pari and aerogen 
these companies manufacture aerosol devices such as nebulizers  aerosol masks  and compressors 
pari  for example  has provided nebulizers for use in clinical research and in commercial product for several companies 
aerogen manufactures a number of aerosolization devices  including a disposable  single patient nebulizer and a reusable  multi patient nebulizer 
our afectair devices are novel aerosol conducting airway connectors that are intended to replace standard connectors in the ventilatory circuit 
we currently are not aware of any efforts on the part of any of these or other companies to develop an alternative to afectair 
government regulation the development  manufacture  distribution  marketing and advertising of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the us  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
gaining regulatory approval of a drug product candidate requires the expenditure of substantial resources over an extended period 
as a result  larger companies with greater financial resources will likely have a competitive advantage over us 
drug product regulations development activities to gain regulatory approval of our kl surfactant technology pipeline products  we must demonstrate  through experiments  preclinical studies and clinical trials that each of our drug product candidates meets the safety and efficacy standards established by the fda and other international regulatory authorities 
in addition  we and our suppliers and cmos must demonstrate that all development related laboratory  clinical and manufacturing practices comply with regulations of the fda  other international regulators and local regulators 
regulations establish standards for such things as drug substances  materials and excipients  medical device components  subassemblies and device manufacture  drug manufacturing operations and facilities and analytical laboratories and medical device development laboratories processes and environments  in each instance  in connection with research  development  testing  manufacture  quality control  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion  and distribution of product candidates  on a product by product basis 
see  item a risk factors the regulatory approval process for our products is expensive and time consuming and the outcome is uncertain 
we may not obtain required regulatory approvals for the commercialization of our products 
preclinical studies and clinical trials development testing generally begins with laboratory testing and experiments  as well as research studies using animal models to obtain preliminary information on a product s efficacy and to identify any safety issues 
the results of these studies are compiled along with other information in an investigational new drug ind application  which is filed with the fda 
after resolving any questions raised by the fda  which may involve additional testing and animal studies  clinical trials may begin 
regulatory agencies in other countries generally require a clinical trial application cta to be submitted and approved before each trial can commence in each country 

table of contents clinical trials normally are conducted in three sequential phases and may take a number of years to complete 
phase consists of testing the drug product in a small number of humans  normally healthy volunteers  to determine preliminary safety and tolerable dose range 
phase usually involves studies in a limited patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug product in humans having the disease or medical condition for which the product is indicated  determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and identify possible common adverse effects and safety risks 
phase consists of additional controlled testing at multiple clinical sites to establish clinical safety and effectiveness in an expanded patient population of geographically dispersed test sites to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship for administering the product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling 
phase clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication 
the conduct of clinical trials is subject to stringent medical and regulatory requirements 
the time and expense required to establish clinical sites  provide training and materials  establish communications channels and monitor a trial over a long period are substantial 
the conduct of clinical trials at institutions located around the world is subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials  which vary widely from country to country 
delays or terminations of clinical trials could result from a number of factors  including stringent enrollment criteria  slow rate of enrollment  size of patient population  having to compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients  geographical considerations and others 
clinical trials are monitored by the regulatory agencies as well as medical advisory and standards boards  which could determine at any time to reevaluate  alter  suspend  or terminate a trial based upon accumulated data  including data concerning the occurrence of adverse health events during or related to the treatment of patients enrolled in the trial  and the regulator s or monitor s risk benefit assessment with respect to patients enrolled in the trial 
if they occur  such delays or suspensions could have a material impact on our kl surfactant technology development programs 
see  item a risk factors our research and development programs for aerosurf and surfaxin ls involve significant risks and uncertainties that are inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  and our clinical trials may be delayed  or fail  which will harm our business 
regulatory review the results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the fda in an nda  with comparable filings submitted to other international regulators 
after the initial submission  the fda has a period of time in which it must determine if the nda is complete 
if an nda is accepted for filing  following the fda s review  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information  or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
if the fda grants approval  the approval may be conditioned upon the conduct of post marketing clinical trials or other studies to confirm the product s safety and efficacy for its intended use 
until the fda has issued its approval  no marketing activities can be conducted in the us similar regulations apply in other countries 
after an nda is submitted  although the statutory period provided for the fda s review is less than one year  dealing with questions or concerns of the agency and  taking into account the statutory timelines governing such communications  may result in review periods that can take several years 
the fda may not accept an nda and may deliver what is referred to as a complete response letter that describes the shortcomings of the application  including whether the applicant should consider additional clinical trials  which could have the effect of terminating a development program 
manufacturing standards the fda and other international regulators establish standards and routinely inspect facilities and equipment  analytical and quality laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and monitoring of products 
prior to granting approval of a drug product  the fda will conduct a pre approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities  and the facilities of suppliers  to determine that the drug product is manufactured in accordance with cgmp regulations and product specifications 
following approval  the fda will conduct periodic inspections 
if  in connection with a facility inspection  the fda determines that a manufacturer does not comply with cgmp  the fda will issue an inspection report citing the potential violations and may seek a range of remedies  from administrative sanctions  including the suspension of our manufacturing operations  to seeking civil or criminal penalties 
in connection with our efforts to gain fda marketing approval for surfaxin  in january  the fda conducted a pre approval inspection of our totowa  new jersey manufacturing operations and our analytical and testing laboratory in warrington  pennsylyania  and other of the quality assurance quality control facilities for surfaxin including those of our third party raw material suppliers and testing laboratories 
on february   the fda issued an eir recommending approval of our totowa manufacturing operations for the manufacture of surfaxin 
the fda may determine to conduct such inspections at any time and for any reason  including in connection with our recent notification that one of our analytical chemistry methods used to assess drug product conformance to specifications required improvement and our submission of updated product specifications for surfaxin 
see  item a risk factors manufacturing problems potentially could cause us to delay preclinical or clinical programs  or  if our products are approved  product launch  or cause us to experience shortages of product inventories  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents international approvals in addition to seeking regulatory approval to market our products in the us  we also expect to apply for such approval with other international regulators 
regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in approach to that of the us but are not fully harmonized 
with certain exceptions  although the approval of the fda carries considerable weight  international regulators are not bound by the findings of the fda and there is a risk that foreign regulators will not accept a clinical trial design or may require additional data or other information not requested by the fda 
in europe  there is a centralized procedure available under which the ema will conduct the application review and recommend marketing approval to the european commission  or not  for the sale of drug products in the eu countries 
post approval regulation following the grant of marketing approval  the fda regulates the marketing and promotion of drug products 
promotional claims are generally limited to the information provided in the product package insert for each drug product  which is negotiated with the fda during the nda review process 
in addition  the fda enforces regulations designed to guard against conflicts of interest  misleading advertising and improper compensation of prescribing physicians 
the fda will review  among other things  direct to consumer advertising  prescriber directed advertising and promotional materials  sales representative communications to healthcare professionals  promotional programming and promotional activities on the internet 
the fda will also monitor scientific and educational activities 
if the fda determines that a company has promoted a product for an unapproved off label use  or engaged in other violations  it may issue a regulatory letter and may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals 
enforcement actions may also potentially include product seizures  injunctions and civil or criminal penalties 
the consequences of such an action and the related adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on a developer s ability to market its drug and its business as a whole 
regulation and enforcement of advertising and promotion by institutions other than fda are discussed below 
following approval  the fda and other international regulators will continue to monitor data to assess the safety and efficacy of an approved drug 
a post approval discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or a recall or withdrawal of the product from the market  as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions 
similar oversight is provided by international regulators 
combination drug device products combination drug products such as aerosurf and potentially other aerosolized kl surfactant drug products are similarly subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the us and in other countries 
combination products involve review of two or more regulated components that might normally be reviewed by regulatory authorities having different expertise and may involve more complicated and time consuming regulatory coordination  approvals and clearances than a drug product alone 
in the us  our aerosolized kl surfactant combination drug device product will be reviewed by the center for drug evaluation and research cder of the fda  with input from the center for devices and radiological health cdrh 
among other things  we will have to demonstrate compliance with both cgmp  to ensure that the drug possesses adequate strength  quality  identity and purity  and applicable quality system regulations qsr  to ensure that the device is in compliance with applicable performance standards 
although cgmp and qsr overlap in many respects  each is tailored to the particular characteristics of the types of products to which they apply  such that compliance with both cgmp and qsr may present unique problems and manufacturing challenges 
medical device products to varying degrees  each of the regulatory agencies having oversight over medical devices  including the fda and comparable foreign regulators  has laws and regulations governing the development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  marketing  and distribution of medical devices 
in the us  medical device products are subject to regulation that is intended to calibrate regulatory requirements to the issues of safety and efficacy presented by specific devices 
medical devices are classified into one of three classes based on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device 
the three classes and the requirements that apply to them are i class i general controls  with exemptions and without exemptions  ii class ii general controls and special controls  with exemptions and without exemptions  and iii class iii general controls and premarket marketing authorization 
the class to which a device is assigned determines the process that applies for gaining marketing authorization 
most class i devices are exempt from premarket notification k  most class ii devices require premarket notification k  and most class iii devices require premarket marketing authorization 
as noted below  we have determined that our afectair device qualities as a class i medical device 
we have not determined at this time under which classification our cag device and related componentry will fall 
a brief summary overview of the three classifications is set forth below 

table of contents exempt class i medical device prior to marketing an exempt class i medical device  the manufacturer must register its establishment  list the generic category or classification name of the medical device being marketed and pay a registration fee 
after consulting with our regulatory experts  in february  we registered our afectair device as an exempt class i medical device 
we will be required to update and renew our registration annually 
k clearance process a class ii medical device requires fda clearance in the us pursuant to the k clearance process 
the k clearance process is available to medical device developers that can demonstrate that their device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device 
in this process  the developer would be required to submit data that supports the equivalence claim and wait for an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence to another legally marketed medical device before distributing the device for commercial sale 
modifications to cleared medical devices can be made without using the k process if the changes do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness 
pre market marketing authorization a more rigorous and time consuming process applicable to class iii medical devices  known as pre market marketing authorization pma  would require the developer to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective 
this is done by presenting data regarding design  materials  bench and animal testing  and human clinical data for the medical device 
the fda will authorize commercial release of a class iii medical device if it determines there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe and effective 
this determination is based on benefit outweighing risk for the population intended to be treated with the device 
this process is much more detailed  time consuming and expensive than the k clearance process 
we do not believe that we will be required to file an application for pma 
european compliance ce marking process the european union has comparable regulations to the fda for the registration or marketing authorization of medical devices 
we believe that in the european union our afectair device qualifies as a class iia device  which requires us to obtain a ce mark by filing a statement of registration 
we must first seek a review of a third party notified body that will conduct an iso quality management system certification audit to ensure that our manufacturers and we are in compliance with the standard 
if the audit is successful  the notified body will grant iso certification  which is a requisite to pursue ce marking for our afectair device 
we obtained iso certification in early  and we are currently working a regulatory services firm to obtain ce marking 
the regulatory services firm will assist us with compiling the required technical file  labeling review  a clinical evaluation report to support ce marking  design control and quality system implementation  subcontractor audit and general regulatory consulting 
in addition  in the european union we will have to designate a single authorized representative located in the european union to interact with the local authorities and respond to technical document requests 
the authorized representative will be responsible for preparing supplemental submissions to member states that have additional requirements for marketing authorization 
other regulatory requirements pervasive and continuing regulation after a device is placed on the market  numerous regulatory requirements may apply 
these include product listing and establishment registration  which helps facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory action  product listing and establishment registration  which helps facilitate fda inspections and other regulatory action  
table of contents quality system regulation qsr  which is the medical device term for good manufacturing practices  requires manufacturers  including third party manufacturers  to follow stringent design  testing  control  documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process  labeling regulations and fda prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared  unapproved or off label use or indication  clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a significant change in the safety or efficacy of our cleared devices  medical device reporting regulations  which require that manufacturers comply with fda requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur  post approval or post clearance restrictions or conditions  including post approval or post clearance study commitments  post market surveillance regulations  which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device  and the fda s recall authority  whereby it can ask  or under certain conditions order  device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations 
anti kickback  false claims act  and other laws regarding advertising and promotion in addition to fda s ongoing post approval regulation of drugs  devices  and combination products discussed above  several other types of laws and regulations  subject to differing enforcement regimes  govern advertising and promotion 
in recent years promotional activities of fda regulated products have come under intense scrutiny and have been the subject of enforcement action brought by the department of justice doj  state authorities  and even private individuals 
the federal anti kickback statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for the purchase  lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under medicare  medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs 
this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical or device manufacturers  on the one hand  and prescribers  purchasers  and formulary managers on the other 
violations are punishable by imprisonment  criminal fines  civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs 
any sales or marketing practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing  purchases  or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny under the anti kickback statute 
many states have likewise adopted state anti kickback statutes  and enforcement has been significant 
another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal civil false claims act to impose liability on any person or entity who  among other things  knowingly presents  or causes to be presented  a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program 
if certain conditions are met  the false claims act allows a private individual called a whistleblower to bring a civil action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery 
in recent years  the number or suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically 
in addition  many states have enacted false claim laws similar to the federal false claims act 

table of contents a host of other laws and regulations govern the advertising and promotion of drugs and devices 
the federal sunshine law  which is part of the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act  each enacted in march  imposes federal sunshine provisions  requiring annual reporting of various types of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals 
although implementation of the sunshine provisions was initially delayed by the us centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  a final rule was released in february under the rule  applicable manufacturers must begin tracking relevant transfer of value data in august  and must report data collected between august and the end of to cms by march  cms will publish the data on a public website by september  inaccurate or incomplete reports may be subject to enforcement 
like the federal sunshine law  several states have existing laws that require manufacturers to report transfers of value to select healthcare providers licensed within the state 
additionally  other laws such as the federal lanham act and similar state laws allow competitors and others to initiate litigation relating to advertising claims 
additionally  the us foreign corrupt practices act and local laws of other countries potentially implicate the sale and marketing of drugs and devices internationally 
this complex patchwork of laws can change rapidly with relatively short notice 
surfaxin is our first approved drug product in the us and afectair is our first registered medical device in the us none of our other products under development has been approved for marketing in the us or elsewhere 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any of these products 
if we do not obtain the requisite governmental approvals or if we fail to obtain approvals of the scope we request  we or our licensees or strategic alliance or marketing partners may be delayed or precluded entirely from marketing our products  or the commercial use of our products may be limited 
such events would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see  item a risk factors our technology platform is based solely on our proprietary kl surfactant technology  our novel cag technology  and our novel aerosol conducting airway connectors  our research and development programs for aerosurf and surfaxin ls involve significant risks and uncertainties that are inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  our clinical trials may be delayed  or fail  which will harm our business  we may fail in the development and commercialization of our products  the regulatory approval process for our products is expensive and time consuming and the outcome is uncertain 
we may not obtain required regulatory approvals to commercialize our products  and even if we succeed in gaining regulatory approval to market our drugs  if the fda and foreign regulators later withdraw their approval or otherwise restrict marketing  our business would be materially harmed 
certain of our product candidates may qualify for fast track and or orphan drug designation 
fast track designation means that the fda has determined that the drug is intended to treat a serious or life threatening condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs 
an important feature is that it provides for accelerated approval and the possibility of rolling submissions and emphasizes the critical nature of close  early communication between the fda and sponsor to improve the efficiency of product development 
the fda generally will review an nda for a drug granted fast track designation within six months instead of the typical review cycle that can extend a year or more 
orphan drug designation is granted to pharmaceutical products that are intended to address diseases affecting fewer than  patients in the us and provides certain advantages to the orphan drugs sponsors  including  but not limited to  seven years of market exclusivity upon approval of the drug  certain tax incentives for clinical research and grants to fund testing of the drugs 
see  item a risk factors even though some of our product candidates have qualified for expedited review  the fda may not approve them at all or any sooner than other product candidates that do not qualify for expedited review  and licensing  patents and other proprietary rights and regulatory designations patents and proprietary rights other regulatory designations 
employees as of march   we have employees  of which are full time  two are part time and are employed in connection with our manufacturing operations in totowa  new jersey  subject to a collective bargaining agreement that expires on december  all are employed in the us see  item a risk factors we depend upon key employees and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  it could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products

risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following risks and any of the other information set forth in this annual report on form k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference  before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock 
the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
the following risks  among others  could cause our actual results  performance  achievements or industry results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements contained herein and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business prospects  financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed 
in such case  the market price of our common stock would likely decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
we will require significant additional capital to continue our operations and continue our planned research and development activities 
moreover  such additional financing could result in substantial additional dilution of our stockholders  cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 
we will need substantial additional funding to support our commercial operations and our ongoing research and development activities and our operations 
as of december   we have an accumulated deficit of approximately million and we expect to continue to incur significant  increasing operating losses over the next several years 
to date  we have generated capital to support our activities primarily from equity financings  research grants  collaboration agreements  and investments 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
in february  we entered into an agreement deerfield facility with affiliates of deerfield management company  lp deerfield  pursuant to which deerfield advanced million to us and has agreed to advance an additional million  subject to certain conditions  on or about the date of the first commercial sale of surfaxin  provided that the first sale occurs not later than december  while we believe that we remain on track to effect the first commercial sale of surfaxin in the second quarter of  if for any reason we fail to meet the condition for disbursement of the second deerfield advance  we would forego access to those funds 
also in february  we entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement stifel agreement with stifel  nicolaus company  incorporated stifel  under which stifel  as our exclusive agent  at our discretion and at such times that we determine from time to time  may sell over a three year period up to a maximum of  of shares shares of our common stock 
during the term of the atm program  we are not required to sell any shares at any time 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the atm program  if any  to meet our working capital requirements to execute our business plans  including  without limitation  to support the commercialization in of surfaxin and the afectair device for infants 
there can be no assurance that we will issue any shares pursuant to the atm program 
in addition to potential funding that may be available under the deerfield facility  the atm program  and our committed equity financing facility ceff which is subject to certain conditions and expires on june   we will require significant infusions of capital to fund the anticipated increase in our cash outflows as we continue to invest in our commercial and medical affairs organization and execute the commercial introduction of our approved products  as well as our research and development programs 
the process of achieving hospital formulary acceptance and securing adoption of our approved products is expensive and can be time consuming 
as a result  our investments in commercial and medical affairs activities are expected to outpace the rate at which we generate revenues until such time as our revenues have achieved the anticipated rate over time 
we will require infusions of capital until such time as our revenues from surfaxin and afectair are sufficient to fund our ongoing activities 

table of contents if for any reason  we experience a longer delay in the commercial introduction of surfaxin than currently anticipated  depending upon the length of delay and the underlying cause  we believe that such events could have a material adverse impact on our ability to raise additional capital  whether through use of our atm program or otherwise 
we anticipate that  in a moderate delay  we would likely assess our level of investment in ongoing programs and pace our expenditures to manage and extend the availability of our existing cash resources 
such reductions in investment could cause us to experience delays in the progress of some of our programs and affect the valuations of our business 
however  if the delay were not of a long duration  we believe that our fundamental strategy could remain intact and we would continue to manage our cash resources closely until such time as we have resolved our issues and reinitiated our efforts to effect the commercial introduction of surfaxin 
if any delay were extended for longer periods of time and we are unable to raise additional capital for any reason  we would have to reassess our business strategy and the level of our investments in all categories and would have to consider fundamental changes to our business plans 
if we are unable to successfully raise sufficient additional capital  through future debt and equity financings and or strategic and collaborative arrangements with potential partners  we will likely not have sufficient cash flows and liquidity to fund our business operations as presently contemplated 
in that event  we may be forced to further limit development of many  if not all  of our programs and consider other means of creating value for our stockholders  such as outsourcing certain of our activities and licensing the development and or commercialization of products that we consider valuable and might otherwise plan to develop or commercialize ourselves 
if we are unable to raise the necessary capital  we may be forced to curtail all of our activities and  ultimately  cease operations 
even if we are able to raise additional capital  such financings may only be available on unattractive terms  or could result in significant dilution of stockholders interests and  in such event  the market price of our common stock may decline 
even if we are successful in generating revenues from the sale of approved products in the future  we will likely not have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund our research and development programs and will require additional capital to support these efforts 
we would prefer to accomplish these objectives through strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements 
we are seeking strategic alliances to support the development of aerosurf and  if approved  to commercialize these product candidates in the european union eu and other markets outside the united states us we are also assessing a potential development plan intended to gain marketing authorization for surfaxin ls  a lyophilized dosage form of surfaxin  in the us and potentially other major markets 
if we are unable to successfully raise the necessary additional capital  we will likely not have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund our research and development programs and may be forced to further limit investments in our development programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
even if we are able to raise additional capital  such financings may only be available on unattractive terms  or could result in significant dilution of stockholders interests and  in such event  the market price of our common stock may decline 
see  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
moreover  depending on conditions in the global financial markets  we may face significant challenges accessing the capital markets at a time when we would like or require  and at an increased cost of capital 
except for the potential second disbursement of funds under our deerfield facility  our atm program and our ceff  which has available approximately million shares and expires in june  we currently do not have arrangements to obtain additional financing 
any such financing could be difficult to obtain or only available on unattractive terms and could result in significant dilution of stockholders interests 
in any such event  the market price of our common stock may decline 
in addition  failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business plan  financial performance and stock price and could delay new product development and clinical trial plans 
our near term prospects are highly dependent on the success of surfaxin and afectair 
to the extent we fail to successfully commercialize surfaxin and afectair  or if our efforts to commercialize surfaxin and afectair are significantly delayed  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock would likely decline 
in march  the fda approved surfaxin lucinactant for the prevention of rds in premature infants at high risk for rds 
in february  we successfully registered our afectair device in the united states 
the initial afectair device has been developed for use with infants in the neonatal intensive care unit nicu and smaller infants in the pediatric intensive care unit picu receiving ventilatory support 
we believe that surfaxin and afectair product sales may constitute all or most of our total revenue over the next several years 
in the third quarter of  during a routine review of the results and processes related to the analytical testing and quality control of surfaxin drug product  we determined that one of our analytical chemistry methods used to assess surfaxin drug product conformance to specifications required improvement and that an update to product specifications was needed 
we proactively communicated these findings to the fda  improved and validated the analytical chemistry method  and submitted updated product specifications to the fda 
as a result of these efforts  we delayed the commercial availability of surfaxin drug product 
although there can be no assurances  if we are able to successfully conclude our planned activities and receive confirmation of our updated product specifications from the fda within our anticipated timeline in the second quarter of  we believe that we remain on track to manufacture surfaxin drug product for commercial use in the second quarter of this delay in availability of surfaxin drug product from the fourth quarter to the second quarter of is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position  in part because our commercial launch plans for surfaxin during this period have always been to focus initially on hospital formulary acceptance 
however  if the delay is extended for any reason  failure to timely initiate the commercial introduction of surfaxin could have a material adverse effect on our operations  including our research and development programs  and our financial condition 

table of contents we currently believe that we will successfully execute the commercial introduction of surfaxin within our anticipated timeframe 
however  our efforts are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to be materially different 
the fda may not accept our submission or may require that we develop and submit additional data or other information 
moreover  although the guidelines set forth in the prescription drug user fee act pdufa indicate that the fda will endeavor to respond within four months after the date of our submission  the fda may not respond within that timeframe  or may require additional information that would require additional time and extend the fda s review 
ultimately  the fda may deny our request to consider updated product specifications 
in addition  the fda may determine to initiate a facility inspection to review our manufacturing  quality control and assurance activities and verify the thoroughness of our investigation into the issues identified in our review of the analytical method 
any failure to satisfy any issues raised by the fda  in our submission or in connection with a facilities inspection  could significantly delay  or preclude outright  our gaining fda confirmation of the updated product specifications  or  ultimately  could result in an action by the fda to restrict our ability to commercialize some or all of our products  which could potentially delay or prevent the commercial availability of surfaxin drug product 
in addition  if we successfully make our products commercially available  the commercial success of surfaxin and afectair and our ability to generate and increase revenues will depend on a number of factors  including the following the number of hospitals and critical care centers that agree to place surfaxin drug product on their formulary lists and the length of time required to achieve broad formulary acceptance  the willingness of the target hospitals to accept and employ warming cradle dry block heater  the number of hospitals and critical care centers that agree to include afectair devices on their approved materials list and the degree of use of afectair devices for critical care patients  the effectiveness of our marketing  sales and medical affairs organizations and their ability to a accurately describe surfaxin consistent with its approved labeling  b educate and provide critical care providers and hospitals with medical and scientific education and information concerning our products  and c educate critical care providers and hospitals regarding the potential utility of afectair devices  our ability to gain access to the entire market with our commercial organizations and  if we so determine  through any third party distributor arrangements  the safety and efficacy of surfaxin  our ability to provide hospitals acceptable evidence of the safety and efficacy of surfaxin  and the perceived advantages of surfaxin and afectair over alternative treatment methods  the pharmacoeconomic benefits which are determined by comparing  among other things  the cost and effects of a product when compared to different treatment options and cost effectiveness of our products  the budget impact of adding our products and devices to relevant formulary and medical device hospital lists and the availability  cost and potential advantages of alternative treatments  including less expensive generic drugs and other competitive products  the availability of different size drug vials and medical devices to meet the specific needs of healthcare practitioners  the claims  limitations  warnings and other information that appear in the package insert and labeling of surfaxin drug product  the willingness of third party payers  including government payers  to provide coverage and reimbursements to patients  physicians and other providers who wish to prescribe and use our products  our ability to secure and maintain regulatory marketing approvals from the us and foreign regulatory authorities  the rate of preterm births  the number of infants who are diagnosed with respiratory distress syndrome rds and the number treated with surfaxin  our ability to finalize development of a second afectair device for use with children and adults  the growth of commercial sales  our ability to meet commercial demand for surfaxin and afectair  including through maintenance of commercial supplies of our active drug substances and other excipients  and manufacturing capabilities  by ourselves and through third party manufacturers  and commercial inventory supplies of our medical device products  and 
table of contents the sufficiency of coverage or reimbursement by third parties 
our efforts to achieve formulary acceptance of surfaxin and adoption of afectair  and to educate the medical community and third party payers regarding the benefits of surfaxin and afectair will require significant  focused and competent resources and we may not be successful in achieving our objectives 
surfaxin is approved for marketing only in the us while we plan to register afectair in markets outside the us  beginning with the eu  we cannot predict the extent to which afectair will be utilized in the rest of the world 
we cannot predict whether physicians  healthcare insurers or maintenance organizations  or the medical community in general  will accept or utilize surfaxin  afectair and our other products and devices  if approved 
if we are not successful in our efforts to gain broad acceptance of surfaxin and afectair in our target hospitals  the revenues we generate from sales will be limited and our business may not be profitable 
the commercial success of our product candidates  including surfaxin and afectair  will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians  patients  healthcare payers and others in the medical community 
even if we are successful in achieving our goals for formulary acceptance of surfaxin and adoption of afectair devices  if we do not achieve broad market acceptance of our products by physicians  patients  healthcare payers and others in the medical community  we may not generate sufficient revenues to support continued commercialization of these and our other products  if approved for commercial sale 
the degree of market acceptance of surfaxin and afectair and our product candidates  if approved  will depend on a number of factors  including the willingness of physicians to utilize our products  the degree of acceptance of afectair devices as the standard of care for delivery of inhaled therapies for patients requiring ventilatory support  the safety and efficacy of our products as perceived by the medical community  regulatory agencies and insurers and other payers  on both a short and long term basis  the potential advantages over alternative treatments  the relative convenience and ease of administration  the prevalence and severity of any adverse events  including any unexpected adverse events of which we become aware  and the degree to which the market believes that we are able to manufacture our products and produce supply sufficient to meet market demand 
we may fail in the development and commercialization of our products 
although we have regulatory clearance to market surfaxin and afectair  they are not currently available for sale and we have no other products approved for marketing 
we are implementing a plan intended to result in the commercial introduction of surfaxin in the second quarter of we are initiating a user experience program with our afectair aerosol conducting airway connector for infants in the first half of  to be followed by a national program 
we are also conducting further development activities to introduce a second vial size of surfaxin and  after we have completed introduction of our afectair device for infants  had planned to complete development a second afectair device for use with children and adults 
however  we have decided to delay these development efforts in the near term so that we can focus our resources and expertise on meeting our goals to advance our development program for aerosurf to address rds 
we have and will continue to conduct and sponsor studies evaluating the potential utility of afectair in delivering aerosolized medications and other inhaled therapies  as compared to current standard of care 
we are also conducting research and development on our other product candidates 
as a result  we have not begun to market or generate revenues from the commercialization of any of our products 
we may experience a delay in  or be unable to achieve  the commercial introduction of surfaxin and afectair in the us and other markets as planned  or we may not succeed with our development efforts to manufacture a second vial size of surfaxin or a second afectair device 
we may not successfully develop and market our other kl surfactant and drug device combination and aerosol delivery products 
our long term viability will be impaired if we experience a significant delay or fail to successfully commercialize our approved products or obtain regulatory approval for  and successfully market  our product candidates 
even if we successfully develop and gain regulatory approval for our products  we still may not generate sufficient or sustainable revenues or we may not become profitable  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our marketing and distribution efforts  research and development programs and operations 

table of contents generally  before we can attempt to sell products in a hospital  drug products must be approved for addition to that hospital s list of approved drugs  or formulary list  by the hospital s pharmacy and therapeutics p t committee 
a hospital s p t committee typically governs all matters pertaining to the use of medications within the institution  including the review of medication formulary data and recommendations for the appropriate use of drugs within the institution to the medical staff 
the frequency of p t committee meetings at hospitals varies considerably  and p t committees often require additional information to aid in their decision making process 
therefore  we may experience substantial delays in obtaining formulary approvals 
in addition  our afectair devices must be approved for use by hospitals materials management 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully gain the required hospital approvals for our products 
additionally  hospitals may be concerned that the cost of acquiring our products for use in their institutions will adversely impact their overall budgets  which could cause resistance to efforts to add our drugs to the formulary and products to the materials list  or to implement restrictions on the usage of our drugs and products in order to control costs 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the approvals we need from enough hospitals quickly enough to optimize hospital sales of surfaxin  afectair or our other products  if approved 
in order to facilitate proper preparation and administration of surfaxin  we plan to make available to hospitals warming cradle dry block heating devices that are designed to warm drug vials at the same temperature and for the time period that is designated in the surfaxin prescribing information 
we will need to arrange with each hospital to include warming cradle dry block heating devices on the hospital s list of approved laboratory equipment 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in gaining such approvals 
we may commit substantial efforts  funds and other resources to developing commercially successful products 
a high rate of failure  or costly delay  is inherent in the development of new medical products 
currently  we are in the process of developing a second vial size for surfaxin as well as additional designs of afectair devices 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to develop these products will be successful or that these products will be commercially viable 
failure can occur at any point in the development process  including after significant funds have been invested 
promising new product candidates may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns  failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes  inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals  failure to achieve market adoption  limited scope of approved uses  excessive costs to manufacture  the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights  or the infringement of intellectual property rights of others 
even if we successfully develop new products or enhancements or new generations of our existing products  they may be quickly rendered obsolete by newer products  changing customer preferences or changing industry standards 
innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of  among other things  entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third party reimbursement 
we cannot state with certainty when or whether any of our products under development will be launched  whether we will be able to develop  license or otherwise acquire products  or whether any products will be commercially successful 
failure to launch successful new products or new indications for existing products may cause our products to become obsolete 
to support the commercialization of surfaxin in markets outside the us  we plan to rely on one or more strategic alliances to support the development and  if approved  distribution and commercialization of our kl surfactant products and afectair devices 
we may enter into distributor arrangements to manage the commercial introduction of afectair devices in markets outside the us if we enter into distributor arrangements or strategic alliances  we may be required to transfer rights to our products and will be exposed to risks associated with the transfer of control to third parties 
to support the commercial introduction of surfaxin and afectair in the us  we plan to rely on our own commercial and medical affairs organization 
however  in markets outside the us  we plan to seek one or more strategic alliances and or collaboration arrangements potentially to share research and development expenses for our kl surfactant development programs  and  if approved  to support the commercial introduction of these products in the europe union and elsewhere 
we may also seek strategic alliances and or collaboration arrangements to support the potential commercial introduction of surfaxin and  if approved  surfaxin ls  in countries where regulatory marketing authorization is facilitated by the recent approval of surfaxin by the fda 

table of contents if we succeed in entering into one or more strategic alliances  our ability to execute our operating plan will depend upon numerous factors  including  the performance of the strategic partners and collaborators with whom we may contract 
under these arrangements  our partners may control key decisions relating to the development  and assuming approval  commercialization  of our products 
such rights of our partners would limit our flexibility in considering development strategies and in commercializing our products 
in addition  if we breach or terminate our strategic alliance agreements or if our strategic partners otherwise fail to conduct their activities in a timely manner  or if there is a dispute about our respective obligations  we may need to seek other partners or  in the alternative and after a potentially unacceptable delay  develop our own internal sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize our products in the us if we fail to successfully develop these relationships  or if we or our partners fail to successfully develop or commercialize any of our products  it may delay or prevent us from developing or commercializing our products in a competitive and timely manner and would have a material adverse effect on the commercialization of our products 
for example  our collaboration arrangement with esteve for surfaxin and certain other of our drug product candidates is focused on andorra  greece  italy  portugal and spain 
we have limited influence over the decisions made by esteve or its sublicensees or the resources that they may devote to the marketing and distribution of our kl surfactant products in their licensed territory  and esteve or its sublicensees may not meet their obligations in this regard 
our marketing and distribution arrangement with esteve may not be successful  and  as a result  we may not receive any revenues from it 
in addition  we may not be able to enter into marketing and sales agreements for our kl surfactant pipeline products on acceptable terms  if at all  in territories not covered by the esteve agreement  or for any of our other drug product candidates 
if esteve or we should fail to conduct our respective collaboration related activities in a timely manner  or otherwise breach or terminate the agreements that make up our collaboration arrangements  or if a dispute should arise under our collaboration arrangements  such events could impair our ability to commercialize or develop our products for the esteve territory in europe 
in that event  we may need to seek other partners and collaboration arrangement  or we may have to develop our own internal capabilities to market the covered products in the esteve territory without a collaboration arrangement 
our plan to use strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements to leverage our capabilities may not be successful if we are unable to integrate our partners capabilities with our operations or if our partners capabilities do not meet our expectations 
as part of our strategy  we intend to continue to evaluate strategic partnership opportunities and collaboration arrangements 
in order for these efforts to be successful  we must first identify partners whose capabilities complement and integrate well with ours 
technologies to which we gain access may prove ineffective or unsafe 
ownership of these technologies may be disputed 
the agreements that grant us access to such technologies may expire and may not be renewable or could be terminated if our partners or we do not meet our respective obligations 
in addition  our partners may provide certain services for us  such as product development support or distribution services 
these agreements may be subject to differing interpretations and we and our partners may not agree on the appropriate interpretation or specific requirements 
among other things  our partners may prove difficult to work with  less effective than we originally expected or unable to satisfy their financial and other commitments to us 
failure of our partners to perform as needed could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
if one of our strategic partners or collaborators pursues a product that competes with our products  there could be a conflict of interest and we may not receive expected revenues or milestone or royalty payments 
certain of our potential strategic partners and collaborators may be developing or marketing a variety of products  some with other partners 
partners or collaborators with whom we enter into distribution agreements may sell and market products that compete with ours  or they may seek to develop  market or sell existing or alternative products or technologies or products targeted at the same diseases or conditions as the products that are the subject of an arrangement with us 
our strategic partners and collaborators may also develop products that are similar to or compete with products they are developing in collaboration with us 
if these entities pursue other products instead of our products  we may not receive the anticipated revenues or milestone or royalty payments  or our efforts to distribute our products may be adversely affected 

table of contents we currently have limited experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and limited marketing capabilities  which may restrict our success in commercializing our product candidates 
we have developed our own commercial and medical affairs organizations to launch our drug products in the us while we believe that this strategy greatly improves our ability to introduce our products in the us  it may also increase the cost to commercialize our products 
we also plan to use our marketing  sales and medical affairs organizations to executive the commercial introduction of our afectair device for infants 
we plan to consider strategic alliances and third party distribution arrangements to support the commercialization of afectair in markets outside the us  which could require us to give up rights to our products 
we have limited experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products  although we have endeavored to hire individuals that individually have significant experience in neonatal indications and or hospital based products 
we plan primarily to rely on our own specialty respiratory critical care commercial and medical affairs organizations to market and support surfaxin  and  if approved  aerosurf and surfaxin ls in the us we expect that our commercial organization will also support the commercial introduction of our afectair device 
commercializing our drug product candidates in the us on our own will likely cause our commercialization costs to increase  but will potentially avoid the transfer of rights to our products or drug product candidates and thereby potentially increase the revenue opportunity 
building our own commercial and medical affairs capabilities is potentially a difficult  expensive and time consuming process and requires a substantial capital investment 
recruiting  training and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success 
competition for such personnel can be intense  and we may be unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals to successfully support the launch and continued distribution of our products 
we also may be unable to provide competitive incentives to retain our sales force 
if we are unable to successfully attract  motivate and retain our commercial and medical affairs organizations to support the introduction and sale of our products  we will have difficulty selling  maintaining and increasing the sales of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we also plan to rely on our own commercial and medical affairs organizations to introduce the afectair device for infants in the us we believe that this afectair device will be of interest to many of the same hospitals  neonatologists and neonatal intensive care units that purchase surfaxin 
we plan to review and re assess this strategy at the time that we introduce additional afectair devices in the future 
even with our own commercial and medical affairs organizations to support the launch of surfaxin and the afectair device for infants in the us  we may also need to enter into co marketing arrangements with third parties where our own personnel are neither well situated nor numerous enough to achieve maximum penetration in the market 
in addition  we may seek strategic alliances and or collaboration arrangements to support the potential commercial introduction of surfaxin and  if approved  surfaxin ls in countries where regulatory marketing authorization is facilitated by the information contained in the surfaxin new drug application nda approved by the fda 
we also plan to consider strategic alliances and or collaboration arrangements  including third party distributors or marketing alliances to sell  our afectair devices in international markets 
we may not be successful in entering into any such arrangements  and the terms of any such arrangements may not be favorable to us 
in addition  if we enter into co marketing arrangements to market and sell additional products directly  we may need to further expand our commercial staff and incur additional expense 
we may not be successful in identifying strategic alliances and or collaboration arrangements  third party distributorships or marketing alliances or finalizing such arrangements on terms and conditions that are favorable to us and  as a result  we may not be able to commercialize our products on a timely basis 
if we are not successful in finalizing such arrangements  we may not have sufficient funds to successfully commercialize surfaxin and afectair or any other potential product  in the us or elsewhere 
if we enter into alliances and distribution arrangements to commercialize our products  such arrangements will subject us to a number of risks  including our distributors or collaborators may require that we transfer to them important rights to our products and or product candidates  
table of contents we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our distributors or collaborators devote to the commercialization of our products  if our distributors or collaborators fail to perform their obligations under our arrangements to our satisfaction  we may not achieve our projected sales and our revenues would suffer 
we also may incur additional expense to terminate such arrangements and to identify and enter into arrangements with replacement distributors or collaborators  our distributors or collaborators may experience financial difficulties  and business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator s willingness or ability to perform its obligations under any arrangement  which would adversely affect our business 
if we fail to enter into arrangements with third parties in a timely manner or if such parties fail to perform  it could adversely affect sales of our products 
we and our third party distributors and collaborators must also market our products in compliance with federal  state and local laws related to providing incentives and inducements 
violation of these laws can result in substantial penalties 
if we fail to maintain our commercial and medical affairs capabilities or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties in a timely manner or if such third parties fail to perform  it could adversely affect sales of our products 
in addition  even if we establish or secure such capabilities  our third party distributors and we must also market our products in compliance with federal  state and local laws relating to the restrictions on incentives and inducements 
violation of these laws can result in substantial penalties 
if we are unable to successfully motivate our sales force  or if our distributors fail to promote our products  we will have difficulty maintaining and increasing the sales of our products 
we may have difficulty managing our growth 
we have experienced significant growth in the scope of our operations as we prepare for the anticipated launch of our products in the us  and thereafter  through strategic partnerships or distributorships  in the eu and in selected markets outside the us as this potential growth occurs  it has and will continue to place additional significant demands on our management and our financial and operational resources  and will require that we continue to develop and improve our operational  financial and other internal controls 
we also are engaged in discussions with potential strategic partners  which  if successful  will require additional management resources and controls to implement and potentially add a layer of complexity to our operations 
we plan at various stages of development to distribute our products in the us and potentially the eu and other major markets  through potential strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements 
this expansion could further increase the challenges involved in implementing appropriate operational and financial systems  expanding manufacturing and production capacity  expanding our marketing and sales infrastructure and capabilities  and providing adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards 
we believe that the significant challenges associated with our potential growth will include our ability to recruit  train and integrate skilled marketing  sales  medical affairs  supply chain  administrative and management personnel  to establish strategic partnerships and collaboration arrangements to support our development and commercialization activities  and to provide for manufacturing  including analytical testing and distribution capabilities  for our products  and clinical capabilities for our products under development 
our inability to grow our business appropriately or otherwise adapt to growth would cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
we are continually evaluating our business strategy and may modify this strategy in light of developments in our business and other factors 
as we proceed with our plans to commercialize surfaxin and afectair in markets both inside and outside the us  we will continually evaluate our commercial strategy and will modify our plans as necessary to achieve our objectives 
the activities associated with introduction of a new product are complex  involve many persons and entities  including third parties that we may not be able to control  and require the coordination of a number of elements  any one of which could involve unforeseen events or circumstances that require adjustment or the development of alternative strategies 
if we encounter such events or circumstances  we will change our strategy and plans if we believe that such a change will be in our best interest 
for example  if we experience any significant delay in our efforts to commercialize our products  we may adjust our approach to take into account any potential impact such a delay may have on our ability to fund our activities  or  if we were to determine that an alternative approach or structure would allow us to maintain control of our products or improve the profitability of our products in one or more markets  we will consider adopting such other approaches 
similarly  if a potential partner were to make observations or recommendations concerning the focus  sequence or approach of any or all of our research and development programs  we may consider taking such observations or recommendations into account in our planning process and activities 
there can be no assurance  whether or not we alter our strategy or plans for any reason  that we will be successful  or that our product launches will be effectively executed on time  if at all  in all markets that we may identify 

table of contents our ability to discover and develop new products depends on our internal research capabilities and our ability to acquire products 
although we continue to conduct research and development activities on products and have increased our activities in this area  our limited resources may not be sufficient to discover and develop new product candidates 
to assist us with the development of our products and  if approved  commercialization of our products in markets outside the us  we continue to evaluate potential strategic partnership and collaboration arrangements 
however  there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that  even if we identify and enter into any such strategic partnership or collaboration arrangement  that such transactions will be successfully implemented within our expected time frames 
we continue to evaluate our business strategy and  as a result  may modify our strategy in the future 
with respect to our research and development activities  to respond to changing circumstances  we may  from time to time  refocus our product development efforts on different products or may pace  delay or halt the development of various products 
as a result of changes in our strategy  we may also change or refocus our existing drug discovery  development  commercialization and manufacturing activities 
this could require changes in our facilities and personnel and restructuring various financial arrangements 
there can be no assurances that any product development or other changes that we implement will be successful or that  after implementation of any such changes  that we will not refocus our efforts on new or different objectives 
if our business development activities are unsuccessful  our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected 
as part of our long term growth strategy  we engage in business development activities intended to develop strategic opportunities  including potential strategic alliances  joint development opportunities  acquisitions  technology licensing arrangements and other similar opportunities 
such opportunities may result in substantial investments 
our success in developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to find suitable opportunities for investment  alliance or acquisition  whether we are able to complete an investment  alliance or acquisition on terms that are satisfactory to us  the strength of our underlying technology  products and our ability to execute our business strategies  any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology  and our ability to successfully execute the investment  alliance or acquisition into our existing operations  including to fund our share of any in process research and development projects 
if we are unsuccessful in our business development activities  we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected 
our existing and future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition  and in the event we are unable to meet our debt obligations  the lenders could foreclose on our assets 
in connection with a facility agreement entered into on february   deerfield has agreed to advance to us  subject to certain conditions  up to  principal amount of long term debt 
our debt obligations could impair our liquidity  could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations  require us to dedicate cash flow to payments on our debt obligations  which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other corporate requirements  impose restrictions on our ability to incur other indebtedness  grant liens on our assets  other than permitted indebtedness and permitted liens  and could impede us from obtaining additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes  
table of contents impose restrictions on us with respect to the use of our available cash  including in connection with future acquisitions  could adversely affect our ability to enter into strategic transactions and similar agreements  or require us to obtain the consent of our lenders  make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business prospects and could limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our licensing markets  and could place us at a competitive disadvantage when compared to our competitors who are not similarly restricted 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure our obligations under the facility agreement 
in the event that we were to fail in the future to make any required payment under the facility agreement or fail to comply with the covenants contained in the facility agreement and other related agreements  we would be in default regarding that indebtedness 
a debt default would enable the lenders to foreclose on the assets securing such debt and could significantly diminish the market value and marketability of our common stock and could result in the acceleration of the payment obligations under all or a portion of our consolidated indebtedness 
even after completing our deerfield facility  we will need to obtain additional capital to successfully commercialize our approved products and develop our products under development  including aerosurf and surfaxin ls  and continue our other research and development programs 
our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception 
we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to execute our business plans  including to effect the commercial introduction of surfaxin and afectair  execute our development plans for aerosurf and our lyophilized kl surfactant surfaxin ls  including our planned clinical trials  and continue our research and development programs to advance our product pipeline in the future 
at the present time  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  including net proceeds from the initial disbursement under the deerfield facility  will be sufficient to fund our operations through the third quarter of we will need to raise additional funds to continue our operations 
see  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly delay  scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our products or our research and development programs 
we also could be required to seek collaborators for one or more of our development programs for territories that we had planned to retain or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available  or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
we plan to seek additional sources of non dilutive financing  including potentially a capital financing facility  to fund a portion of our expenses 
however  such facilities may not be available  if at all  on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 
if we are unable to secure such financing  we may seek additional capital from the public markets  which could have a dilutive impact on our stockholders and the issuance  or even potential issuance  of shares could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
manufacturing problems potentially could cause us to delay preclinical or clinical programs  or  if our products are approved  product launch  or cause us to experience shortages of product inventories  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and compliance with strictly enforced federal  state and foreign regulations 
we  our contract manufacturing organizations cmos or our materials and drug substances suppliers may experience manufacturing or quality control and assurance problems that could result in a failure to maintain compliance with cgmp and quality requirements  or those of foreign regulators  which is necessary to continue manufacturing of our drug products  materials or drug substances 
other problems that may be encountered include 
table of contents the need to make necessary modifications to qualify and validate a facility  difficulties with production and yields  including manufacturing and completing all required release testing on a timely basis to meet demand  difficulties with production and yields  including manufacturing and completing all required release testing on a timely basis to meet demand  quality control and assurance problems related to  among other things  the release and stability testing of our drug product  or materials and drug substances  casualty damage to a facility  and shortages of qualified personnel 
such a failure could result in product production and shipment delays or an inability to obtain materials or drug substance supplies 
we have recently executed a plan to upgrade and validate one of our analytical chemistry methods used to assess drug product conformance to specifications of surfaxin drug product and to update related product specifications and have submitted updated product specifications to the fda 
as a result of this effort  the commercial introduction of surfaxin has been delayed until the second quarter of manufacturing or quality control problems have occurred in the past and may again occur at our manufacturing and quality facilities or at the facilities of a cmo of our drug substances and materials suppliers 
such problems may in the particular circumstance require potentially complex  time consuming and costly comprehensive investigations to determine the root causes of such problems and may require detailed and time consuming remediation efforts  which can further delay a return to normal manufacturing and production activities 
any failure by our own manufacturing operations or by the manufacturing operations of any of our suppliers to comply with cgmp requirements or other fda or similar foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our drug products  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize surfaxin and potentially adversely affect our clinical research activities 
we currently do not have a back up facility 
any interruption of our manufacturing operations at totowa  new jersey  could result in a shortage of our commercial drug supply of surfaxin and could affect our commercial supply and potentially our preclinical and clinical development activities 
a number of factors could cause interruptions  including equipment malfunctions or failures  technology malfunctions  work stoppages or slowdowns  damage to or destruction of the facility  regional power shortages  and product tampering 
in connection with our manufacturing activities  we own certain specialized manufacturing equipment  employ experienced manufacturing senior executive and managerial personnel  and continue to invest in enhanced quality systems and manufacturing capabilities 
however  we do not have fully redundant systems and equipment to respond promptly in the event of a significant loss at our manufacturing operations 
under certain conditions  we may be unable to produce surfaxin at the required volumes or to appropriate standards  if at all 
if we are unable to successfully maintain our manufacturing capabilities and at all times comply with cgmp  it will adversely affect our efforts to commercialize surfaxin and have an adverse effect on our sales 
if the parties we depend on for supplying our active drug substances  materials and excipients as well as manufacturing related services do not timely supply these products and services  it may delay or impair our ability to manufacture and market our approved products and execute our development plans for our pipeline products 
such delays could adversely impact our operations and financial performance 
we rely on suppliers for our active drug substances  materials and excipients  and third parties for certain manufacturing related services to manufacture drug product that meets appropriate content  quality and stability standards for use in preclinical programs and clinical trials and  for our approved products  commercial sales 
our ability to manufacture depends upon receiving adequate supplies and related services  which may be difficult or uneconomical to procure 
supply chain or manufacturing interruptions could negatively impact our operations and financial performance 
the supply of any of our manufacturing materials may be interrupted because of supply shortages  poor vendor performance or other events outside our control  which may require us  among other things  to identify alternate vendors  which could involve a lengthy process  and result in lost sales and increased expenses 

table of contents in some cases  we are dependent upon a single supplier to provide all of our requirements for one or more of our drug substances  materials and excipients or one or more of our drug product device subcomponents  components and subassemblies 
to assure compliance with cgmp requirements  we have entered into quality agreements with all of our suppliers of active drug substances and related materials 
however  we have a requirements contract relating to continued access to active drug substances with only one provider of our drug substances 
if we do not maintain manufacturing and service relationships that are important to us and are not able to identify a replacement supplier or vendor or develop our own manufacturing capabilities  our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products could be impaired or delayed and our costs could substantially increase 
even if we are able to find replacement manufacturers  suppliers and vendors when needed  we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us or there could be a substantial delay before such manufacturer  vendor or supplier  or a related new facility is properly qualified and registered with the fda or other foreign regulatory authorities 
the process of changing a supplier could have an adverse impact on future growth opportunities during the transition period if supplies of drug substances  materials or excipients on hand are insufficient to satisfy demand 
such delays could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and our business 
a catastrophic event at our warrington  pennsylvania or totowa  new jersey facilities or any of the facilities used by our third party manufacturers would prevent us from producing many of our drug products candidates and or medical devices 
our facilities consist of our headquarters in warrington  pennsylvania and our manufacturing facility in totowa  new jersey 
we maintain our analytical testing and device development laboratories in warrington  pennsylvania 
our facility in new jersey is specifically designed for the aseptic manufacture and filling of sterile pharmaceuticals in compliance with cgmp and is our only drug manufacturing facility 
while we manufacture our surfaxin liquid instillate at our facilities in totowa  we depend upon third party manufacturers to manufacture warming cradle dry block heaters  our lyophilized kl surfactant  our afectair devices and our cag 
all of these products are or will be manufactured at a single facility 
if a catastrophic event occurred at any our facilities or the facilities of any of our third party manufacturers  such as a fire  flood or tornado  many of those products could not be produced until the manufacturing portion of such facility was restored and cleared by the fda 
with respect to our totowa facility  we maintain a disaster plan to minimize the effects of such a catastrophe  and we have obtained insurance to protect against certain business interruption losses 
however  there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms  if at all 
relying exclusively on third parties to manufacture certain of our drug product candidates and medical devices exposes us to risks that may delay our research and development activities  regulatory approval and commercialization of our drug product candidates 
while we manufacture our surfaxin liquid instillate at our facilities in totowa  new jersey  we plan to depend upon third party manufacturers to manufacture our lyophilized dosage form of our kl surfactant  afectair devices and our cag 
our planned future reliance on third party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks we may be unable to identify manufacturers with whom we might establish appropriate arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all  because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the fda must approve any replacement contractor 
this approval would require new testing and compliance inspections as well as a potentially lengthy qualification process 
in addition  a new manufacturer would have to be educated in  or develop substantially equivalent processes for  production of our approved products after receipt of fda approval  third party manufacturers might be unable to manufacture our products in the volume and to our specifications to meet our clinical needs and  if approved  commercial needs  or we may have difficulty scheduling the production of product batches in a timely manner to meet our timing requirements  
table of contents cmos may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce  store and distribute our products  cmos are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the fda  the drug enforcement administration  and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cgmp and or quality system regulations qsr and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
we do not have control over third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards  if any third party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products  we may not own  or may have to share  the intellectual property rights to any such innovation 
we may be required to pay fees or other costs for access to such improvements  and each of these risks could delay our development programs  the approval  if any  of our product candidates by the fda or the commercialization of our product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues 
for the development and  if approved  commercialization of aerosurf  we will depend in large measure upon the manufacturers and assemblers of our cag devices 
if we are unable to identify qualified manufacturers and assemblers  the timeline of our plans for the development and  if approved  commercialization of aerosurf and any other aerosolized kl surfactant products  could suffer 
we are exposed to similar risks with respect to the manufacture of our afectair devices 
in connection with the development of aerosurf  which is a drug device combination product that produces our aerosolized kl surfactant  we plan to rely on cmos to manufacture and assemble the subcomponents of our cag technology to support our preclinical experiments  planned clinical studies and  if approved  commercial device 
certain of these components must be manufactured in an environmentally controlled area and  when assembled  the critical drug product contact components must be packaged and sterilized 
each of the aerosolization system devices must pass quality control testing prior to release and monitored for conformance to designated product specification 
we have worked with selected component manufacturers to develop our initial prototype cag device 
we are currently working with battelle to develop an optimized cag device to meet regulatory and ease of use design requirements for aerosurf and prepare a clinic ready device for our planned phase clinical trials 
as with many device development initiatives  there is a risk that  even if we are able to finalize specifications for the cag  the manufacturers that we identify may not be able to consistently manufacture and assemble  if at all  the subcomponents of our cag systems to our specified standards 
in addition  we may not be able to identify qualified additional or replacement manufacturers and assemblers to manufacture subcomponents and assemble our optimized cag system and  if developed  later versions of our cag systems  or we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable and acceptable to us 
in addition  the manufacturers and assemblers that we identify may be unable to timely comply with fda  or other foreign regulatory agency  regulatory manufacturing requirements 
if we do not successfully identify and enter into contractual agreements with manufacturers and assemblers that have the required expertise to produce our cag devices as and when needed  it will adversely affect our timeline for the development and  if approved  commercialization of our aerosolized kl surfactant  including aerosurf 
our relationship with lacey exposes us to similar risks in the manufacture of our afectair device for infants 
we are reliant upon lacey for  among other things  the manufacture  packaging and labeling of our afectair devices 
these activities must be performed to specifications and in compliance with the regulations of the fda and foreign regulators 
in the event of any release of defective product  lacey is obligated to cooperate with us  including for those defects that result in product recalls or other similar events 
if lacey is unable to manufacture to our specifications  or if lacey fails to comply with the regulations of the fda or foreign regulators  it could have a material adverse effect on our development and commercial activities and our financial condition and prospects 
the cost of materials required for the manufacture of afectair may increase or be higher than anticipated 
the components of afectair are manufactured from high quality medical grade materials that are generally recognized as safe 
suppliers of these materials  due to a change in their pricing policies or an increase in raw materials costs  might charge us increasingly higher than anticipated prices 
in turn  we might experience diminishing profit margins or remain unprofitable indefinitely 

table of contents issues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business  subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation and cause a loss of customer confidence in our products or us 
our success depends upon the quality of our products 
our future revenues will depend upon our ability to develop  maintain  and continuously improve our quality management system  including an objective and systematic process for monitoring and the evaluation of key process indicators 
quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products 
we are dependent upon third party suppliers  manufacturers and service providers to support our development and commercialization activities 
third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards 
failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays or other quality related issues 
a quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and may result in warning letters  product recalls or seizures  monetary sanctions  injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products  civil or criminal sanctions  refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses  restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses 
an inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity  a loss of customer confidence in our current or future products or us  which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in commercializing our products 
afectair device product inadequacies could lead to recalls and harm our reputation  business and financial results 
the design  manufacture and marketing of our medical device products involve certain inherent risks 
our products must be designed  manufactured and marketed to specific product specifications 
manufacturing or design defects  unanticipated use of our products  or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events 
personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us 
in some circumstances  such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 
we also may be restricted or prohibited from marketing or manufacturing a product  even after obtaining marketing authorization  if previously unknown problems with the product or its manufacture are subsequently discovered and we cannot provide assurance that newly discovered or developed safety issues will not arise following any regulatory clearance 
the fda and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
in the case of the fda  the authority to require a mandatory recall must be based on an fda finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death 
in addition  foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
manufacturers may  under their own initiative  initiate a field alert or action  known as a recall  for a product if any material deficiency in a device is found 
a government mandated or voluntary recall by us or our third party manufacturers or suppliers could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors  design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues 
recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the fda requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the fda within working days after the recall is initiated 
we are required to maintain certain records of recalls  even if they are not reportable to the fda 
we may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification to the fda 
if the fda disagrees with our determinations  they could require us to report those actions as recalls 
a future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales 
in addition  the fda could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted 
under the fda medical device reporting regulation  medical device manufacturers are required to report to the fda information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur 
if we fail to report these events to the fda within the required timeframes  or at all  the fda could take enforcement action against us 
any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions  such as recalls or customer notifications  or agency action  such as inspection or enforcement action 
any corrective action  whether voluntary or involuntary  as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit  will require the dedication of our time and capital  distract management from operating our business  and may harm our reputation and financial results 

table of contents marketing authorization to promote  manufacture and or sell afectair will be limited and subject to continuing review 
similar risks arise with our surfaxin drug product 
we have successfully registered our afectair device in the us we also expect to register this device in the eu 
these registrations do not include substantial claims with respect to potential use or efficacy 
even if regulatory clearance of this product is granted in the eu  such clearance will be subject to limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed and reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product 
similarly  although our label for surfaxin contains more information  including data from our pivotal phase clinical trial  there are limitations that affect the manner in which we may market and sell our surfaxin drug product 
the fda and other regulatory agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting promotion of off label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance has not been obtained 
if the fda were to determine that our promotional materials  labeling  training or other marketing or educational activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use  it could direct us to cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to serious regulatory enforcement actions 
it is also possible that other federal  state or foreign enforcement authorities could take action if they consider our training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities  such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement 
a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability  including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions 
due to these legal constraints  our marketing and sales efforts will have to focus on the general technical attributes and benefits of afectair and any fda cleared indications for use 
we have conducted a series of studies  and plan to conduct further studies  evaluating the utility of afectair in delivering specific inhaled therapies  but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful  or even if successful  that we will be able to expand our label to include the additional indications 
for surfaxin  our marketing and sales efforts will have to be based on our label  although there is other data and information available that speaks to the benefits of our kl surfactants 
in addition  for both our afectair device and surfaxin  we will have to comply with reporting requirements applicable to medical devices and drug products  including the reporting of adverse events and device malfunctions related to our products 
later discovery of previously unknown problems  including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  manufacturing problems or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in changes to labeling  restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of the products from the market or regulatory enforcement actions 
our activities are subject to various and complex laws and regulations  and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment 
any failure to comply could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products and our operations are regulated by numerous government agencies  both inside and outside the us our drug product candidates and medical devices must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive  costly and time consuming procedures mandated by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities 
our facilities and those of our third party providers must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection at any time thereafter 
failure to comply with the requirements of the fda or other regulatory authorities  including a failed inspection or a failure in our post marketing reporting  could result in warning letters  product recalls or seizures  monetary sanctions  injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of our products  civil or criminal sanctions  refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses  restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses 
any of these actions could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our sales 
in addition  requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities may change and implementing any additional compliance requirements may increase our costs  or force us or our third party providers to suspend production  which could result in a shortage of our approved product or delays in the commercial introduction of our new product candidates  if approved 

table of contents with the commercial launch of surfaxin and afectair  we will be required to comply with not only the requirements of the fda and international regulators  but will also become subject to various federal  state and international laws regulating the sales  marketing  and distribution of healthcare related products 
these laws govern such activities as our relationships with healthcare providers  the promotion of our products  and pricing of prescription drug products and medical devices 
the sales and marketing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increasing scrutiny by federal  state and foreign government agencies 
the fda and other federal regulators have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the anti kickback statute  false claims act  off label promotion of products  and other healthcare related laws  antitrust and other competition laws 
the department of justice doj also has increased its focus on the enforcement of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies 
foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers 
of particular importance  federal and state anti kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit  offer  receive  or pay any remuneration in exchange for  or to induce  the referral of business  including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug 
these laws can be complicated  are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly 
in addition  the absence of guidance for some of these laws and the very few court decisions addressing industry practices increase the likelihood that our practices could be challenged under anti kickback or similar laws 
false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting  or causing to be presented  for payment to the government including medicare and medicaid claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent  claims for items or services not provided as claimed  or claims for medically unnecessary items or services 
in addition  a number of states require that companies implement compliance programs or comply with industry ethics codes  adopt spending limits  and report to state governments any gifts  compensation  and other remuneration provided to physicians 
many pharmaceutical  device  and other health care companies have been investigated and prosecuted for alleged violations of these laws 
sanctions under these laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer products from reimbursement under government programs including medicare and medicaid  criminal fines  and imprisonment 
companies that have chosen to settle these alleged violations have typically paid multi million dollar fines to the government and agreed to abide by corporate integrity agreements  which often include significant and costly burdens 
under the federal false claims act and related state laws  private individuals may bring similar actions 
in addition  an increasing number of state laws require manufacturers to report to the state certain pricing and marketing information 
many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws 
given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation  our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the state authorities 
we are refining our comprehensive compliance program  including policies  training and various forms of monitoring  designed to address the sales and marketing related risks set forth above 
however  no compliance program can mitigate risk in its entirety 
violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties  debarment from participating in government programs  diversion of management time  attention and resources and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the regulatory approval process for our products is expensive and time consuming and the outcome is uncertain 
we may not obtain required regulatory approvals to commercialize our products 
to test  make and sell our products under development  we must receive regulatory approvals for each product 
the fda and foreign regulators  such as the european medicines agency ema  extensively and rigorously regulate the testing  manufacture  distribution  advertising  pricing and marketing of drug products 
this approval process includes i preclinical studies and clinical trials of each drug product candidate and active pharmaceutical ingredient to establish its safety and effectiveness  and ii confirmation by the fda and foreign regulators that we maintain good laboratory and manufacturing practices during testing and manufacturing 
even if favorable data are generated by clinical trials  the fda or foreign regulator may not accept or approve an nda or market authorization application maa filed for a drug product on a timely basis or at all 
see  item business government regulation in this form k 
we are currently planning to initiate a phase clinical program for aerosurf in the fourth quarter of we believe that our success in gaining approval for surfaxin in the us may facilitate our efforts to gain regulatory approval for aerosurf and surfaxin ls in the us and potentially other major markets 
however  there can be no assurance that issues requiring protracted and time consuming preclinical studies will not arise or that our clinical programs will be concluded successfully 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in gaining regulatory approval for aerosurf or surfaxin ls  if at all  within our expected time frame 

table of contents we plan to pursue clinical development in the us and potentially in the eu and other markets  and  if approved  market and sell our products in the us and potentially in the eu and other major markets 
to accomplish this objective  we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and comply with regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction 
to avoid the significant expense and lengthy time required to complete multiple clinical programs  we expect to meet with the fda and other regulatory authorities to potentially address the requirements of the various regulatory authorities through a single  global clinical program 
there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful 
if we are unable to reach agreement with the various regulatory authorities  we may not be able to pursue regulatory approval of our products in all of our selected markets 
the approval procedures vary among countries in complexity and timing 
we may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the us on a timely basis  if at all  which would preclude us from commercializing products in those markets 
in addition  some countries  particularly the countries of the eu  regulate the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals 
in these countries  pricing discussions with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product 
to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries  we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of their product candidate to other available therapies 
such trials may be time consuming and expensive  and may not show an advantage in efficacy for our products 
if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount  or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels  in either the us or the eu  we could be adversely affected 
even though some of our product candidates have qualified for expedited review  the fda may not approve them at all or any sooner than other product candidates that do not qualify for expedited review 
the fda has notified us that two indications of our kl surfactant technology pipeline  bpd in premature infants and ards in adults  have been granted designation as fast track products under provisions of the food and drug administration modernization act of we believe that other potential products in our kl surfactant technology pipeline may also qualify for fast track designation 
fast track designation does not accelerate clinical trials nor does it mean that the regulatory requirements are less stringent 
our products may cease to qualify for expedited review and our other product candidates may fail to qualify for fast track designation or expedited review 
moreover  even if we are successful in gaining fast track designation  other factors could result in significant delays in our development activities with respect to our fast track products 
even if we succeed in gaining regulatory approval to market our drugs  if the fda and foreign regulators later withdraw their approval or otherwise restrict marketing  our business would be materially harmed 
the fda has approved surfaxin for marketing in the us our development programs for aerosurf and surfaxin ls are in the preclinical stage  with phase clinical trials for aerosurf anticipated in the fourth quarter of foreign regulators have not yet approved surfaxin or any of our products under development 
without regulatory approval  we will not be able to market these products 
even if we were to succeed in gaining regulatory approvals for any of our products  the fda or a foreign regulator could at any time withdraw any approvals granted if there is a later discovery of previously unidentified problems or if we fail to comply with other applicable regulatory requirements at any stage in the regulatory process  or the fda or a foreign regulator may restrict or delay our marketing of a product  including by requiring us to include warnings and other restrictions in the package inserts for our products  or force us to make product recalls 
in addition  the fda could impose other sanctions such as fines  injunctions  civil penalties or criminal prosecutions 
any withdrawal of our regulatory approval or significant restriction on our ability to market our products after approval would have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our research and development programs for aerosurf and surfaxin ls involve significant risks and uncertainties that are inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes 
development risk factors include  but are not limited to  whether we  or our third party collaborators  drug substances and materials suppliers and cmos  will be able to complete our preclinical and clinical trials of our kl surfactant product candidates with scientific results that are sufficient to support further development and regulatory approval  receive the necessary regulatory approvals  obtain adequate supplies of surfactant active drug substances  manufactured to our specifications and on commercially reasonable terms  perform under agreements to supply drug substances  medical devices and related components and related services necessary to manufacture our kl surfactant product candidates  provide for sufficient manufacturing capabilities  at our manufacturing operations in totowa and with cmos  to produce sufficient drug product  including for kl surfactant related studies  aerosurf and surfaxin ls development activities  and cag devices and related materials to meet our preclinical and clinical development requirements  and obtain the capital necessary to fund our research and development efforts  including our business administration  preclinical and clinical organizations  and our quality and manufacturing operations 
because these factors  many of which are outside our control  could have a potentially significant impact on our development activities  the success  timing of completion and ultimate cost of development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty 
the timing and cost to complete drug trials alone may be impacted by  among other things slow patient enrollment  long treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness  lack of sufficient clinical supplies and material  adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients  lack of compatibility with complementary technologies  failure of a drug product candidate to demonstrate effectiveness  and lack of sufficient funds 
if we do not successfully complete clinical trials  we will not receive regulatory approval to market our kl surfactant pipeline products 
failure to obtain and maintain regulatory approval and generate revenues from the sale of our products would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and likely reduce the market value of our common stock 
our clinical trials may be delayed  or fail  which will harm our business 
we completed our pivotal phase clinical trials for surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants at high risk for rds and have conducted certain phase trials for other drug product candidates for other indications 
if we successfully advance our kl surfactant rds development programs through the initial preclinical phase of development  we plan to conduct phase clinical trials for aerosurf  potentially beginning in the fourth quarter of we also are assessing a potential development plan intended to gain marketing authorization for surfaxin ls  a lyophilized dosage form of surfaxin  in the us and potentially other selected markets and plan to seek a strategic alliance to support our efforts 
before we will initiate a clinical program  it will be important to secure adequate capital to support that activity 
such clinical programs generally take two to five years or more to complete and may be delayed by a number of factors 
we may not reach agreement with the fda or a foreign regulator on the design of any one or more of the clinical studies necessary for approval  or we may be unable to reach agreement on a single trial design that would permit us to conduct a single clinical program 
conditions imposed by the fda and foreign regulators on our clinical trials could significantly increase the time required for completion of such clinical trials and the costs of conducting the clinical trials 
for example  we may not be successful in achieving a trial design that is acceptable to the fda and regulators in other countries  which would cause us to greatly increase our investment or limit the scope of our activities 
like many biotechnology companies  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials or in preliminary findings for such clinical trials  we may suffer significant setbacks in late stage clinical trials 
data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
in addition  we may be unable to enroll patients quickly enough to meet our expectations for completing any or all of these trials 
the timing and completion of current and planned clinical trials of our product candidates depend on many factors  including the rate at which patients are enrolled 
delays in patient enrollment in clinical trials may occur  which would be likely to result in increased costs  program delays  or both 

table of contents patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the number of clinical sites  the size of the patient population  the number of clinical sites  the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to the clinical sites  the eligibility and enrollment criteria for the study  the willingness of patients or their parents or guardians to participate in the clinical trial  the existence of competing clinical trials  the existence of alternative available products  and geographical and geopolitical considerations 
if we succeed in achieving our patient enrollment targets  patients that enroll in our clinical trials could suffer adverse medical events or side effects that are known  such as a decrease in the oxygen level of the blood upon administration  or currently unknown to us 
it is also possible that we  our scientific advisory board sab  the data and safety monitoring committee dsmc  the fda or foreign regulators could interrupt  delay or halt any one or more of our clinical trials for any of our product candidates 
if our sab  the dsmc  any regulator or we believe that trial participants face unacceptable health risks  any one or more of our trials could be suspended or terminated 
in addition  clinical trials may be interrupted  delayed or halted  in whole or in part  for reasons other than health and safety concerns  including  among other things  matters related to the design of the study  drug availability  sab and or dsmc recommendation  or business reasons 
in addition to our planned clinical programs to support aerosurf and surfaxin ls  we also may initiate or support clinical studies evaluating other kl surfactant pipeline products 
all of these clinical trials will be time consuming and potentially costly 
should we fail to complete our clinical development programs or should such programs yield unacceptable results  such failures would have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to complete the development of our cag device and related componentry in a timely manner  if at all  would have a material adverse effect on our efforts to develop aerosurf or our other aerosolized kl surfactant products  and our business strategy 
we are currently working to develop an optimized cag device that is suitable for use in our planned phase and phase clinical trials 
our development activities are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation we may not successfully develop a cag device that is suitable for use in a clinical environment  if at all  on a timely basis and such inability may delay or prevent initiation of our planned clinical trials 
we will require access to sophisticated engineering capabilities 
we have medical device engineering staff with industry experience in developing medical devices  and are currently working with battelle  which has expertise in medical device development and medical device design and a successful track record in developing aerosolization systems for the medical and pharmaceutical industries 
if for any reason we are unable to retain our own engineering capabilities  the agreement with battelle is terminated  and we are unable to identify design engineers and medical device experts to support our development efforts  including for a clinic ready cag system for use in our planned clinical trials and  potentially  for later versions of the cag systems  it would have a material adverse effect on our business strategy and impair our ability to commercialize or develop aerosurf or other aerosolized kl surfactant products 
we will also require additional capital to advance our development activities and plan to seek a potential strategic partner or third party collaborator to provide financial support and potentially medical device development and commercialization expertise 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will successfully identify or be able to enter into agreements with such potential partners or collaborators on terms and conditions that are favorable to us 
if we are unable to secure the necessary medical device development expertise to support our development program  this could impair our ability to commercialize or develop aerosurf or other aerosolized kl surfactant products 

table of contents the realization of any of the foregoing risks would have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure in our information technology systems could disrupt our operations and cause the loss of confidential information  customers and business opportunities 
as we prepare for the commercialization of our first approved products  we will need extensive information technology it systems in virtually all aspects of our business  including billing  customer service  logistics and management of clinical trial and medical data management 
in selecting the appropriate software packages and systems to manage and support our activities  we will consider both in house development and specialty software and system packages offered by third party vendors  service providers and consultants 
the systems we select may not be adequate to meet our needs or may fail to perform to the specified requirements 
we may be required to seek other sources of system support  which would increase our costs and potentially delay our implementation of necessary activities 
there can be no assurance that the systems that we select or choose to develop will be adequate to our needs  that they will perform to our requirements or that we will be successful in integrating them into our operations 
in addition  our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire  power loss  system malfunction  unauthorized access and other events 
our success will depend  in part  on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our it systems 
it systems may be vulnerable to damage  disruptions and shutdown from a variety of sources  including telecommunications or network failures  human acts and natural disasters 
they also may be subject to physical or electronic intrusions  computer viruses  unauthorized tampering and similar disruptive problems 
likewise  data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public 
along with our new systems  we plan to take precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems 
nevertheless  we may experience damages to our systems  system failures and interruptions and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information  and our data could be compromised 
there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns  breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation  business  operations or financial condition of the company 
in addition  there can be no assurances that a significant implementation issue may not arise as we continue to implement new systems and consolidate or replace existing legacy systems 
if we experience systems problems  or if the systems we implement do not meet our expectations  they may interrupt our ability to operate 
if we experience systems problems  or if we experience unauthorized disclosure of confidential information  it could adversely affect our reputation  result in a loss of customers and revenues and cause us to suffer financial damage  including significant costs to alleviate or eliminate the problem 
if we do not adequately forecast customer demand for our approved products  including surfaxin and afectair  our business could suffer 
we are also subject to risks associated with doing business globally 
our business planning requires us to forecast demand and revenues despite numerous uncertainties 
actual results of operations may deviate materially from projected results 
the timing and amount of customer demand and the commercial requirements to meet changing customer demand are difficult to predict 
we may not be able to accurately forecast customer demand for our products and product candidates  starting with surfaxin and afectair  or to respond effectively to unanticipated increases in demand 
this could have an adverse effect on our business 
if we overestimate customer demand  or attempt to commercialize products for which the market is smaller than we anticipate  we could incur significant unrecoverable costs from creating excess capacity 
in addition  the current economic conditions may result in reduced demand for our products  increased pricing pressure  longer sales cycles  and slower adoption rates for our products 
conditions in the healthcare industry  including lower healthcare utilization  cost containment efforts by governments and other payers for healthcare services and other factors may result in weaker overall customer demand and increased pricing pressure for our products 
the current economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers  which could affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products 

table of contents we expect to offer certain of our products in the eu and elsewhere  which subjects us to risks associated with doing business globally and under the laws  regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies 
these risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in exchange controls  increasingly complex labor environments  expropriation and other governmental actions  availability of raw materials  changes in taxation  importation limitations  export control restrictions  changes in or violations of us or local laws  including the fcpa  pricing restrictions  economic and political instability  diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property  and disruption in a significant geographic region regardless of cause  including war  terrorism  riot  civil insurrection or social unrest 
failure to comply with  or material changes to  the laws and regulations that affect our business could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our ceff and atm program may become unavailable to us if we do not comply with their conditions 
except for our ceff and atm program which are subject to certain limitations  we currently do not have arrangements to obtain additional financing 
if we are unable to meet the conditions provided under the ceff and atm program  we will not be able to issue any portion of the shares potentially available for issuance thereunder and these programs may expire unutilized 
in addition  our ability to utilize the atm program or any new ceff in the future may be impaired 
in february  we issued five year warrants that contain anti dilution provisions that potentially adjust the exercise price of these warrants upon the issuance of securities at prices lower than the warrant exercise price 
the warrant anti dilution provisions are not triggered by draw downs under our existing ceff but are triggered by financings under the atm program or any new ceff 
in that event  the potential dilutive effect of a financing could be increased if the applicable purchase price of such financing is less than the exercise price of the warrants  which could result in a decline in the market price of our stock 
future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase our common stock  including pursuant to our ceff and atm program  stock incentive plans and upon the exercise of outstanding securities exercisable for shares of our common stock  could result in substantial additional dilution of our stockholders  cause our stock price to fall and adversely affect our ability to raise capital 
we will require additional capital to continue to execute our business plan and advance our research and development efforts 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the issuance of additional equity securities and through the exercise of outstanding warrants  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
we may sell shares of our common stock in one or more transactions at prices that may be at a discount to the then current market value of our common stock and on such other terms and conditions as we may determine from time to time 
any such transaction could result in substantial dilution of our existing stockholders 
if we sell shares of our common stock in more than one transaction  stockholders who purchase our common stock may be materially diluted by subsequent sales 
such sales could also cause a drop in the market price of our common stock 
the issuance of shares of our common stock under the ceff and the atm program has  and the issuance of shares upon exercise of the warrants we issued to kingsbridge in connection with our ceffs and to deerfield in connection with the deerfield facility will have  a dilutive impact on our other stockholders and the issuance  or even potential issuance  of such shares could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  if we access the atm program  we will pay a commission equal to three percent of the aggregate purchase price 
if we access the ceff  we will issue shares of our common stock to kingsbridge at a discount from to  depending upon the market price to the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on each trading day  which will further dilute the interests of other stockholders 
see  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources committed equity financing facility ceff 
furthermore  to the extent that kingsbridge sells to third parties the shares of our common stock that we sell to kingsbridge under the ceff  our stock price may decrease due to the additional selling pressure in the market 
the perceived risk of dilution from sales of stock to or by kingsbridge may cause holders of our common stock to sell their shares  or it may encourage short sales of our common stock or other similar transactions 
this could contribute to a decline in the stock price of our common stock 

table of contents we also filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec on form s file no 
on june  which was declared effective shortly thereafter for the proposed offering from time to time of up to million of our securities  including common stock  preferred stock  varying forms of debt and warrant securities  or any combination of the foregoing 
we have issued securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement on several occasions  and may do so again in the future in response to market conditions or other circumstances on terms and conditions that will be determined at such time 
as of march   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
in addition  as of december   approximately i million shares of our common stock were reserved for potential issuance upon the exercise of outstanding warrants  ii million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans  and iii  shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to our k plan 
the exercise of stock options and other securities could cause our stockholders to experience substantial dilution 
moreover  holders of our stock options and warrants are likely to exercise them  if ever  at a time when we otherwise could obtain a price for the sale of our securities that is higher than the exercise price per security of the options or warrants 
such exercises  or the possibility of such exercises  may impede our efforts to obtain additional financing through the sale of additional securities or make such financing more costly 
it may also reduce the price of our common stock 
if  during the term of certain of our warrants  we declare or make any dividend or other distribution of our assets to holders of shares of our common stock  by way of return of capital or otherwise including any distribution of cash  stock or other securities  property or options by way of a dividend  spin off  reclassification  corporate rearrangement or other similar transaction  then the exercise price of such warrants may adjust downward and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants would increase 
in addition  in february  we issued five year warrants that contain an anti dilution provision that  subject to certain exclusions  potentially adjusts the exercise price of these warrants upon the issuance of securities at prices lower than the warrant exercise price 
for the purpose of valuing securities that we may issue in the future in unit offerings  this anti dilution provision values the warrant portion of a unit offering based on a black scholes pricing model 
when such black scholes value is subtracted from the actual per unit price of the offering  per share value of the shares issued in such unit offering is decreased for the purposes of the anti dilution provision 
if we issue shares  units  or warrants in a financing that triggers the anti dilution provision of our february five year warrants  the exercise price of the february five year warrants will be lowered thereby  increasing the likelihood that such warrants would be exercised 
as a result of such warrant adjustments  we may be required to issue more shares of common stock  or shares at lower prices  than previously anticipated  which could result in further dilution of our existing stockholders 
the market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility 
the market price of our common stock  like that of many other development stage pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies  has been and is likely to be volatile 
in addition to general economic  political and market conditions  the price and trading volume of our stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors  including announcements of the results of clinical trials by us or our competitors  patient adverse reactions to drug products  governmental approvals  delays in expected governmental approvals or withdrawals of any prior governmental approvals or public or regulatory agency concerns regarding the safety or effectiveness of our products  changes in the us or foreign regulatory policy during the period of product development  changes in the us or foreign political environment and the passage of laws  including tax  environmental or other laws  affecting the product development business  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  including any third party challenges of our intellectual property rights  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  announcements of new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  actual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors  
table of contents changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether our earnings meet or exceed the estimates  conditions and trends in the pharmaceutical and other industries  new accounting standards  and the occurrence of any of the risks described in these risk factors or elsewhere in this annual report on form k or our other public filings 
our common stock is listed for quotation on the nasdaq capital market 
during the month period ended december   the price of our common stock ranged between and 
we expect the price of our common stock to remain volatile 
the average daily trading volume in our common stock varies significantly 
for the twelve month period ended december   the average daily trading volume in our common stock was approximately  shares  and the average number of transactions per day was approximately  the instability observed in our daily volume and number of transactions per day may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in the public market at prevailing prices 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of companies in our industry  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies in our industry 
even if securities class actions that may be filed against us in the future were ultimately determined to be meritless or unsuccessful  they would involve substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources  which could negatively affect our business 
if we fail to adhere to the strict listing requirements of the nasdaq capital market  we may be subject to delisting 
as a result  our stock price may decline and our common stock may be delisted 
if our stock were no longer listed on the nasdaq capital market  the liquidity of our securities likely would be impaired 
our common stock currently trades on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol dsco 
if we fail to adhere to the market s strict listing criteria  our stock may be delisted 
this could potentially impair the liquidity of our securities not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price  which might be depressed by the relative illiquidity  but also through delays in the timing of transactions and the potential reduction in media coverage 
as a result  an investor might find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock 
we believe that current and prospective investors would view an investment in our common stock more favorably if it continues to be listed on the nasdaq capital market 
any failure at any time to meet the continuing the nasdaq capital market listing requirements could have an adverse impact on the value of and trading activity in our common stock 
we expect to face uncertainty over reimbursement and healthcare reform 
in both the us and other countries  sales of our products will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third party payers  which include governmental health administration authorities  managed care providers and private health insurers 
government and other healthcare payers increasingly challenge the price and examine the cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
moreover  the current political environment in the us and abroad may result in the passage of significant legislation that could  among other things  restructure the markets in which we operate and restrict pricing strategies of drug development companies 
if  for example  price restrictions were placed on the distribution of our drugs  we may be forced to curtail development of our pipeline products and this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
even if we succeed in commercializing our drug products  uncertainties regarding health care policy  legislation and regulation  as well as private market practices  could affect our ability to sell our products in quantities or at prices that will enable us to achieve profitability 
to obtain reimbursement from a third party payer  it must determine that our drug product is a covered benefit under its health plan  which is likely to require a determination that our product is safe  effective and medically necessary  appropriate for the specific patient  cost effective  and neither experimental nor investigational 

table of contents obtaining a determination that a product is a covered benefit may be a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific  clinical and cost effectiveness data about our products to each payer 
we may not be able to provide sufficient data to gain coverage 
even when a payer determines that a product is covered  the payer may impose limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the fda or other regulatory authorities 
cost containment measures  if implemented to affect the coverage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products profitably 
moreover  coverage does not imply that any product will be covered in all cases or that reimbursement will be available at a rate that would permit a health care provider to cover its costs of using our product 
prices in many countries  including many in europe  are subject to local regulation and certain pharmaceutical products may be subject to price controls in several of the world s principal markets  including many countries within the eu 
in the us  where pricing levels for our products are substantially established by third party payers  if payers reduce the amount of reimbursement for a product  it may cause groups or individuals dispensing the product to discontinue administration of the product  to administer lower doses  to substitute lower cost products or to seek additional price related concessions 
these actions could have a negative effect on our financial results  particularly in cases where our products command a premium price in the marketplace 
the existence of direct and indirect price controls and pressures over our products could materially adversely affect our financial prospects and performance 
the implementation of the health care reform law in the us may adversely affect our business 
the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act  each enacted in march  generally known as the health care reform law  significantly expands health insurance coverage to uninsured americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers 
we expect expansion of access to health insurance may increase the demand for our products  but other provisions of the health care reform law could affect us adversely 
we also expect that further federal and state proposals for healthcare reform are likely 
the changes contemplated by the health care reform law are subject to rule making and implementation timelines that extend for several years  and this uncertainty limits our ability to forecast changes that may occur in the future 
however  any changes that lower reimbursements for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the health care reform law includes provisions  typically referred to as the federal physician payments sunshine act  that establish new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers 
under the law  pharmaceutical and device manufacturers are required to annually report various types of payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals 
although implementation of the sunshine provisions was initially delayed by the us centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  a final rule was released in february under the rule  applicable manufacturers must being tracking relevant payment data in august  and must report data collected between august and the end of to cms by march  cms will publish the data on a public website by september  inaccurate or incomplete reports may be subject to enforcement 
like the federal sunshine law  several states have existing laws that require manufacturers to report transfers of value to select healthcare providers licensed within the state  or even go so far as to prohibit certain marketing related activities 
other states  such as california  nevada  massachusetts and connecticut  require pharmaceutical and or device companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes 
in others  it is possible that we will be subject to the state s reporting requirements and prohibitions 
compliance activities with respect to these measures could increase our costs and adversely affect business operations 
the health care reform law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of medicare and medicaid  including imposing a excise tax on domestic sales of medical devices by manufacturers and importers beginning in  and a fee on branded prescription drugs that was implemented in  both of which may affect sales of our products 
as us net sales are expected to be a significant portion of our worldwide net sales in the coming years  this additional tax burden may have a material  negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows 
the health care reform law also mandates pharmacy benefit manager transparency regarding rebates  discounts and price concessions with respect to drug benefits under medicare part d  and in with respect to drug benefits offered through qualified health plans offered through state exchanges  which could affect pricing and competition 

table of contents political  economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations 
government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs  including price regulation  competitive pricing  coverage and payment policies  comparative effectiveness of therapies  technology assessments and managed care arrangements  are continuing in many countries where we plan to do business  including the us the health care reform law establishes the independent payment advisory board  which will be responsible  beginning in  annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing medicare cost growth while preserving quality 
these proposals automatically will be implemented unless congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets 
further  the legislation calls for a center for medicare and medicaid innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs 
the legislation provides for extensive health insurance reforms  including the elimination of pre existing condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage  fixed percentages on medical loss ratios  expansion in medicaid and other programs  employer mandates  individual mandates  creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges  and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurance coverage 
the legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations  a new healthcare delivery model 
while the ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown  it is likely to be extensive and may result in significant change 
our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results  which will likely result in significant legal and accounting expense and diversion of management resources  and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the market price of our stock will likely decline 
we are required by the sec to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we are likewise required  on a quarterly basis  to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls 
any failure to maintain internal controls could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis 
if our financial statements are not accurate  investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations 
likewise  if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the sec and the nasdaq capital market  we could face severe consequences from those authorities 
in either case  there could result a material adverse effect on our business 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
we can give no assurance that material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls 
in addition  in the future our controls and procedures may no longer be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
responding to inquiries from the sec or the nasdaq capital market  regardless of the outcome  are likely to consume a significant amount of our management resources and cause us to incur significant legal and accounting expense 
further  many companies that have restated their historical financial statements have experienced a decline in stock price and related stockholder lawsuits 
we depend upon key employees and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  it could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products 
we continue to implement our plan to hire additional qualified personnel to support i the commercialization of surfaxin and afectair  and ii the advancement of our aerosurf and surfaxin ls development programs 
in particular  we have established our field based sales and marketing and medical affairs organizations  and expect to hire for our regulatory affairs  quality control and assurance and administrative functions 
we compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies  universities and other research institutions 
competition for such individuals is significant and attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success  and any failure to do so successfully may have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents we are highly dependent upon the members of our executive management team and our directors  as well as our scientific advisory board members  consultants and collaborating scientists 
many of these individuals have been involved with us for many years  have played integral roles in our progress and we believe that they continue to provide value to us 
a loss of any of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on aspects of our business and clinical development and regulatory programs 
we have entered into employment agreements with five executive officers  including the president and chief executive officer and chief financial officer  the senior vice president and chief operating officer  the senior vice president  general counsel and corporate secretary  the senior vice president  human resources  and the senior vice president  research and development 
these agreements expire on may   subject to automatic renewal for an additional one year period  unless a party provides notice of non renewal at least days in advance 
the compensation committee of our board of directors committee directed that notices of non renewal be issued to all executive officers to provide an opportunity to replace the form of agreement 
in addition  with five other officers we have entered into retention agreements that also expire on may  we expect that  after the committee completes its review of current market information and other data  the committee will approve new forms of agreements for all executives 
the loss of services from any of our executives could significantly adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products and obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
further  we do not maintain key man life insurance 
as we prepare for the commercialization of our approved products  we need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to join our management  commercial  medical affairs and development teams  although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in that endeavor 
we may be unable to attract and retain necessary executive talent 
moreover  the equity incentives in the form of options that we have issued are  for the most part  significantly devalued or out of the money and less likely to be exercisable in the future 
our future success also will depend in part on the continued service of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
while we attempt to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain key personnel at all levels in our organization  many of our competitors have greater resources and more experience than we do  making it difficult for us to compete successfully for key personnel 
we may experience intense competition for qualified personnel and the existence of non competition agreements between prospective employees and their former employers may prevent us from hiring those individuals or subject us to lawsuits brought by their former employers 
our industry is highly competitive and we have less capital and resources than many of our competitors  which may give them an advantage in developing and marketing products similar to ours or make our products obsolete 
our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological innovation and evolving industry standards 
we compete with numerous existing companies in many ways 
we need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives 
the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy  safety  patients and clinicians ease of use and cost effectiveness involve significant technical and business risks 
the success of new product offerings will depend on many factors  including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs  adapt to new technologies  obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis  demonstrate satisfactory clinical results  manufacture products in an economic and timely manner  and differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
if we cannot successfully introduce new products  adapt to changing technologies or anticipate changes in our current and potential customers requirements  our products may become obsolete and our business could suffer 
we intend to market our products under development for the treatment of diseases for which other technologies and treatments are rapidly developing and  consequently  we expect new companies to enter our industry and that competition in the industry will increase 
many of these companies have substantially greater research and development  manufacturing  marketing  financial  technological  personnel and managerial resources than we have 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or with their collaborative partners  have significantly greater experience than we do in 
table of contents developing products  developing products  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals or products  and manufacturing and marketing products 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda or foreign regulatory approval or commercializing products before us 
our competitors may successfully secure regulatory exclusivities in various markets  which could have the effect of barring us or limiting our ability to market our products in such markets 
as we commence commercial product sales  we will compete against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities that may successfully develop and commercialize products that are more effective or less expensive than our products 
as none of our products are available at this time  we currently have limited or no experience in these areas 
in addition  developments by our competitors may render our drug product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive 
we also face  and will continue to face  competition from colleges  universities  governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations 
these competitors frequently aggressively seek patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technology that they have developed 
some of these technologies may compete directly with the technologies that we are developing 
these institutions will also compete with us in recruiting highly qualified scientific personnel 
we expect that therapeutic developments in the areas in which we are active may occur at a rapid rate and that competition will intensify as advances in this field are made 
as a result  we need to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to research and development activities 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property  other companies could use our technology in competitive products 
even if we obtain patents to protect our products  those patents may not be sufficiently broad or they may expire and others could then compete with us 
we seek patent protection for our drug product candidates to prevent others from commercializing equivalent products in substantially less time and at substantially lower expense 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success will depend in part on our ability and that of parties from whom we license technology to successfully obtain patents  defend our patents  protect our trade secrets  and otherwise prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights 
the patent position of companies relying upon biotechnology is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
to date  the united states patent and trademark office uspto has not adopted a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that it will allow in biotechnology patents or the degree of protection that these types of patents afford 
as a result  there are risks that we may not secure rights to products or processes that appear to be patentable 
the parties licensing technologies to us and we have filed various us and foreign patent applications with respect to the products and technologies under our development  and the uspto and foreign patent offices have issued patents with respect to our products and technologies 
these patent applications include international applications filed under the patent cooperation treaty 
our pending patent applications  those we may file in the future or those we may license from third parties may not result in the uspto or foreign patent office issuing patents 
in addition  if patent rights covering our products are not sufficiently broad  they may not provide us with sufficient proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products and technologies 
furthermore  even if the uspto or foreign patent offices were to issue patents to us or our licensors  others may challenge the patents or circumvent the patents  or the patent office or the courts may invalidate the patents 
thus  any patents we own or license from third parties may not provide us any protection against competitors 

table of contents the patents that we hold also have a limited life 
we have licensed a series of patents for our kl surfactant technology from j j and its wholly owned subsidiary ortho pharmaceutical corporation ortho pharmaceutical  which are important  both individually and collectively  to our strategy of commercializing our kl surfactant products 
these patents  which include important kl composition of matter claims and relevant european patents  began to expire in november  and will expire on various dates ending in or  in some cases  possibly later 
of the patents that have expired  we have extended the term of our most important patent until november  with further extensions possible into for our aerosolized kl surfactant  we hold worldwide exclusive licenses from pmusa and pmpsa to the cag technology for use with pulmonary surfactants together or in combination with other products for all respiratory diseases 
our exclusive license in the us also extends to other non surfactant drugs to treat a wide range of pediatric and adult respiratory indications in hospitals and other health care institutions 
the cag technology patents expire on various dates beginning in may and ending in  or  in some cases  possibly later 
we have filed  and when possible and appropriate  will file  other patent applications with respect to our products and processes in the us and in foreign countries 
we may not be able to develop enhanced or additional products or processes that will be patentable under patent law and  if we do enhance or develop additional products that we believe are patentable  additional patents may not be issued to us 
see also  if we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements  we could lose the rights to our products 
our technology platform is based solely on our proprietary kl surfactant technology  our novel cag technology  and our novel aerosol conducting airway connectors 
our technology platform is based on the scientific rationale of using our kl surfactant technology  our cag technology and our novel patient interface and related componentry to treat life threatening respiratory disorders and to serve as the foundation for the development of novel respiratory therapies and products 
our business is dependent upon the successful development and approval of our drug product candidates and our drug device combination products based on these technologies 
any material problems with our technology platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business 
intellectual property rights of third parties could limit our ability to develop and market our products 
our commercial success also depends upon our ability to operate our business without infringing the patents or violating the proprietary rights of others 
in certain cases  the uspto keeps us patent applications confidential while the applications are pending 
as a result  we cannot determine in advance what inventions third parties may claim in their pending patent applications 
we may need to defend or enforce our patent and license rights or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others through legal proceedings  which would be costly  unpredictable and time consuming 
even in proceedings where the outcome is favorable to us  they would likely divert substantial resources  including management time  from our other activities 
moreover  any adverse determination could subject us to significant liability or require us to seek licenses that third parties might not grant to us or might only grant at rates that diminish or deplete the profitability of our products 
an adverse determination could also require us to alter our products or processes or cease altogether any product sales or related research and development activities 
if we cannot meet requirements under our license agreements  we could lose the rights to our products 
we depend on licensing agreements with third parties to maintain the intellectual property rights to our products under development 
presently  we have licensed rights from j j  ortho pharmaceutical  pmusa  pmpsa and the scripps institute 
these agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations to maintain our rights under these licensing agreements 
all of these agreements last either throughout the life of the patents or for a number of years after the first commercial sale of the relevant product 
in addition  we are responsible for the cost of filing and prosecuting certain patent applications and maintaining certain issued patents licensed to us 
if we do not meet our obligations under our license agreements in a timely manner  we could lose the rights to our proprietary technology 
finally  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies 
licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights might not be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we rely on confidentiality agreements that could be breached and may be difficult to enforce 
although we take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property  including the use of agreements relating to the non disclosure of our confidential information to third parties  as well as agreements that provide for disclosure and assignment to us of all rights to the ideas  developments  discoveries and inventions of our employees and consultants while we employ them  such agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce 
we generally seek to enter into these types of agreements with consultants  advisors and research collaborators  however  to the extent that such parties apply or independently develop intellectual property in connection with any of our projects  disputes may arise concerning allocation of the related proprietary rights 
such disputes often involve significant expense and yield unpredictable results 
in addition  we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors or others 

table of contents despite the protective measures we employ  we still face the risk that agreements may be breached  agreements may not provide adequate remedies for the applicable type of breach  our trade secrets or proprietary know how may otherwise become known  our competitors may independently develop similar technology  or our competitors may independently discover our proprietary information and trade secrets 
moreover  although all employees enter into agreements with us that include non compete covenants  and our five senior executive officers have agreements that include broader non competition covenants and provide for severance payments that are contingent upon the applicable employee s refraining from competition with us  such non compete provisions can be difficult and costly to monitor and enforce  such that  if any should resign  we may not be successful in enforcing our noncompetition agreements with them 
the failure to prevail in litigation or the costs of litigation  including securities class action  product liability and patent infringement claims  could harm our financial performance and business operations 
we are potentially susceptible to litigation 
for example  as a public company  we may be subject to claims asserting violations of securities laws 
even if such actions are found to be without merit  the potential impact of such actions  which generally seek unquantifiable damages and attorneys fees and expenses  is uncertain 
there can be no assurance that an adverse result in any future proceeding would not have a potentially material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business activities  including manufacturing and marketing our drug products and medical devices also exposes us to liability risks 
using our drug product candidates or medical devices in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims 
for our products that are approved for commercial sale  the risk of product liability claims is increased 
even if approved  our products may be subject to claims resulting from unintended effects that result in injury or death 
in addition  we may be subject to product liability claims involving our afectair and other medical devices and alleged design defects or other safety issues that result in an unsafe condition leading to injury or death 
product liability claims alleging inadequate disclosure and warnings in our package inserts and medical device disclosures also may arise 
the design  manufacture and marketing of surfaxin and the afectair devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims 
there are a number of factors that could result in an unsafe condition or injury to a patient  including manufacturing flaws  design defects or inadequate disclosure of product related risks or product related information 
product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class 
the outcome of litigation  particularly class action lawsuits  is difficult to assess or quantify 
plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts  and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
we presently carry general liability  excess liability  products liability and property insurance coverage in amounts that are customary for companies in our industry of comparable size and level of activity 
however  our insurance policies contain various deductibles  limitations and exclusions from coverage  and in any event might not fully cover any potential claims 
there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements  or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us  could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation 

table of contents we may need to obtain additional product liability insurance coverage  including with locally authorized insurers licensed in countries where we market our approved products or conduct our clinical trials  before initiating clinical trials  however  such insurance is expensive and may not be available when we need it 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance  with acceptable limits and retentions  at an acceptable cost 
any product  general liability or product liability claim  even if such claim is within the limits of our insurance coverage or meritless and or unsuccessful  could adversely affect the availability or cost of insurance generally and our cash available for other purposes  such as research and development 
in addition  such claims could result in uninsured expenses related to defense or payment of substantial monetary awards to claimants  a decrease in demand for our drug product candidates  damage to our reputation  and an inability to complete clinical trial programs or to commercialize our drug product candidates  if approved 
moreover  the existence of a product liability claim could affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  as the uspto keeps us patent applications confidential in certain cases while the applications are pending  we cannot ensure that our products or methods do not infringe upon the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are applied for and issued  the risk increases that our patents or patent applications for our kl surfactant product candidates or our device related patent applications may give rise to a declaration of interference by the uspto  or to administrative proceedings in foreign patent offices  or that our activities lead to claims of patent infringement by other companies  institutions or individuals 
these entities or persons could bring legal proceedings against us seeking to invalidate our patents  obtain substantial damages or enjoin us from conducting research and development activities 
our corporate compliance program cannot ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations affecting our activities in the jurisdictions in which we may sell our products  if approved  and a failure to comply with such regulations or prevail in litigation related to noncompliance could harm our business 
many of our activities  including the research  development  manufacture  sale and marketing of our products  are subject to extensive laws and regulation  including without limitation  health care fraud and abuse laws  such as the federal false claims act  the federal anti kickback statute  and other state and federal laws and regulations 
we have developed and implemented a corporate compliance policy and oversight program based upon what we understand to be current industry best practices  but we cannot assure you that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations 
if any such investigations  actions or lawsuits are instituted against us  and if we are not successful in defending or disposing of them without liability  such investigations  actions or lawsuits could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions and could otherwise have a significant impact on our business 
provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  our amended and restated by laws  our shareholder rights agreement and delaware law could defer a change of our management and thereby discourage or delay offers to acquire us 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  our amended and restated by laws  our shareholder rights agreement and delaware law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or for our stockholders to remove existing management  and might discourage a third party from offering to acquire us  even if a change in control or in management would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval 
as a result  our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation  the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares  together with a premium  before the redemption of our common stock 
in addition  our board of directors  without further stockholder approval  could issue large blocks of preferred stock 
we have adopted a shareholder rights agreement  which under certain circumstances would significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us without prior approval of our board of directors thereby discouraging unsolicited takeover proposals 
the rights issued under the shareholder rights agreement would cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our board of directors 

table of contents we are engaged in discussions with potential strategic partners who could provide development and commercial expertise as well as financial resources potentially in the form of upfront payments  milestone payments  commercialization royalties and a sharing of research and development expenses 
we have also considered various other financial alternatives that could potentially provide infusions of capital and other resources needed to advance our kl surfactant pipeline programs meet our capital requirements and continue our operations 
although we continue to consider potential opportunities  there can be no assurance that any strategic alliance or other financing alternatives will be successfully concluded 
we plan to continue assessing available opportunities with a view to maintaining and strengthening our financial and operational position 
moreover  consideration and planning of such strategic alliances diverts management s attention and other resources from day to day operations  which may subject us to further risks and uncertainties

our discussion is organized as follows company overview and business strategy this section provides a general description of our company and business plans 
critical accounting policies this section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require the exercise of judgment and use of estimates on the part of management in their application

overview discovery laboratories  inc referred to as we  us  or the company is a specialty biotechnology company focused on creating life saving products for critical care patients with respiratory disease and improving the standard of care in pulmonary medicine 
our proprietary drug technology produces a synthetic  peptide containing surfactant kl surfactant that is structurally similar to pulmonary surfactant  a substance produced naturally in the lung and essential for normal respiratory function and survival 
we are developing our kl surfactant in liquid  lyophilized and aerosolized dosage forms 
we are also developing novel drug delivery technologies potentially to enable efficient delivery of aerosolized drugs  including our aerosolized kl surfactant  and other inhaled therapies 
we believe that our proprietary technologies make it possible  for the first time  to develop a significant pipeline of products to address a variety of respiratory diseases for which there frequently are few or no approved therapies 
our initial strategy is to develop our kl surfactant and drug delivery technologies to improve the management of respiratory distress syndrome rds in premature infants 
rds is a serious respiratory condition caused by insufficient surfactant production in underdeveloped lungs of premature infants  and the most prevalent respiratory disease in the neonatal intensive care unit nicu 
rds can result in long term respiratory problems  developmental delay and death 
mortality and morbidity rates associated with rds have not meaningfully improved over the last decade 
we believe that the rds market is presently underserved  and that our rds programs have the potential to greatly improve the management of rds and  collectively over time  to become a new standard of care for premature infants with rds 

table of contents on march   the us food and drug administration fda granted us marketing approval for surfaxin lucinactant for the prevention of rds in premature infants at high risk for rds 
surfaxin is the first synthetic  peptide containing surfactant approved for use in neonatal medicine and provides healthcare practitioners with an alternative to the animal derived surfactants that today are the standard of care to manage rds in premature infants 
see  surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants rds surfaxin for the prevention of rds in premature infants at high risk for rds 
see also  proprietary platform surfactant and aerosol technologies our kl surfactant technology 
in the third quarter of  during a routine review of the results and processes related to the analytical testing and quality control of surfaxin drug product  we determined that one of our analytical chemistry methods used to assess surfaxin drug product conformance to specifications required improvement and that an update to product specifications was needed 
we proactively communicated these findings to the fda  improved and validated the analytical chemistry method  and submitted updated product specifications to the fda 
as a result of these efforts  we delayed the commercial availability of surfaxin drug product 
although there can be no assurances  if we are able to successfully conclude our planned activities and receive confirmation of our updated product specifications from the fda within our anticipated timeline in the second quarter of  we believe that we remain on track to manufacture surfaxin drug product for commercial use in the second quarter of this delay in availability of surfaxin drug product from the fourth quarter to the second quarter of is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position  in part because our commercial launch plans for surfaxin during this period have always been to focus initially on hospital formulary acceptance 
aerosurf is a drug device combination product that combines our kl surfactant with our proprietary capillary aerosol generator cag 
we are developing aerosurf for premature infants with or at risk for developing rds 
premature infants with rds currently are treated with surfactants that can only be administered by endotracheal intubation supported with mechanical ventilation  both invasive procedures that frequently result in serious respiratory conditions and complications 
consequently  neonatologists generally will not treat infants who could benefit from surfactant therapy unless they determine that the potential benefits of surfactant therapy outweigh the risks associated with such invasive administration procedures 
aerosurf potentially will provide practitioners with the ability to deliver surfactant therapy using a less invasive method 
for this reason  we believe that aerosurf  if approved  potentially may enable the treatment of a significantly greater number of premature infants at risk for rds who could benefit from surfactant therapy but are currently not treated 
see  surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants rds aerosurf for rds in premature infants 
we are developing a lyophilized freeze dried dosage form of our kl surfactant that is stored as a powder and resuspended to liquid form prior to use with the objective of improving ease of use for healthcare practitioners  as well as potentially to prolong shelf life and eliminate the need for cold chain storage 
we are engaged in a technology transfer of our lyophilized kl surfactant manufacturing process to a contract manufacturing organization cmo that has expertise in lyophilized products  and we expect that it will manufacture drug product for use in our preclinical and clinical development activities 
our development plan is intended initially to support the use of our lyophilized kl surfactant in our aerosurf development program 
we are also assessing a potential development plan intended to gain marketing authorization for surfaxin ls  a lyophilized dosage form of surfaxin  in the united states us and potentially other major markets 
afectair devices are our novel disposable aerosol conducting airway connectors that simplify the delivery of aerosolized medications including our aerosolized kl surfactant and other inhaled therapies to critical care patients requiring ventilatory support by introducing the aerosolized medication directly at the patient interface and minimizing the number of connections in the ventilator circuit 
in february  we registered our afectair device in the us as a class i  exempt medical device 
our initial device is afectair aerosol conducting airway connector for infants receiving aerosolized medication in neonatal or pediatric intensive care units nicus and picus  respectively 
we are initiating a user experience program that is being conducted in select us critical care centers that represent approximately ten percent of our target institutions 
this initial phase  which is intended to facilitate peer to peer exchange among physicians and respiratory therapists and enable discussion about the potential advantages and proper utilization of this novel device  is expected to be conducted in the first half of following the initial phase  we expect to initiate a broader introduction of the afectair device for infants in a national phase 
we believe that afectair aerosol conducting airway connectors have the potential to become a new standard of care for the delivery of aerosolized medications and inhaled therapies to infants receiving aerosolized medication in the nicu and picu 
we believe that revenues from the afectair device for infants in the fourth full selling year could potentially be million in the us and million globally 

table of contents we expect that we will be able to leverage the information  data and know how that we gain from our development efforts with aerosurf for rds and the afectair device for infants to support development of a product pipeline intended to address serious critical care respiratory conditions of larger children and adults in picus and intensive care units icus 
however  we are delaying these development efforts in the near term in order to focus our resources and expertise on meeting our goals to advance our development program for aerosurf to phase clinical trials and execute the commercial introduction of surfaxin and the afectair device for infants 
if we are able to achieve our objectives  we believe we will be in a better position to assess the potential of developing products based on our cag and aerosol conductor airway connector technologies to address the critical care needs of patients in the picu and icu 
in the us  we have established our own specialty respiratory critical care commercial and medical affairs organizations that are experienced in and will focus on neonatal indications 
these organizations will be primarily responsible to effect the commercial introduction of surfaxin 
with our established relationships and contacts in the neonatal community  we believe that we also will be able to use our commercial and medical affairs organizations to effectively introduce the afectair device for infants in the us we also expect that  in the future  these teams will be able to leverage the experience and relationships that we gain with the introduction of surfaxin and the afectair device for infants to efficiently support the introductions of aerosurf and surfaxin ls  if approved 
an important priority is to secure strategic resources to support the continued development and commercial introduction of our rds products 
while we currently intend to retain all rights and commercialize our approved products in the us  we are focused on identifying potential strategic alliances to assist us in markets outside the us we seek strategic partners that have broad experience in the designated markets  including regulatory and product development expertise as well as  if our products are approved  an ability to commercialize our products 
in addition to development and commercial support  such alliances typically also would provide us with financial resources to support our efforts  potentially in the form of upfront payments  milestone payments  commercialization royalties and a sharing of research and development expenses 
in  we are focused on securing a significant strategic alliance predominantly focused on the eu 
in our discussions to date  the primary focus of our discussions has been on aerosurf 
we also would consider various financing alternatives or collaboration arrangements that would provide infusions of capital and other resources needed to advance our kl surfactant development programs 
we may also seek strategic alliances and or collaboration arrangements to support the potential commercial introduction of surfaxin and  if approved  surfaxin ls in countries where regulatory marketing authorization is facilitated by the information contained in our surfaxin new drug application nda approved by the fda 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in concluding any strategic alliance  collaboration or other similar transaction 
the reader is referred to  and encouraged to read in its entirety item business of this annual report on form k  which contains a discussion of our business and business strategy  as well as information concerning our proprietary technologies and our current and planned kl pipeline programs 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
for further discussion of our accounting policies  see  note summary of significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   in part iv to this annual report on form k 
research and development expenses research and development costs consist primarily of expenses associated with our personnel  facilities  manufacturing operations  pharmaceutical and device development  research  clinical  regulatory  other preclinical and clinical activities and medical affairs 
research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
warrant accounting we account for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in accounting standards codification asc topic derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity  as either derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement 
we classify derivative warrant liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as a current liability  which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance 
we use the black scholes or trinomial pricing models  depending on the terms of a warrant agreement  to value the derivative warrant liabilities 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as change in the fair value of common stock warrant liability 
see  results of operations change in fair value of common stock warrant liability 
inventory inventories are determined at the lower of cost or market value with cost determined under the specific identification method 
in connection with the fda s approval of surfaxin and the registration of our initial afectair device in the us  we assessed the potential capitalization of inventory and the timing of when the related costs are expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of our products 
costs incurred prior to receipt of marketing authorization have been recorded in our statement of operations as research and development expense 
as a result  inventory balances and cost of revenue may reflect a lower average per unit cost of materials for several quarters after we launch our products 
as of december   inventories were valued at million and consisted of raw materials used in the production of surfaxin 
results of operations net loss and operating loss the net loss for the years ended december   and was million or per share  million or per share and million or per share  respectively 
included in the net loss is the change in fair value of certain common stock warrants classified as derivative liabilities  resulting in non cash income of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the operating loss for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the operating loss includes million  million and million for non cash items related to depreciation and stock based compensation for  and  respectively 
excluding non cash items related to depreciation and stock based compensation  the operating loss was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in operating loss from to is primarily due to investments that we have made i to establish our own specialty respiratory critical care commercial and medical affairs organizations that are experienced in and will focus on neonatal indications  beginning with surfaxin and the afectair device for infants 
with the information gained and relationships developed during the surfaxin introduction  we anticipate that these teams may be able to efficiently effect the commercial introduction of aerosurf and surfaxin ls  if approved  and ii to advance the development of our cag for potential use in our planned aerosurf phase clinical program in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents grant revenue for the year ended december   we recognized million of grant revenue for funds received and expended under a small business innovation research sbir phase i award from national institute of health s nih national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid center for medical counter measures against radiation and nuclear threats to assess the ability of kl surfactant to mitigate the effects of acute radiation exposure to the lung  including acute pneumonitis and delayed lung injury 
we believe that our aerosolized kl surfactant may be an effective intervention for people at risk for  or with  acute lung injury ali  and that our development work with aerosurf for rds may form the basis for a pipeline of products to address ali 
we are collaborating with leading research institutions in a series of preclinical studies funded through various us government sponsored  biodefense related initiatives  including niaid 
the total amount of the award is  and the remainder of the award is expected to be received and expended in for the year ended december   we recognized million of revenue for funds received and expended under a fast track sbir from nih to support the development of aerosolized kl surfactant for rds 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred and we track such costs by category rather than by project 
as many of our research and development activities form a foundation for the development of our kl surfactant and drug delivery technologies  they benefit more than a single project 
for that reason  we cannot reasonably estimate the costs or our research and development activities on a project by project basis 
we believe that tracking our expenses by category is a more accurate method of accounting for these activities 
our research and development costs consist primarily of expenses associated with a manufacturing and product development  b medical and regulatory operations  and c direct preclinical and clinical programs 
we also track research and development by major expense category as follows i salaries and benefits  ii contracted services  iii rents and utilities  iv depreciation  v raw materials and supplies  vi contract manufacturing  vii stock based compensation and viii other 
research and development expenses by category are as follows years ended december  in thousands product development and manufacturing medical and regulatory operations direct preclinical and clinical programs total research and development expenses certain prior year expenses have been reclassified to conform to presentation

we are also assessing a potential development plan intended to gain marketing authorization for surfaxin lstm  a lyophilized dosage form of surfaxin  in the us and potentially other major markets 
to prepare for initiation of our aerosurf clinical program  we have conducted preliminary meetings with the fda and we have engaged regulatory consultants to assist us in implementing and  as needed  refining our development plan 
we also plan to retain regulatory consultants to assist us in engaging international regulatory authorities regarding the aerosurf development plan 
we expect that we will use our lyophilized kl surfactant for aerosurf 
we have discussed with the fda a proposed development program for surfaxin ls and expect to engage in further discussions with the fda 
once we have secured the necessary capital  we plan to implement a regulatory plan intended to gain marketing authorization for surfaxin ls in the us  and thereafter potentially in other selected markets

research and development expense by major expense category we also track our research and development expense by major expense category as shown in the following table in thousands years ended december  salaries benefits contracted services raw materials supplies rents utilities depreciation contract manufacturing travel stock based compensation all other total 
table of contents the increase in salaries and benefits from to is primarily due to the establishment of our medical affairs organization to support the commercial introduction of surfaxin and the afectair device for infants  increased benefit costs and employee incentive payments 
the increase in salaries and benefits in from to was primarily due to increased benefit costs  employee incentive payments and employee severance costs 
contracted services include the cost of preclinical studies  clinical trial activities  certain components of our manufacturing operations  quality control and analytical testing of our drug product  including our bat  consulting services  aerosol device design and engineering services  etc 
the increase from to is primarily due to costs associated with work that we began in june with battelle to optimize design  test  and manufacture clinic ready cag devices to be used in the first phase of our planned aerosurf phase clinical trial in the fourth quarter of  and investments in our manufacturing and quality activities as we prepare for the commercial introduction of surfaxin and the afectair device for infants 
the decrease from to is primarily due to the completion of the phase arf clinical trial in and a decrease in in outside laboratory testing related to activities as we completed work to respond to the complete response letter 
raw materials and supplies consist of purchases of our active pharmaceutical ingredients apis for the manufacture of our kl surfactant product candidates and supplies to support our manufacturing and analytical testing and development laboratories operations 
in addition  raw materials and supplies include component parts used in the development of our cag and raw materials and supplies used in manufacturing and product development activities for our afectair aerosol conducting airway connectors 
the decrease in raw materials and supplies from to is primarily due to a decrease in raw material purchases following submission in of our response to the complete response letter 
the increase in raw materials and supplies from to was primarily due to the manufacture of surfaxin drug product for preclinical studies to support our response to the complete response letter 
rents and utilities are costs related to our leased manufacturing  laboratory and related facilities 
the decrease from to is primarily due to decreased utility costs at our manufacturing facility associated with a decrease in the number of batches of surfaxin drug product manufactured 
depreciation is primarily associated with leasehold improvements at our laboratories and headquarters in warrington  pennsylvania as well as manufacturing and laboratory equipment  and leasehold improvements at our manufacturing operations in totowa  new jersey 
the decrease from to is primarily due to capitalized assets becoming fully depreciated during contract manufacturing represents costs related to the technology transfer of our lyophilized kl manufacturing process to a cgmp compliant cmo with expertise in manufacturing lyophilized drug products 
the decrease in contract manufacturing costs over the three year period is due to pacing of our technology transfer activities while we focused our efforts on responding to the complete response letter and securing marketing authorization for surfaxin 
contract manufacturing costs are expected to increase in since we have restarted our technology transfer activities 
the category all other consists primarily of ongoing research and development costs such as insurance  taxes  education and training and software licenses 
research and development projects a substantial portion of our cumulative losses to date  of which million is associated with the three year period ended december   relate to investments in our research and development projects 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in clinical development and the regulatory approval processes  the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete individual projects in development are not reasonably estimable 
with every phase of a development project  there are significant unknowns that may significantly affect cost projections and timelines 
as a result of the number and nature of these factors  many of which are outside our control  the success  timing of completion and ultimate cost  of development of any of our product candidates is highly uncertain and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty 

table of contents for a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties affecting our ability to estimate projections and timelines  see  item business government regulation  and item a risk factors the regulatory approval process for our products is expensive and time consuming and the outcome is uncertain 
we may not obtain required regulatory approvals for the commercialization of our products  our research and development activities involve significant risks and uncertainties that are inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  our clinical trials may be delayed  or fail  which will harm our business  manufacturing problems potentially could cause us to delay preclinical or clinical programs  or  if our products are approved  product launch  or cause us to experience shortages of products inventories  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  as well as elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our initial kl surfactant drug product  surfaxin  was approved for marketing in the us in march also in  we registered our afectair device in the us and expect to complete the registration of the afectair device in the eu in although we have two commercial products at this time  neither is broadly available for commercial sale 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in commercializing these products or in realizing a profit in the foreseeable future 
our lead kl surfactant drug development programs  aerosurf and surfaxin ls  are focused on the management of rds in premature infants 
we believe that these programs have the potential to greatly improve the management of rds and expand the current rds market in our target markets 
we plan in to seek regulatory and scientific guidance with respect to our planned development programs for aerosurf and initiate the phase clinical program for aerosurf 
we also are assessing a potential development plan intended to gain marketing authorization for surfaxin ls  a lyophilized dosage form of surfaxin  in the us and potentially other selected markets and plan to seek a strategic alliance to support our efforts 
however  our ability to move forward with our planned clinical programs will depend upon the success of our efforts to complete our development activities  secure strategic alliances and or necessary capital to support these activities 
if we are successful within our target time frame  we expect to initiate our phase clinical programs for aerosurf in the fourth quarter of however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing our development activities and securing a strategic alliance or capital  if at all  and within our anticipated time frames 
accordingly  we are unable to reliably project when we might implement these programs  the pace of such implementation or the overall anticipated expense that we might incur 
the status of our lead projects and our other pipeline candidates  including the potential timing and milestones for each  is discussed in item business surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine 
see also  item business business strategy  and item a risk factors we may not successfully develop and market our products  and even if we do  we may not become profitable  we will require significant additional capital to continue our planned research and development activities and continue to operate as a going concern 
moreover  such additional financing could result in equity dilution 
we believe that our kl surfactant technology has the potential to be developed into a broad product pipeline that could address a variety of debilitating respiratory conditions in patient populations ranging from premature infants to adults 
at the present time  we plan to focus our resources on rds programs 
however  we also plan to consider opportunistically sponsoring and supporting third party investigator initiated preclinical and clinical programs directed at establishing proof of concept through phase studies for ali 
if successful  we plan to assess the potential markets for these products and determine whether to seek strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements  or utilize other financial alternatives to fund their further development 
see  item business business strategy  and surfactant replacement therapy for respiratory medicine 
ultimately  if we do not successfully develop and gain marketing approval for our drug product candidates  in the us or elsewhere  we will not be able to commercialize  or generate any revenues from the sale of our products and the value of our company and our financial condition and results of operations will be substantially harmed

change in fair value of common stock warrant liability in thousands years ended december  change in fair value of common stock warrant liability 
table of contents we account for common stock warrants in accordance with applicable accounting guidance provided in asc topic  either as derivative liabilities or as equity instruments depending on the specific terms of the warrant agreement 
derivative warrant liabilities are valued at the date of initial issuance and as of each subsequent balance sheet date using the black scholes or trinomial pricing models  depending on the terms of the applicable warrant agreement 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as change in the fair value of common stock warrant liability 
the registered warrants that we issued in our may and february public offerings generally provide that  in the event a related registration statement or an exemption from registration is not available for the issuance or resale of the warrant shares upon exercise of the warrant  the holder may exercise the warrant on a cashless basis 
notwithstanding the availability of cashless exercise  generally accepted accounting principles gaap provide that these registered warrants are deemed to be subject to potential net cash settlement and must be classified as derivative liabilities because i under federal securities laws  providing freely tradable shares upon exercise of the warrants may not be within our control in all circumstances  and ii the warrant agreements do not expressly provide that there is no circumstance in which we may be required to effect a net cash settlement of the warrants 
the accounting guidance expressly precludes an evaluation of the likelihood that cash settlement could occur 
accordingly  the may and february warrants have been classified as derivative liabilities and reported  at each balance sheet date  at estimated fair value determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the form of warrant agreement for the registered five year warrants that we issued in the february public offering february five year warrants expressly provides that under no circumstances will we be required to effect a net cash settlement of these warrants 
however  these warrants contain anti dilutive provisions that adjust the exercise price if we issue any common stock  securities convertible into common stock  or other securities subject to certain exceptions at a value below the then existing exercise price of the february five year warrants 
due to the nature of the anti dilution provisions  these warrants have been classified as derivative liabilities and reported  at each balance sheet date  at estimated fair value determined using a trinomial pricing model 
changes in our common stock warrant liability are primarily related to changes in our common stock share price during the periods

liquidity and capital resources we have incurred substantial losses since inception  due to investments in research and development  manufacturing and potential commercialization activities  and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses over the next several years 
historically  we have funded our business operations through various sources  including public and private securities offerings  draw downs under a series of committed equity financing facilities ceffs and a previous at the market program that we entered in december with lazard capital markets lazard atm program  capital equipment and debt facilities  and strategic alliances 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital  to fund our research and development and commercial programs and meet our obligations on a timely basis 
before additional financing activities  including the second disbursement under the deerfield facility and under the atm program  as discussed below  we anticipate that we have sufficient cash available to support our operations and debt service obligations through the third quarter of if we are unable to successfully raise sufficient additional capital  through future debt and equity financings and or strategic and collaborative arrangements with potential partners  we will likely not have sufficient cash flows and liquidity to fund our business operations  which could significantly limit our ability to continue as a going concern 
in that event  we may be forced to further limit development of many  if not all  of our programs and consider other means of creating value for our stockholders  such as licensing the development and or commercialization of products that we consider valuable and might otherwise plan to develop ourselves 
if we are unable to raise the necessary capital  we may be forced to curtail all of our activities and  ultimately  cease operations 
even if we are able to raise additional capital  such financings may only be available on unattractive terms  or could result in significant dilution of stockholders interests and  in such event  the market price of our common stock may decline 
our december  financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in existence 
to execute our business strategy and fund our operations over time  we will require additional infusions of capital until such time as the net revenues from surfaxin and afectair  from potential strategic alliance and collaboration arrangements and from other sources are sufficient to offset cash flow requirements 
given the time required to secure formulary acceptance at our target hospitals and acceptance of a new product  we expect our revenues from surfaxin and afectair will not increase immediately but rather slowly over a period of years 
as a result  our investments in our operations are expected to outpace the rate at which we generate revenues in the near term 
even if we are successful in executing the commercial introduction of these products within our planned timeframe  we will require significant additional capital to support our operations 
we expect that we may potentially secure additional capital under our deerfield facility discussed below as well as equity public offerings and other financing transactions  including but not limited to our june ceff with kingsbridge capital ltd 
kingsbridge  pursuant to which  through june   we may sell to kingsbridge up to approximately million shares of our common stock 
based on the closing market price of our common stock on march  we could realize proceeds from the sale of shares under our ceff of approximately million 
see  committed equity financing facility 
in addition  under our february atm program with stifel discussed below  we have the ability to sell up to  of common stock over a period of three years  at such times and in such amounts that we deem appropriate 
however  the atm program can be cancelled at any time by either us or stifel 
see  note subsequent events  to our consolidated financial statements 
we also may consider public and private equity offerings or other financing transactions  including potentially secured equipment financing facilities or other similar transactions 
to fund our long term development programs  we would prefer to enter into strategic alliances or collaboration agreements that could provide development and commercial expertise as well as financial resources potentially in the form of upfront payments  milestone payments  commercialization royalties and a sharing of research and development expenses and  if approved  the introduction of our approved products in various markets outside the us 
table of contents our future capital requirements depend upon many factors  primarily the success of our efforts to i execute the commercial introduction of surfaxin and afectair in the us as planned  ii advance the aerosurf development program to initiation of the planned phase clinical program in the fourth quarter of  and the surfaxin ls development program towards potential clinical trials  and iii secure one or more strategic alliances or other collaboration arrangements to a support the further development and  if approved  commercialization of aerosurf  and b to support the commercial introduction of surfaxin and afectair and  if approved  aerosurf and surfaxin ls  in markets outside the us we believe that our ability to successfully enter into meaningful strategic alliances has likely improved with receipt of marketing approval in the us for surfaxin and will further improve if we are able to initiate our aerosurf phase clinical program in the fourth quarter of and advance our surfaxin ls program towards initiation of clinical trials 
there can be no assurance  however  that our efforts will be successful  or that we will be able to obtain additional capital to support our activities when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
during the year ended december   we completed the following financing transactions o on march   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds to us after underwriter fees and anticipated expenses of approximately million 
o in march  we initiated an offering under our lazard atm program and issued  shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million  after deducting commissions due to the sales agent

as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
in february  we entered into a facility agreement deerfield facility with affiliates of deerfield management company  lp deerfield  pursuant to which deerfield agreed to loan to us up to million on a secured basis 
deerfield advanced million upon execution of the agreement and agreed to advance an additional million  subject to certain conditions  following the first commercial sale of surfaxin  provided that the first sale occurs not later than december  at the time of each disbursement  we agreed to pay deerfield a transaction fee equal to of the amount disbursed 
interest will accrue on the outstanding principal amount of the loan at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly in cash 
we have the right to prepay the loan at any time without penalty 
see  item a risk factors our existing and future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition  and in the event we are unable to meet our debt obligations  the lenders could foreclose on our assets  and even after completing our deerfield facility  we will need to obtain additional capital to successfully commercialize our approved products and develop our products under development  including aerosurf and surfaxin ls  and continue our other research and development programs 
in connection with the first disbursement  we issued to deerfield a warrant to purchase approximately million shares at an exercise price of  and in connection with the second disbursement  we have agreed to issue to deerfield a warrant to purchase approximately million shares at an exercise price of individually and collectively  the deerfield warrants 
also in february  we entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement stifel agreement with stifel  nicolaus company  incorporated stifel  pursuant to which stifel  as our exclusive agent  at our discretion and at such times that we determine from time to time  may sell over a three year period up to a maximum of  of shares of our common stock shares through an at the market program atm program 
we are not required to sell any shares at any time during the term of the atm program 
we will pay stifel a commission for each transaction equal to of the gross proceeds 

table of contents in addition  as of december   we had outstanding warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at various prices  exercisable on different dates into of these warrants  approximately million are february five year warrants that were issued at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants contain anti dilution provisions that adjust the exercise price if we issue any common stock  securities convertible into common stock  or other securities subject to certain exceptions at a value below the then existing exercise price of the warrants 
accordingly  the exercise price of these warrants was adjusted downward to per share following a public offering in march that we conducted at an offering price of per share 
as of december    of the february five year warrants were outstanding 
if the market price of our common stock should exceed at any time prior to the expiration date of these warrants february and if the holders determine in their discretion to exercise these warrants and we have an effective registration statement covering the warrant shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants  we potentially could raise up to an additional million 
the holders of the deerfield warrants may exercise the warrants either for cash or on a cashless basis 
in addition  in lieu of paying cash  the holders may elect to reduce the principal amount of the related loan to satisfy the exercise price of the warrants upon exercise 
if we issue the second deerfield warrant and if the holders determine in their discretion to exercise the deerfield warrants in a cash exercise instead of a cashless exercise  we potentially could raise up to an additional million 
although we believe that  in the future  we will secure additional capital from the exercise of at least a portion of our outstanding warrants  there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will equal or exceed price levels that make exercise of outstanding warrants likely or that holders of outstanding warrants will choose to exercise any or all of their warrants prior to the warrant expiration date 
moreover  if our outstanding warrants are exercised  such exercises likely will be at a discount to the then market value of our common stock and have a dilutive effect on the value of our shares of common stock at the time of exercise 
although we currently believe that we will be able to meet our strategic planning goals  there can be no assurance that we will be successful 
we require additional capital  either through strategic alliances or other financing transactions  to satisfy debt obligations and sustain operations  and to complete the development and support the commercial introduction of our products  including surfaxin  afectair  and  if approved  aerosurf and potentially surfaxin ls 
failure to secure the necessary additional capital would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
