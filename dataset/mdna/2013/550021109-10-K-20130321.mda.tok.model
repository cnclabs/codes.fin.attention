item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion summarizes our consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity during the three year period ending february  our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to january of the following year  typically resulting in a week year  but occasionally giving rise to an additional week  resulting in a week year 
fiscal is a week year 
net sales numbers include results from the rd week  however  comparable stores sales calculations exclude the rd week 
fiscal  and ended on february   january  and january   respectively 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions set forth in the special note regarding forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in the item a risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview our results for fiscal demonstrate the ongoing success of our efforts to execute the goals we set at the end of last year 
we committed to continued investment in our stores and our people  making infrastructure enhancements and funding working capital requirements  while remaining conscious of our discretionary spending 
these goals included driving store productivity along with north american store build out and ecommerce  seeding international markets via a community  showroom and ecommerce model  and reinvesting in product innovation to create value and differentiation in our product lines and to enhance our leadership position for the long term 
we continually assess the economic environment and market conditions when making decisions regarding timing of our investments 
our investments in our stores and people were reflected in our comparable stores net revenue growth  which leveraged our fixed operating costs 
we increased our store base through execution of our real estate strategy  when and where we saw opportunities for success 
for example  we opened new corporate owned stores in north america  australia  and new zealand since fiscal where we find opportunities for growth through opening showrooms  or other community presence efforts  we expect to expand our store base and therefore our business 
our growth strategy relies on positive comparable store sales and expansion in north america  particularly in the united states 
we have also determined that international growth is an opportunity and are expanding our foothold in markets by establishing local community connections  distributing to strategic sales partners and opening showrooms where we feel our key guests are shopping 
throughout fiscal  we were able to grow our e commerce business which has further increased our brand awareness and has made our product available in new markets  including those outside of north america 
this sales channel offers a higher operating margin than our other segments and accounted for of total revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to of total revenue in the same period of the prior year 
continuing increases in traffic and conversion rates on our e commerce website lead us to believe that there is potential for our direct to consumer segment to become an increasingly substantial part of our business and we plan to continue to commit a portion of our resources to further developing this channel 
in fiscal we launched country and region specific websites in australia  europe and asia to provide our online guests with local content  assortment and pricing 
in mid march  we determined that certain shipments of women s black luon bottoms received from our factories and available in our stores from march   did not meet our technical specifications 
as we became aware of this issue  we pulled what we believe to be all of the affected items from our stores  showrooms 
table of contents and e commerce sites and began working with our supplier to replace the fabric and with our other manufacturers to replace these items as quickly as possible 
the lost revenue  additional costs expected to be incurred and the write down of affected product on hand from this issue will negatively impact our results from operations in fiscal we believe that our brand is recognized as premium in our offerings of run and yoga assortment  as well as a leader in technical fabrics and functionality 
this has made our product desirable to our consumers and has driven demand  which we are able to meet given our increased product depth compared to last year 
delivering quality to our customers is a critical factor in our market place differentiation and removing items that do not meet our standards is key to maintaining our brand reputation 
in fiscal  we plan on investing in new and legacy information technology systems to develop new capabilities in our vertical retail strategy 
we have recently added strong leadership in quality control  our liason office and our commercialization and development teams  and expect these people and other investments to solidify our quality consistency and our delivery capabilities 
we believe our strong cash flow generation  solid balance sheet and healthy liquidity provide us with the financial flexibility to continue executing the initiatives which we believe will lead to quality growth 
operating segment overview lululemon is a designer and retailer of technical athletic apparel operating primarily in north america and australia 
our yoga inspired apparel is marketed under the lululemon athletica and ivivva athletica brand names 
we offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories including fitness pants  shorts  tops and jackets designed for athletic pursuits such as yoga  running and general fitness  and dance inspired apparel for female youth 
as of february   our branded apparel was principally sold through corporate owned stores that are located in the united states  canada  australia and new zealand and via our e commerce websites through our direct to consumer sales channel 
we believe our vertical retail strategy allows us to interact more directly with and gain insights from our customers while providing us with greater control of our brand 
in fiscal  of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in the united states  of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in canada and of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of north america 
in fiscal  of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in the united states  of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in canada and of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of north america 
in fiscal  of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products in the united states  of our net revenue was derived from the sales of our products in canada and of our net revenue was derived from sales of our products outside of north america 
our net revenue increased from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal  representing a increase 
our increase in net revenue from fiscal to fiscal resulted from the addition of retail locations  and comparable store sales growth of in fiscal  excluding the impact of the rd week 
our ability to open new stores and grow sales in existing stores has been driven by increasing demand for our technical athletic apparel and a growing recognition of the lululemon athletica brand 
we believe our superior products  strategic store locations  inviting store environment  grassroots marketing approach and distinctive corporate culture are responsible for our strong financial performance 
we have three reportable segments corporate owned stores  direct to consumer and other 
we report our segments based on the financial information we use in managing our businesses 
while we receive financial information for each corporate owned store  we have aggregated all of the corporate owned stores into one reportable segment due to the similarities in the economic and other characteristics of these stores 
our corporate owned stores segment accounted for of our net revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal our direct to consumer segment accounted for of our net revenue in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal our other segment  consisting of franchise sales  wholesale accounts  sales from company operated showrooms  warehouse sales and outlets  each accounted for less than of our net revenue in each of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we previously reported our franchise channel as an operating segment  however  we reacquired our remaining four franchised stores in fiscal and opening new franchise stores is not part of our growth strategy 

table of contents as of february   we sold our products through corporate owned stores located in  the united states  canada  australia  and new zealand 
we plan to increase our net revenue in north america and australia by opening additional corporate owned stores in new and existing markets 
corporate owned stores accounted for of total net revenue in fiscal  of total net revenue in fiscal and of total net revenue in fiscal as of february   our direct to consumer segment included our lululemon and ivivva e commerce websites 
e commerce sales are taken directly from retail customers through www 
lululemon 
com and www 
ivivva 
com and other country and region specific websites 
our direct to consumer segment is an increasingly substantial part of our growth strategy  and now represents of our net revenue 
in addition to deriving revenue from sales through our corporate owned stores and direct to consumer  we also derive other net revenue  which includes wholesale customers  as well as warehouse sales and sales through a number of company operated showrooms and temporary locations 
wholesale customers include select premium yoga studios  health clubs and fitness centers 
warehouse sales are typically held one or more times a year to sell slow moving inventory or inventory from prior seasons to retail customers at discounted prices 
our showrooms are typically small locations that we open from time to time when we enter new markets and feature a limited selection of our product offering during select hours 
our temporary locations are typically opened for the holiday season in markets in which we may not already have a presence 
we reacquired our four remaining franchise stores during fiscal  and as such  franchise sales  which included inventory sales and royalties  are no longer a part of our other net revenue 
other net revenue accounted for of total revenue in fiscal  of total net revenue in fiscal and of total net revenue in fiscal we believe that our athletic apparel has and will continue to appeal to consumers outside of north america who value its technical attributes as well as its function and style 
in  we opened our first store in australia which was operated under a franchise license 
in fiscal we made a equity investment in lululemon athletica australia pty  our franchise operator 
during fiscal we increased our investment to which provided us with control over lululemon athletica australia pty 
during fiscal we purchased the remaining non controlling interest in lululemon athletica australia pty 
in fiscal  we opened our first company operated showroom in hong kong and in fiscal we opened our first company operated showroom in the united kingdom 
basis of presentation net revenue is comprised of corporate owned store net revenue  which includes sales to customers through corporate owned stores in north america and australia  direct to consumer revenue  which includes sales from our e commerce websites  and other net revenue  which includes wholesale accounts  franchises net revenue  which consists of royalties as well as sales of our products to franchises  warehouse sales  outlets and sales from company operated showrooms 
in each case  net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts 
in addition  we separately track comparable store sales  which reflect net revenue at corporate owned stores that have been open for at least months 
therefore  net revenue from a store is included in comparable store sales beginning with the first month for which the store has a full month of comparable prior year sales 
non comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not been open or otherwise not operated by us for months or from stores which have been significantly remodeled or relocated 
also included in non comparable stores sales are sales from direct to consumer sales  wholesale  franchises  warehouse sales and 
table of contents showrooms  and sales from corporate owned stores which we have closed 
the rd week of fiscal is excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales 
by measuring the change in year over year net revenue in stores that have been open for months or more  comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our core store base is performing 
various factors affect comparable store sales  including the location of new stores relative to existing stores  consumer preferences  buying trends and overall economic trends  our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to customer preferences for technical athletic apparel  competition  changes in our merchandise mix  pricing  the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events  the effectiveness of our grassroots marketing efforts  the level of customer service that we provide in our stores  our ability to source and distribute products efficiently  and the number of stores we open  close including for temporary renovations and expand in any period 
opening new stores is an important part of our growth strategy 
accordingly  comparable store sales has limited utility for assessing the success of our growth strategy insofar as comparable store sales do not reflect the performance of stores open less than months 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of purchased merchandise  which includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor  as applicable  the cost incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight  non refundable taxes  duty and other landing costs  the cost of our distribution centers such as labor  rent and utilities and the depreciation and amortization related to our distribution centers  the cost of our production  merchandise and design departments including salaries  stock based compensation and benefits  and operating expenses  the cost of occupancy related to store operations such as rent and utilities and the depreciation and amortization related to store level capital expenditures  hemming  and shrink and valuation reserves 
cost of goods sold also may change as we open or close stores because of the resulting change in related occupancy costs 
the primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of all operating costs not otherwise included in cost of goods sold 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include marketing costs  accounting costs  information technology costs  human resource costs  professional fees  corporate facility costs  corporate and 
table of contents store level payroll and benefits expenses  stock based compensation and occupancy  depreciation and amortization expense for all assets other than depreciation and amortization expenses related to store level capital expenditures and our distribution centers  each of which are included in cost of goods sold 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars due to anticipated continued growth of our corporate support staff and store level employees 
other income expense  net includes interest earned on our cash balances and our advances to franchise  interest costs associated with our credit facilities and with letters of credit drawn under these facilities for the purchase of merchandise and our share of the operations of our investment in lululemon athletica australia pty prior to obtaining control in fiscal  including the remeasurement of our investment immediately before obtaining control of the business 
we expect to continue to generate interest income to the extent that our cash generated from operations exceeds our cash used for investment 
we have maintained relatively small outstanding balances on our credit facilities and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
provision for income taxes depends on the statutory tax rates in the countries where we sell our products 
historically we had generated taxable income in canada and we had generated tax losses in the united states 
in fiscal we earned taxable income in the united states and fully utilized any net operating losses available from prior periods 
we anticipate continued growth in the united states and consequently foresee an increase in taxable income reported 
we have recorded deferred tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences of million 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was lower than the effective rate for fiscal due primarily to the ongoing impact of revised intercompany pricing agreements 
our effective tax rate in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal we anticipate that in the future we may start to sell our products directly to some customers located outside of canada  the united states  the united kingdom  hong kong  australia and new zealand  in which case we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales take place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly

despite the fact that we have experienced a significant amount of our net revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  we believe that the true extent of the seasonality or cyclical nature of our business may have been overshadowed by our rapid growth to date 
as our expected growth rate slows  we believe that we will experience fourth quarter gross profits as a percentage of full year gross profits as high  or higher  than in the current year 

table of contents the level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business 
we expect inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses to be higher in the third and fourth quarters in preparation for the holiday selling season 
because our products are sold primarily through our stores  order backlog is not material to our business 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are our current balances of cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility 
our primary cash needs are capital expenditures for opening new stores and remodeling existing stores  making information technology system enhancements and funding working capital requirements 
cash and cash equivalents in excess of our needs are held in interest bearing accounts with financial institutions 
as of february   our working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents was million and our cash and cash equivalents were million 
the following table summarizes our net cash flows provided by and used in operating  investing and financing activities for the periods indicated fiscal year ended february  january  january  in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  realized gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment  stock based compensation expense and the effect of the changes in non cash working capital items  principally accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities increased million  to million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the increase was primarily a result of increased net income  an increase in items not affecting cash  and an increase in income taxes payable  offset by decreased accounts payable 
the net increase in items not affecting cash was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization related to our increased store base  and an increase in stock based compensation 
depreciation and amortization relate almost entirely to leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  computer hardware and software  equipment and vehicles in our stores and other corporate buildings 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal depreciation for our corporate owned store segment was million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
depreciation for our direct to consumer segment was million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
depreciation related to corporate activities was million  million  and million fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we have not allocated any depreciation to our other segment as these amounts to date have been immaterial 

table of contents investing activities investing activities relate entirely to capital expenditures and acquisitions of franchises 
cash used in investing activities decreased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal capital expenditures for our corporate owned stores segment were million in fiscal which included million to open corporate owned stores and million to purchase the land and buildings of two of our corporate owned stores  and million in fiscal which included million to open corporate owned stores 
the remaining capital expenditures for our corporate owned stores segment in each period were for ongoing store refurbishment 
capital expenditures for our direct to consumer segment were million and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures related to corporate activities and administration compared to fiscal was primarily due to the purchase of our principal executive and administrative offices for million plus acquisition related costs in fiscal the capital expenditures in each period for corporate activities and administration were for improvements at our head office and other corporate buildings as well as investments in information technology and business systems 
capital expenditures are expected to range between million to million in fiscal  including approximately million for approximately new stores and the remainder reflecting renovation capital for existing stores  information technology enhancements and other corporate activities 
financing activities financing activities consist primarily of cash received on the exercise of stock options  excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and cash paid to acquire the remaining non controlling interest in australia 
cash provided by financing activities decreased million  to cash used of million in fiscal from cash provided of million in fiscal the cash used in financing activities for fiscal included million for the purchase of the non controlling interest in lululemon australia 
we believe that our cash from operations and borrowings available to us under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
our cash from operations may be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products as well as the other factors described in risk factors 
in addition  we may make discretionary capital improvements with respect to our stores  distribution facilities  headquarters  or other systems  which we would expect to fund through the issuance of debt or equity securities or other external financing sources to the extent we were unable to fund such capital expenditures out of our cash from operations 
revolving credit facility in april  we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with royal bank of canada 
the revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to cdn million 
the revolving credit facility must be repaid in full on demand and is available by way of prime loans in canadian currency  us base rate loans in us currency  bankers acceptances  libor based loans in us currency or euro currency  letters of credit in canadian currency or us currency and letters of guaranty in canadian currency or us currency 
the revolving credit facility bears interest on the outstanding balance in accordance with the following i prime rate for prime loans  ii us base rate for us based loans  iii a fee of per annum on bankers acceptances  iv libor plus per annum for libor based loans  v a annual fee for letters of credit  and vi a annual fee for letters of guaranty 
both lululemon usa inc 
and lululemon fc usa inc  inc provided royal bank of canada with guarantees and postponements of claims in the amounts of cdn million with respect to lululemon athletica canada inc 
s obligations under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is also secured by all of our present 
table of contents and after acquired personal property  including all intellectual property and all of the outstanding shares we own in our subsidiaries 
as of february   aside from the letters of credit and guarantees  we had nil in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
contractual obligations and commitments leases 
we lease certain corporate owned store locations  storage spaces  building and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
our leases generally have initial terms of between five and years  and generally can be extended only in five year increments  if at all 
our leases expire at various dates between one and years  excluding extensions at our option 
a substantial number of our leases for corporate owned store premises include renewal options and certain of our leases include rent escalation clauses  rent holidays and leasehold rental incentives  none of which are reflected in the following table 
most of our leases for corporate owned store premises also include contingent rental payments based on sales volume  the impact of which also are not reflected in the following table 
the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements as of february   and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by fiscal year total thereafter in thousands operating leases minimum rent off balance sheet arrangements we enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate the international purchase of merchandise 
we also enter into standby letters of credit to secure certain of our obligations  including insurance programs and duties related to import purchases 
as of february   letters of credit and letters of guarantee totaling million have been issued 
other than these standby letters of credit  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
in addition  we have not entered into any derivative contracts or synthetic leases 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and  as such  requires the use of judgment 
actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
net revenue is comprised of corporate owned store net revenue  direct to consumer sales through www 
lululemon 
com  www 
ivivva 
com and other country and region specific websites  and other net revenue  which includes  franchise royalties as well as sales of products to franchisees  sales to wholesale accounts  warehouse sales and sales from company operated showrooms  in each case  net of an estimated allowance for sales returns and discounts 
sales to customers through corporate owned stores and company operated showrooms are recognized at the point of sale  net of an estimated allowance for sales returns 
direct to consumer sales are recognized when goods are shipped and collection is reasonably assured  net of an estimated 
table of contents allowance for sales returns 
other net revenue related to franchise royalties are recognized when earned  in accordance with the terms of the franchise license agreements 
royalties are based on a percentage of the franchisees sales and recognized when those sales occur 
other net revenue related to warehouse sales is recognized when these sales occur 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recognized at the time of shipment 
sales are reported on a net revenue basis  which is computed by deducting from our gross sales the amount of sales taxes  actual product returns received  discounts and an amount established for anticipated sales returns 
our estimated allowance for sales returns is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net revenue 
this allowance is calculated based on a history of actual returns  estimated future returns and any significant future known or anticipated events 
consideration of these factors results in an estimated allowance for sales returns 
our standard terms for retail sales limit returns to approximately days after the sale of the merchandise 
for our wholesale sales  we allow returns from our wholesale customers if properly requested and approved 
employee discounts are classified as a reduction of net revenue 
revenue from our gift cards are recognized when tendered for payment  or upon redemption 
outstanding customer balances are included in unredeemed gift card liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
there are no expiration dates on our gift cards  and lululemon does not charge any service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances 
while we will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment  management may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to  among other things  long periods of inactivity 
in these circumstances  to the extent management determines there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws  card balances may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in net revenue 
inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost and market 
cost is determined using weighted average costs 
for finished goods  market is defined as net realizable value  and for raw materials  market is defined as replacement cost 
cost of inventories includes acquisition and production costs including raw material and labor  as applicable  and all costs incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution centers including freight  non refundable taxes  duty and other landing costs 
we periodically review our inventories and make provisions as necessary to appropriately value obsolete or damaged goods 
the amount of the provision is equal to the difference between the book cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demands  selling prices and market conditions 
in addition  as part of inventory valuations  we provide for inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from actual physical inventories 
inventory shrinkage estimates are made to reduce the inventory value for lost or stolen items 
we perform physical inventory counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly 
in fiscal  we wrote off million of inventory and in fiscal we wrote off million of inventory 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
direct internal and external costs related to software used for internal purposes which are incurred during the application development stage or for upgrades that add functionality are capitalized 
all other costs related to internal use software are expensed as incurred 
buildings are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of the asset  which ranges from to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the length of the lease  without consideration of option renewal periods and the estimated useful life of the assets  up to a maximum of five years 
all other property and equipment are amortized using the declining balance method as follows furniture and fixtures computer hardware and software equipment and vehicles 
table of contents we recognize a liability for the fair value of a required asset retirement obligation  or aro  when such obligation is incurred 
our aros are primarily associated with leasehold improvements which  at the end of a lease  we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement 
at the inception of a lease with such conditions  we record an aro liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation 
the liability is estimated based on a number of assumptions requiring management s judgment  including store closing costs  cost inflation rates and discount rates  and is accreted to its projected future value over time 
the capitalized asset is depreciated using the convention for depreciation of leasehold improvement assets 
upon satisfaction of the aro conditions  any difference between the recorded aro liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as an operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
we recognize a liability for a cost associated with a lease exit activity when such obligation is incurred 
a lease exit activity is measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
we estimate fair value at the cease use date of its operating leases as the remaining lease rentals  reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property  even where we does not intend to enter into a sublease 
estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions  including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income 
the estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate 
lease exit costs are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs 
long lived assets 
long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite useful lives  held for use are evaluated for impairment when the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable as measured by comparing their net book value to the estimated future cash flows generated by their use and eventual disposition 
impaired assets are recorded at fair value  determined principally by the estimated future cash flows expected from their use and eventual disposition 
reductions in asset values resulting from impairment valuations are recognized in income in the period that the impairment is determined 
long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite useful lives  held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying value of the asset and fair value less cost to sell 
any write downs to reflect fair value less selling cost is recognized in income when the asset is classified as held for sale 
gains or losses on assets held for sale and asset dispositions are included in provision for impairment and lease exit costs 
income taxes 
we follow the liability method with respect to accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when these differences are anticipated to reverse 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recognition of a deferred income tax asset is based upon several assumptions and management forecasts  including current and proposed tax legislation  current and anticipated taxable income  utilization of previously unrealized non operating loss carry forwards and regulatory reviews of tax filings 
given the judgments and estimates required and the sensitivity of the results to the significant assumptions used  we believe the accounting estimates used in relation to the recognition of deferred income tax assets are subject to measurement uncertainty and are susceptible to a material change if the underlying assumptions change 
for financial reporting purposes  we generally provide taxes at the rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdiction 
because our present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in our foreign operations  we do not provide us income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
management periodically assesses the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance our foreign operations 
this assessment is based on cash flow projections that are the result of estimates of future production  fiscal requirements by tax jurisdiction of our operations and operational and fiscal objectives by tax jurisdiction for our operations 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future 

table of contents we file income tax returns in the united states  canada and various foreign and state jurisdictions 
the and tax years remain subject to examination by the us federal and state tax authorities 
the tax year is still open for certain state tax authorities 
the to tax years remain subject to examination by tax authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions 
our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as a selling  general and administrative expense 
at february   we do not have any significant accruals for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits or tax penalties 
our intercompany transfer pricing policies are currently subject to audits by various foreign tax jurisdictions 
although we believe that our intercompany transfer pricing policies and tax positions are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits or potential tax disputes may be materially different from that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 
goodwill and intangible assets 
intangible assets are recorded at cost 
non competition agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life of five years 
reacquired franchise rights are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of years 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired and is not amortized 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently when an event or circumstance indicates that goodwill or indefinite useful live intangible assets might be impaired 
we use our best estimates and judgment based on available evidence in conducting the impairment testing 
when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair market value 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation using the fair value method 
the fair value of awards granted is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period with the offsetting credit to additional paid in capital 
our calculation of stock based compensation requires us to make a number of complex and subjective estimates and assumptions  including future forfeitures  stock price volatility  expected life of the options and related tax effects 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider several factors when estimating expected forfeitures  such as types of awards  size of option holder group and anticipated employee retention 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
expected volatility of the stock is based on our review of companies we believe of similar growth and maturity and our peer group in the industry in which we do business because we do not have sufficient historical volatility data for our own stock 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
in the future  as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock and the actual term employees hold our options  expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and  ultimately  the expense we record 
for awards with service and or performance conditions  the total amount of compensation expense to be recognized is based on the number of awards that are expected to vest and is adjusted to reflect those awards that do ultimately vest 
for awards with performance conditions  we recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period as determined by a range of probability weighted outcomes 
for awards with market and or performance conditions  all compensation expense is recognized if it is probable that the underlying market or performance conditions will be fulfilled 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we currently generate a significant portion of our net revenue in canada 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar 
historically  our operations were based largely in canada 
as of february   we operated stores in canada 
as a result  we have been impacted by changes in exchange rates and may be impacted materially for the foreseeable future 
as we recognize net revenue from sales in canada in canadian dollars  and the us dollar has strengthened during fiscal  it has had a negative impact on our canadian operating results upon translation of those results into us dollars for the purposes of consolidation 
however  the loss in net revenue was partially offset by lower cost of sales and lower selling  general and administrative expenses that are generated in canadian dollars 
a depreciation in the relative value of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal to the extent the ratio between our net revenue generated in canadian dollars increases as compared to our expenses generated in canadian dollars  we expect that our results of operations will be further impacted by changes in exchange rates 
a portion of our net revenue is generated in australia 
a depreciation in the relative value of the australian dollar compared to the us dollar would have resulted in lost income from operations of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal we do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations 
however  in the future  in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks  we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments  although we have not historically done so 
we do not  and do not intend to  engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit 
interest rate risk 
in april  we entered into an uncommitted senior secured demand revolving credit facility with royal bank of canada 
the revolving credit facility provides us with available borrowings in an amount up to cdn million 
because our revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  we will be exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates  if we have a meaningful outstanding balance 
as of february   we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility 
we had small outstanding balances under our revolving facility during fiscal as we built inventory and working capital for the holiday selling season  but we do not believe we are significantly exposed to changes in interest rate risk 
we currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future 
however  in the future  if we have a meaningful outstanding balance under our revolving facility  in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks  we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments  although we have not historically done so 
these may take the form of forward sales contracts  option contracts  and interest rate swaps 
we do not  and do not intend to  engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs
