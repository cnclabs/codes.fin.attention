critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our sales  income or loss from operations and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of sales  expenses and significant estimates and judgments applied by management 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition  accounting for income taxes  valuation and evaluating impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  and valuation of inventory 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed  acceptance by the customer is reasonably certain and collection is probable 
this generally occurs upon shipment of product to the customer 
sales of the company s products are subject to limited warranty obligations that are included in the company s terms and conditions 
also  the company offers limited discounts and rebates to customers which are recorded in net sales on an estimated basis as the sales are incurred 
the company records freight revenues billed to customers as revenue and the related shipping and handling cost in cost of sales 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  income taxes  under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results  or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recorded valuation allowance is based on significant estimates and judgments and if the facts and circumstances change the valuation allowance could materially change 
in accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of september   the company had us federal and state net operating loss nol carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the us federal nol carry forward amounts expire in fiscal years through if not utilized 
the state nol carry forward amounts expire in fiscal years through if not utilized 
in fiscal year  the company completed an internal revenue code section analysis of the loss carry forwards and determined that all of the company s loss carry forwards were utilizable and not restricted under section the company has not updated its section analysis subsequent to and does not believe there have been any events subsequent to that would impact the analysis 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that these deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not or unknown  we must establish a valuation allowance 
if the valuation allowance is reduced  the company would record an income tax benefit in the period in which that determination is made 
if the valuation allowance is increased  the company would record additional income tax expense 
during the fourth quarter of  the company reversed a portion of its remaining valuation allowance in consideration of all available positive and negative evidence  including our historical operating results  current financial condition  and potential future taxable income 
the reduction in the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year resulted in a non cash income tax benefit of  as a result  we recorded an income tax benefit of  for the year ended september  compared to income tax expense of  for the year ended september  as of september   the company s only remaining valuation allowance of approximately  relates to state net operating loss carry forwards we do not expect to utilize 
the company will continue to assess the assumptions used to determine the amount of our valuation allowance and may adjust the valuation allowance in future periods based on changes in assumptions of estimated future income and other factors 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and various state jurisdictions 
based on its evaluation  the company has concluded that it has no significant unrecognized tax benefits 
with limited exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal and state income tax examinations for fiscal years ending prior to we are generally subject to us federal and state tax examinations for all tax years since due to our net operating loss carryforwards and the utilization of the carryforwards in years still open under statute 
in  the company changed its fiscal year from march to september impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company s long lived assets at september  consisted of property  plant and equipment  patents and goodwill 
the company reviews the carrying amount of its property  plant and equipment and patents if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
when this review indicates the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  the company recognizes an asset impairment charge against operations for the amount by which the carrying amount of the impaired asset exceeds its fair value 
determining fair values of property  plant and equipment and patents using a discounted cash flow method involves significant judgment and requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends  consultations with external valuation specialists and other information 
if facts and circumstances change  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in a materially different outcome 
the company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  and estimated expansion of the fttp market 
the company operates as one reporting unit and reviews the carrying amount of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the company determines its fair value for goodwill impairment testing purposes by calculating its market capitalization and comparing that to the company s carrying value 
the company s goodwill impairment test for the years ended september  and resulted in excess fair value over carrying value and therefore  no adjustments were made to goodwill 
during the year ended september   there were no triggering events that indicated goodwill could be impaired 
a significant reduction in our market capitalization or in the carrying amount of net assets of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company would measure the possible goodwill impairment loss based on an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be based on significant estimates and judgments  and if the facts and circumstances change  a potential impairment could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
no impairment of long lived assets or goodwill has occurred during the years ended september  or  respectively 
valuation of inventory the company maintains a material amount of inventory to support its manufacturing operations and customer demand 
this inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
on a regular basis  the company reviews its inventory and identifies that which is excess  slow moving and obsolete by considering factors such as inventory levels  expected product life and forecasted sales demand 
any identified excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its market value through a charge to cost of sales 
it is possible that additional inventory write down charges may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for the company s products and the company does not adjust its manufacturing production accordingly 
results of operations year ended september  compared to year ended september  net sales for the fiscal year increased to  from net sales of  in sales growth was experienced from existing clients as well as from the development of new accounts within the telecommunications industry 
the growth in sales includes gains from within tier carriers  an emerging presence associated with tier carriers who have a national footprint  cable providers as well as non traditional providers who are entering the us market 
the company also recorded a growing percentage of its sales from accounts outside of the us  principally canada and the caribbean regions of central america 
as a result of the above factors  sales in fiscal year to commercial data networks and broadband service providers were of net sales  or  while sales associated with build to print manufacturing for original equipment manufacturers outside of the telecommunications market were of net sales  or  for fiscal year  sales to commercial data networks and broadband service providers were of net sales  or  while sales associated with build to print manufacturing for original equipment manufacturers outside of the telecommunications market were of net sales  or  cost of sales for the fiscal year was  an increase of  or from the  in fiscal year gross margin was in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year gross profit increased  or  from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year the year over year increase in cost of goods and gross profit is a result of increased net sales 
the increase in gross profit percentage is the result of increasing volumes  operating efficiencies and product mix 
selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal year was  up compared to  for fiscal year this increase is primarily composed of  in higher commission and performance compensation accruals associated with higher net sales 
additionally  equity compensation expense increased  due to a higher number of equity awards outstanding  and product development costs increased  income from operations for fiscal year was  compared to  for fiscal year this increase is due to continued product acceptance across both existing clients and new accounts that drove increased net sales in fiscal year interest income in fiscal year was  compared to  for the fiscal year the decrease is a result of declining interest rates resulting in lower returns on our investments 
the company invests its excess cash primarily in fdic backed bank certificates of deposit and money market accounts 
income tax expense for fiscal year was  income tax for fiscal year was a benefit of  our current year provision for income taxes includes estimated federal alternative minimum taxes  state income and franchise taxes but is primarily a result of deferred tax expense resulting from nol utilization 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company reversed a substantial portion of the remaining valuation allowance of the deferred tax assets in the amount of  increasing our net income by that amount as well and contributing per diluted share for the period 
net income for fiscal year was  or per share for basic and for diluted  compared to  or per basic and per diluted share for the year the decrease in net income was primarily due to the reversal of a portion of the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of september   our principal source of liquidity was our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
those sources total  at september   compared to  at september  our excess cash is invested mainly in certificates of deposit backed by the fdic and money market accounts 
substantially all of our funds are insured by the fdic 
investments considered long term are  at september   compared to  at september  we believe the combined balances of short term cash and investments along with long term investments provide a more accurate indication of our available liquidity
