item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business redwood is an internally managed operating company focused on engaging in residential and commercial mortgage banking activities and investing in mortgage and other real estate related assets 
we seek to generate fee and gain on sale income through our mortgage banking activities and to invest in real estate related assets that have the potential to generate attractive cash flow returns over time 
for tax purposes  redwood trust  inc is structured as a real estate investment trust reit and we generally refer  collectively  to redwood trust  inc and those of its subsidiaries that are not subject to subsidiary level corporate income tax as the reit or our reit 
we generally refer to subsidiaries of redwood trust  inc that are subject to subsidiary level corporate income tax as our operating subsidiaries or our taxable reit subsidiaries 
our mortgage banking activities are generally carried out through our operating subsidiaries  while our portfolio of mortgage and other real estate related investments is primarily held at our reit 
we generally intend to retain profits generated and taxed at our operating subsidiaries  and to distribute as dividends at least of the income we generate from the investment portfolio at our reit 
our residential mortgage banking activities primarily consist of operating a residential mortgage loan conduit ie  the acquisition of residential mortgage loans  which we also refer to as residential loans  from third party originators and the subsequent sale or securitization of those loans 
most of the residential loans we acquire are securitized through our sequoia securitization program 
the process of sponsoring a sequoia securitization begins with the acquisition  on a loan by loan basis or flow basis  of residential loans originated by banks and mortgage companies located throughout the us  periodically augmented by our acquisition of larger pools of residential loans or bulk acquisitions that may be available for purchase from other participants in the capital markets for residential loan finance 
our acquisition and accumulation of these loans for securitization is generally funded with equity and short term debt 
once a sufficient amount of residential loans has been accumulated for securitization  we pool and transfer those loans to a sequoia securitization entity  establish a financial structure for the securitization  and the sequoia securitization entity then issues senior and subordinate residential mortgage backed securities rmbs or residential securities collateralized by that pool of loans 
senior securities issued by sequoia securitization entities  or those interests that generally have the first right to cash flows and are generally last to absorb losses  are generally issued to third parties we refer to as senior investors or triple a investors  while some or all of the remaining subordinate securities  or those interests that generally have the last right to cash flows and are generally first in line to absorb losses  are generally retained by us and held for investment at our reit 
from time to time we may also invest in senior interest only io securities issued by a sequoia securitization entity 
these io securities receive interest payments but no principal payments related to securitized residential mortgage loans 
we may also retain mortgage servicing rights msrs associated with residential loans transferred to a sequoia securitization entity 
the owner of an msr is entitled to receive a portion of the interest payments from the associated residential loan and is obligated to directly service  or retain a sub servicer to directly service  the associated loan 
the msr owner may also be obligated to fund advances of principal and interest payments due to a third party owner of the loan including  for example  a securitization trust  but not received on schedule from the loan borrower 
we do not originate or directly service residential loans 
residential loans for which we own the msr are directly serviced by a sub servicer we retain 
our commercial mortgage banking activities primarily consist of operating as a commercial real estate lender by originating mortgage loans and providing other forms of commercial real estate financing which we also refer to generally as commercial loans directly to borrowers and through a correspondent network of third party brokers 
we may structure commercial loans as senior or subordinate mortgage loans  as mezzanine loans  or as other forms of financing  such as preferred equity interests in special purpose entities that own commercial real estate 
we typically sell the senior loans we originate to other participants in the capital markets for commercial real estate finance  primarily to third party sponsors of commercial loan securitization entities that issue commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs or commercial securities 
the mezzanine and subordinate commercial loans we originate are generally transferred to  and held for investment at  our reit 
our investment portfolio is primarily held at our reit  and includes investments in residential securities issued in our sequoia securitization transactions  as well as residential securities issued by third parties 
some of the securities we invest in are residential re remic support securities or similar securities  which are securities that are generally created through the resecuritization of senior rmbs 
re remic support securities are subordinate to  and provide credit support for  the senior re remic securities issued in a resecuritization 
we may also invest in other assets  securities  and instruments that are related to residential real estate 
for example  in addition to investing in msrs associated with residential loans transferred to sequoia securitization entities  we may also invest in msrs acquired directly from third parties 
our investment portfolio includes investments in commercial loans that are originated 
table of contents through our commercial mortgage banking activities and may also include investments in cmbs or other forms of commercial real estate financing originated by others 
we assume a range of risks in our investments and the level of risk is influenced by  among other factors  the manner in which we finance our purchases of  and derive income from  our investments 
our primary sources of income are net interest income from our investment portfolio and income from our mortgage banking activities 
net interest income consists of the interest income we earn less the interest expenses we incur on borrowed funds and other liabilities 
mortgage banking income consists of  among other things  the fee and gain on sale income we generate through our residential and commercial mortgage banking activities  offset by hedging costs directly associated with engaging in these activities 
throughout our history we have sponsored or managed other investment entities  including a private limited partnership fund that we managed  the redwood opportunity fund  lp the fund  as well as acacia securitization entities  certain of which we continue to manage 
the fund was primarily invested in residential securities and the acacia entities are primarily invested in a variety of real estate related assets 
we are not currently seeking to sponsor or manage other entities like the fund or the acacia securitization entities 
during the third quarter of  we engaged in a transaction in which we resecuritized a pool of senior residential securities the residential resecuritization primarily for the purpose of obtaining permanent non recourse financing on a portion the residential securities we hold in our investment portfolio at the reit 
similarly  during the fourth quarter of  we engaged in a transaction in which we securitized a pool of commercial loans the commercial securitization primarily for the purpose of obtaining permanent non recourse financing on a portion of the commercial loans we hold in our investment portfolio at the reit 
many of the entities we have sponsored or managed are currently  or have been historically  recorded on our consolidated balance sheets for financial reporting purposes based upon applicable accounting guidance set forth by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
however  each of these entities is independent of redwood and of each other and the assets and liabilities of these entities are not  respectively  owned by us or legal obligations of ours  although we are exposed to certain financial risks associated with our role as the sponsor or manager of these entities and  to the extent we hold securities issued by  or other investments in  these entities  we are exposed to the performance of these entities and the assets they hold 
our strategy as the financial world engaged in broad based deleveraging following the onset of the financial crisis in  we made a strategic decision in late to invest in and build out our residential and commercial mortgage banking platforms 
we did this with the intent of positioning ourselves to manufacture our own steady sources of attractive mortgage and other real estate related investments and engage in activities that would provide us with repeatable gain on sale and fee income 
there is commonality between our residential and commercial business activities 
in both cases  we have established ourselves as an intermediary between borrowers and senior investors in the capital markets 
this strategy works well with the structure of our balance sheet and the talents and extensive relationships of the professionals who make up our residential and commercial teams 
our residential mortgage banking platform has evolved substantially since the financial crisis began 
during the pre credit crisis period  we were primarily focused on bulk acquisitions of residential loans as a buyer in the competitive auction process 
since mid  our focus has been to acquire prime  jumbo residential loans on a flow basis for the subsequent securitization of those loans  and to a lesser extent  for sale to third parties 
aside from the lack of any material bulk sale activity of newly originated jumbo residential loans  this evolution was  in part  due to our desire to build a franchise value producing business model that would be prepared to capitalize on the expected eventual reform of fannie mae and freddie mac the agencies and our desire to be competitive in the post financial crisis era of greater regulatory and capital requirements for all mortgage market participants  particularly for the more heavily regulated banks 
while the initial market opportunity appeared small  our confidence was driven by three primary business assumptions i that the us government would eventually reduce its outsized role in the mortgage market  ii that new bank regulation  including pending basel iii capital requirements  and legacy bank portfolio issues would open up an opportunity for independent mortgage companies like ours  and iii that traditional triple a investors ie  institutional investors that invest in triple a rated securities created through private label securitizations  such as sequoia securitizations would return to the securitization market to provide attractive financing for prime residential loans 

table of contents we believe that our three primary business assumptions are beginning to play out 
the federal housing finance agency fhfa  which regulates and is the conservator of fannie mae and freddie mac  has begun to raise the fees that the agencies are required to charge loan originators that sell them residential loans  which allows us and other sponsors of private label securitizations to become more competitive with the agencies in acquiring residential loans 
new bank regulations and pending basel iii capital requirements are forcing the major banks to rethink the ways in which they participate in the residential mortgage origination and financing markets and are causing msrs to change hands at attractive prices 
meanwhile  demand by triple a investors for senior securities issued through our sequoia securitization program has been strong since we restarted our residential loan securitization activity in we continue to maintain a complete residential mortgage banking team  with a skill set in underwriting  compliance  quality control  secondary marketing  and warehousing  to execute our residential mortgage banking activities 
our commercial mortgage banking platform was developed to capitalize on an inevitable wave of commercial loan refinancing demand  brought about by the pre financial crisis era of high leverage commercial real estate lending 
we identified an immediate market need for mezzanine and subordinate financing that could address the gap between commercial borrowers funding needs and what traditional senior commercial mortgage lenders would provide in a deleveraged business environment 
we also assumed that we would eventually position our platform to become an originator of senior commercial loans  offering value through greater flexibility and certainty of execution for borrowers 
we have made progress in both areas  as we have originated more than million of mezzanine and subordinate commercial loans since late  and are now originating senior commercial loans for sale through the capital markets for commercial real estate finance 
business update fourth quarter we continued to execute on our residential and commercial strategies in we believe we are only at the beginning stages of the build out of our mortgage banking platforms  but are now experiencing tangible financial results after three years of investment into our residential and commercial loan platforms 
we plan to continue to execute and utilize our positions in residential and commercial mortgage banking as a foundation for growth and shareholder value creation 
an important distinction between redwood and many other reits is our management compensation structure 
we are internally managed and most of our compensation is directly impacted by to redwood s financial performance  helping to align our interests with shareholders 
this is in contrast to the more common externally managed reit structure  where compensation is more closely linked to the amount of equity under management 
another important distinction is that the operating aspects of our business are increasing in importance relative to our investing activities 
our residential and commercial mortgage banking activities generate taxable earnings within an ordinary corporate structure 
returns from most of our mortgage related investments benefit from the tax efficiencies of a reit structure 
arriving at a value for redwood trust  inc on a consolidated basis requires valuing both the mortgage banking operations at our taxable reit subsidiaries and the investment activities at our reit 

table of contents one challenge to this hybrid model is that our dividend declarations and policy cannot be analyzed with the same investment framework commonly utilized for an investment in a pass through mortgage reit 
for us  dividends will not track our reit taxable income directly  as we generally intend to retain economic profits generated and taxed in our operating subsidiaries 
while retaining profits at these subsidiaries may lead to lower dividend pay out ratios and a lower dividend yielding common stock compared to other publicly traded mortgage reits  we believe it will enhance our ability to grow profitably 
as with most other operating companies  we will be retaining a portion of our gaap earnings  allowing us to fund growth internally 
we remain committed to paying a dividend as a portion of our generation of shareholder value 
we expect that the investing activities at our reit will remain a significant portion of our overall business 
these activities generate reit taxable income  most of which we must distribute as dividends over time in order to maintain our status as a reit 
furthermore  we are always aware that  in some circumstances  distributing as dividends the after tax earnings of our operating subsidiaries may be the best use of those earnings 
a portion of our future dividends could therefore be generated from these subsidiaries as well 
however  we generally intend to reinvest the after tax earnings in our operating subsidiaries with the goal of increasing the value of our common stock 
we believe that was  by and large  a fairly successful year for our business  as we were able to generate a return on equity for shareholders while executing on our strategic goals 
our residential loan platform goals for were to acquire billion of prime jumbo residential loans from originators and to complete four to six sequoia securitizations 
we exceeded those goals by acquiring billion of loans  increasing the number of active sellers to by the end of the year  and by completing six sequoia securitizations 
we were also able to invest an aggregate of million in new sequoia securitizations during our commercial loan platform goals for were to originate between and million of mezzanine commercial loans and to obtain debt financing for this portfolio 
we also successfully completed a secured financing of our mezzanine commercial loan portfolio in the fourth quarter of while we originated million of mezzanine commercial loans  we also shifted our strategy in the second half of to transition toward originating senior commercial loans and increasing gain on sale or fee income 
we originated million of senior commercial loans of which million were table funded and are working to expand this aspect of our platform in the year ahead 
for  our residential platform goals are to add additional loan sellers  loan products  and capital sources 
we also have a goal to acquire and securitize approximately billion of residential mortgage loans in we expect that the majority of the residential loans we acquire will be jumbo loans that are too large ie  over  in most areas and over  in high cost areas to be sold to fannie mae or freddie mac the agencies 
we also plan to acquire jumbo conforming loans  those loans between  and  the fees the agencies charge originators to guarantee these loans are rising at the same time that our operations and securitizations are becoming more efficient 
as a result  we believe we will be able to compete for and profit from the acquisition and securitization of jumbo conforming loans 

table of contents we also believe we can begin to profit later in from accumulating conforming residential loans balances under  that conform to the agencies underwriting standards and then selling them to the agencies 
we currently have approval to sell conforming loans we acquire to freddie mac  and we are working toward obtaining similar approval from fannie mae 
in addition  we see attractive opportunities for the first time in many years to acquire msrs associated with conforming loans 
in order to manage msrs and to accommodate the expected growth in our jumbo loan conduit activities  we recently leased office space in denver  colorado  a supportive environment with a good labor pool of skilled mortgage banking professionals where we expect to be able to hire many of the personnel needed to meet our residential platform goals 
we believe this is an area that could generate healthy volume and profits for us in the future 
we are also interested in potential credit risk sharing opportunities with the agencies 
we are one of several companies that have been sharing ideas with the agencies on risk sharing  which appears to be a more complicated concept than initially envisioned 
given the size of the agency market  we believe the potential to participate in risk sharing could be substantial 
our commercial loan platform goals for include originating for sale billion of senior commercial loans and originating for investment million of mezzanine commercial loans 
we are off to a good start in  having originated and funded million of senior commercial loans and million of mezzanine commercial loans through february  residential mortgage banking activities our sequoia residential mortgage loan platform had a strong fourth quarter and full year in as measured by increases in loans we identified for purchase from third party originators sellers  number of loan sellers we conduct business with  securitization loan volume  and retained investments created from our sequoia securitizations 
we completed two sequoia securitizations totaling million in the fourth quarter of  as compared to one sequoia securitization of million in the third quarter of our volume of loans identified for purchase grew to billion during the fourth quarter of  up from billion during the third quarter of  as a result of increased volume from both new and existing loan sellers 
the increased volume from our sellers was largely driven by low mortgage rates that compelled existing homeowners to refinance their mortgages 
we added active sellers in the fourth quarter to increase the total to at december  growth in the number of sellers is expected to slow in as we refine our targeted seller base 
however  our acquisition volume is driven not only by the number of sellers we do business with  but also the quantity of loans we acquire from those sellers 
our sellers are located throughout the us and currently consist of regional and community banks or their subsidiaries and mortgage companies 
we attempt to consistently offer these sellers competitive pricing on and year jumbo fixed rate residential mortgages 
sellers can address their interest rate exposure by selling loans they originate to us  a non bank counterparty  without the concern that we are a direct competitor for their retail borrower relationships 
our fourth quarter loan acquisitions totaled million  up from million in the third quarter of at december  we had million of residential loans on our balance sheet  as compared to million at september  this reflects million of loan acquisitions and million of fair value increases  less million of principal payments  million of whole loan sales  and million of sales into the october and november sequoia securitizations 
at december   residential loans we had identified for purchase totaled billion 
in january  we completed two additional securitizations totaling billion and identified an additional million of loans for purchase  our largest monthly total since we re established our sequoia platform in at february   residential loans we had identified for purchase totaled billion  and residential loans held on our balance sheet for future sale or securitization totaled million 
we expect to complete up to two additional securitizations during the first quarter of  or up to four for the entire quarter 
we have yet to see significant residential loan gain on sale margin compression in our residential business  which we attribute largely to sustained refinance volume and a strengthening economy 
our refinance volume continues to remain in line with the market the mortgage bankers association estimates that of fourth quarter mortgage originations were refinancing transactions 
since a high percentage of the loans being originated in the residential mortgage market today are interest rate driven refinancings  it will be more difficult for the market to grow and for margins to remain elevated if mortgage rates rise significantly  despite recent declines in us unemployment and increased home purchase activity 
while we believe that an eventual reduction in loan refinance activity is likely to the extent that interest rates begin to rise  our plan to sustain or grow our loan volume and market share in and beyond entails adding additional sellers in and beyond  adding additional loan products  and  enhancing our infrastructure to further accommodate loan volume growth 
at the end of the fourth quarter of  we owned msrs on billion of prime quality jumbo residential loans acquired through our residential loan platform 
approximately half of the portfolio was acquired in the fourth quarter of the capitalized value of these msrs was million  or basis points of the principal amount of the associated mortgage loans 
we earn fees from these msrs  but outsource the actual servicing 
we expect servicing fees to increase over time and become an increasing contributor to earnings 

table of contents commercial mortgage banking activities we continued to make steady progress with our commercial business in the fourth quarter of in late november  we completed a million securitization of our mezzanine investment portfolio  the first of its kind with multiple collateral property types in the post financial crisis period 
the securitization provided us with permanent non recourse financing for of the portfolio  freed up million of cash for additional investment  and increased the yield on our retained subordinate investment to a more attractive level 
for accounting purposes  the securitization is treated as a financing and the loans remain on our balance sheet as commercial loans with the related debt shown as asset backed securities issued redwood 
at december   we had million of commercial loans including million of unsecuritized loans and million of securitized loans  as compared to million at september  the change reflects the origination of six loans totaling million  the sale of one loan for million  and million of loan loss provisions 
our senior commercial loan origination initiative began to gain traction in the fourth quarter of we originated two senior commercial loans in the fourth quarter totaling million that also provided million of mezzanine loans for our investment portfolio 
we sold the remaining senior loan balance of one of those loans plus an additional million senior loan we originated in the third quarter of to cmbs conduits  and recorded income of million from those sales 
we expect to sell the remaining senior commercial loan that we originated in the fourth quarter of and others we originate in subsequent quarters to cmbs conduits and generate additional income from these sales 
our origination and sale of senior commercial loans will increase the returns from our commercial activities 
since year end and through february   we originated seven senior commercial loans totaling million of which million were table funded through and at february   we had four senior commercial loans for million in the application stage of origination 
in the fourth quarter of  we funded four mezzanine commercial loans totaling million 
this increased our full year mezzanine loan origination activity to loans totaling million 
at december   our mezzanine commercial loan portfolio consisted of investments totaling million 
this excludes an million commercial senior loan we held for sale at december  the gross yield on the mezzanine commercial loan portfolio  prior to the application of gaap loan loss provisions  was just over and was funded through a combination of the november securitization we completed and equity 
while we expect mezzanine commercial loan origination opportunities to wane over time  we still expect to find attractive opportunities in and through february   we had originated five mezzanine loans totaling million 
we continue to target up to million of equity capital to fund our commercial investments and mortgage banking activities  although it is possible that our allocation could exceed that amount from time to time in anticipation of asset sales or other transactions 
financial results fourth quarter we believe our residential and commercial businesses continued to generate attractive results in the fourth quarter of fourth quarter highlights include we completed two residential securitizations totaling million at year end  we held residential loans totaling million for sale or securitization and our loans we had identified for purchase was billion our residential loan gain on sale margins remained elevated we completed a secured financing of million of mezzanine commercial loans  generating million in capital for reinvestment we originated four new mezzanine commercial loans totaling million we made progress on our senior commercial loan initiative  originating two loans totaling million and ending with loans in the application stage of origination of million 
we maintained positive earnings momentum in the fourth quarter of  earning million  or per share  as compared to million  or per share  in the third quarter of we believe that our key earnings metrics were encouraging 
in terms of the major earnings components after giving effect to the one time reclassification adjustments described below  net interest income on our investments was in line with past quarters  mortgage banking income continued to trend higher  operating expenses were up only modestly from the third quarter due to our expanding infrastructure  and realized gains on sales were lower than the third quarter 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  we sold our remaining interests in nine legacy acacia entities and ten legacy sequoia entities 
our interests in these entities had an aggregate economic value of approximately million 
from a financial reporting standpoint  however  our interests in these legacy entities added significant complexity to our balance sheet presentation  as we were required to consolidate these legacy entities underlying assets and liabilities  which totaled million and million  respectively  at november  the sale of our interests in these legacy entities triggered a derecognition of their underlying assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and resulted in a million net  non recurring increase to fourth quarter earnings 
the million net  non recurring increase is not reflected as a simple line item in our fourth quarter income statement 
instead  it is expressed as an million decrease to net interest income  reflecting the accelerated recognition of acacia entities deferred hedging costs  and a million realized gain upon deconsolidation 
the million gain primarily reflects the proceeds we received on the sale of our interests in these legacy entities  as well as our recovery of excess loan loss reserves related to legacy sequoia entities that we were required to record in past periods under gaap 
the following table sets forth the components of our third and fourth quarter net income  together with a non gaap presentation of the components of our fourth quarter net income 
the non gaap presentation reflects two reclassification adjustments which  overall  do not impact reported net income under gaap  but which reflect the impact of the deconsolidation of legacy acacia and sequoia entities in a manner consistent with the way management analyzes fourth quarter net income results and the manner in which management compares our fourth quarter results to our third quarter results

first  net interest income is increased by million to address the non recurring impact on net interest income of million of accelerated recognition of deferred hedging costs relating to acacia entities and resulting from the deconsolidation of these entities 
second  realized gain on deconsolidation is decreased by million to reflect that the deconsolidation of sequoia and acacia entities resulted in a non recurring net gain of only million 
total realized gains  net were million as reported under gaap for the three months ended december  continuing on with our fourth quarter results  the million of mortgage banking income we realized in the fourth quarter of made up a larger share of our reported net income than the million we reported for the third quarter of the increase was due to higher residential securitization and loan acquisition volumes  and attractive gain on sale margins that remain well above the more normalized to basis points that we expect to earn over time from this activity 
our profits on residential loans we have accumulated and sold into securitizations continue to be driven by the relatively wide spread between jumbo mortgage rates and securitization funding costs 
net interest income  the other primary revenue driver  was million in the fourth quarter of as adjusted by the non gaap reclassification set forth in the table above  which was equal to gaap net interest income in the third quarter of  as our investment activity for third party securities remained subdued 
as reported under gaap  net interest income for the fourth quarter was million

our residential securities portfolio was up over percentage points in price  or million  in the fourth quarter of  due in part to the overall firming of home prices and the federal reserve s continued purchases of agency mbs 
given strong demand for seasoned residential securities and a steady decline in market yields  we continued to strategically sell selected positions and generate capital for new investments 
we did not purchase any third party securities in the fourth quarter of our fourth quarter portfolio investment activity was instead driven by our acquisition of million of subordinate and io securities created from new sequoia securitizations 
for all of  we created and retained million of securities from sequoia securitizations 
over time  we expect that investments created through our sequoia program or other mortgage banking activities  as well as through the acquisition of newly issued subordinate

net interest income after provision and other mva net interest income after provision and other mva was million for the fourth quarter for  as compared to million for the fourth quarter of  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to fewer negative market valuation adjustments taken the fourth quarter of  as impairments on securities and derivative expenses declined by million 
in addition  our loan loss provision expense declined million as the overall credit quality of loans at legacy sequoia entities improved during these amounts were partially offset by a decline in net interest income of million  primarily due to a one time expense of million at consolidating entities 
this expense represents an acceleration of acacia related hedging expenses as a result of our deconsolidation of all remaining acacia entities for financial reporting purposes during the fourth quarter of for further discussion  see the financial results fourth quarter section and the net interest income at consolidated entities section of this management s discussion and analysis 
of the million of net income earned during the three months ended december   we recognized net income of million for the fourth quarter from our investments in legacy sequoia and acacia securitization entities  as compared to net income of million for the previous quarter 
this increase was primarily attributable to the million net  non recurring increase to earnings recognized upon deconsolidation of certain securitization entities 
this increase was partially offset by declining interest income as average earning assets at these entities continue to paydown or be deconsolidated

in the third quarter of  we began recognizing all changes in fair value for residential loans held for sale through our income statement 
we believe that accounting change further aligns our reported gaap results with the economics underlying our residential loan activities 
consequently  we expect gains or losses on the sale of residential loans during subsequent reporting periods to be smaller  all else equal  since we expect their cost basis at the end of each quarter to already reflect the price at which we believe they could be sold 
income from mortgage banking activities  net also included million in gains from the sale of million of loans through securitization and whole loan sales 
these gains were partially offset by hedging expenses of million 
an additional result of our adoption of fair value accounting for new residential loans held for sale is the greater likelihood that hedging gains or losses will be offset by gains or losses in the value of our loans during the same quarter that the valuation changes occur  as opposed to a potential offset in a future quarter

summary of financial condition  capital resources  and liquidity at december   our total capital was billion  including billion in stockholders equity and million of long term debt 
at december   we estimated our investment capacity defined as the amount of capital we have readily available for long term investments at approximately million  which should be sufficient to sustain our capital needs through the first quarter of to carry out our plans for investment in future sequoia securitizations  msrs  and other business initiatives  we expect to need more capital during as a result  we are considering raising capital from external sources  such as through a debt or equity offering 
we also continue to maintain the option of raising capital through just in time common stock issuances through our direct stock purchase plan 
our approach to raising capital will continue to be based on what we believe to be in the best long term interest of shareholders 

table of contents changes in book value and estimated non gaap economic value during the fourth quarter of  our gaap book value increased by per share to per share 
the net increase resulted from a per share increase from reported earnings  per share increase in net positive valuation increases on securities not reflected in earnings  a per share increase in value of derivative hedges related to long term debt not reflected in earnings  a per share increase from a share issuance  and a per share increase from other net positive items  offset by per share from dividends paid to shareholders 
at december   our estimate of non gaap economic value per share was  or per share higher than our reported gaap book value per share 
this difference is made up of the following components the economic valuation of our long term debt of million without giving effect to interest rate agreements designated as cash flow hedges with respect to long term debt  was million  or per share  below the unamortized cost basis used to determine gaap book value  the economic valuation of our net investment in sequoia of million was million  or per share  above the net unamortized cost basis used to determine gaap book value  the economic valuation of our net investment in the commercial securitization of was million  or per share  above the net unamortized cost basis used to determine gaap book value  and  the economic valuation of our investment in the residential resecuritization of million  was million  or per share  below the net unamortized cost basis used to determine gaap book value 
a further discussion of our estimate of non gaap economic value is set forth below under investments in consolidated entities and factors affecting management s estimate of economic book value 
investments in consolidated entities the estimated carrying value of our investments in the sequoia securitization entities totaled million  or of our equity capital at december  the carrying value reflects the estimated book value of our retained investments in these entities  based on the difference between the consolidated assets and liabilities of the entities in the aggregate according to their gaap carrying amounts 
during the fourth quarter of  cash flow generated by our investments in these entities totaled million 
management s estimate of the non gaap economic value of our investments in these entities was million 
of this amount  million consisted of ios and million consisted of senior and subordinate securities at sequoia entities 
factors affecting management s estimate of economic book value in reviewing our non gaap estimate of economic value  there are a number of important factors and limitations to consider 
the estimated economic value of our stockholders equity is calculated as of a particular point in time based on our existing assets and liabilities or  in certain cases  our estimate of economic value of our existing assets and liabilities  and does not incorporate other factors that may have a significant impact on that value  most notably the impact of future business activities 
as a result  the estimated economic value of our stockholders equity does not necessarily represent an estimate of our net realizable value  liquidation value  or our market value as a whole 
amounts we ultimately realize from the disposition of assets or settlement of liabilities may vary significantly from the estimated economic values of those assets and liabilities 
because temporary changes in market conditions can substantially affect our estimate of the economic value of our stockholders equity  we do not believe that short term fluctuations in the economic value of our assets and liabilities are necessarily representative of the effectiveness of our investment strategy or the long term underlying value of our business 
our estimated non gaap economic value is calculated using bid side asset marks or estimated bid side values and offer side marks for our financial liabilities or estimated offered side values  when available  using the same valuation process used to estimate the fair values of our other financial assets and liabilities under gaap 
when quoted market prices or observable market data are not available to estimate fair value  we rely on level inputs 
because assets and liabilities classified as level are generally based on unobservable inputs  the process of calculating economic value is generally subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
these assumptions may have a significant effect on our estimates of economic value  and the use of different assumptions as well as changes in market conditions could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million at september   an increase of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to the cash raised from two sequoia securitizations  cash raised from our commercial securitization  and residential and commercial loan sales to third parties  offset by acquisitions of residential mortgage loans and originations of commercial loans 
as a supplement to the consolidated statements of cash flows included in this annual report on form k  the following table details our sources and uses of cash for the three and twelve months ended december   in a manner consistent with the way management analyzes them 
this table illustrates our cash balances at december   september   and december  each a gaap amount  and organizes the components of sources and uses of cash non gaap amounts by aggregating and netting all items within our gaap consolidated statements of cash flows that were attributable to the periods presented

therefore  i cash flow generated by these investments in a given period is not necessarily reflective of the long term economic return we will earn on the investments and ii it is difficult to determine what portion of the cash received from an investment is a return of principal and what portion is a return on principal in a given period 
this table excludes cash flow generated by our investments in the sequoia and acacia entities and the fund cash flow that is not available to redwood  but does include the cash flow distributed to redwood as a result of our investments in these entities 
sources of cash from loans  securities  and investments includes the gross cash flow received from the securities that were included in the residential resecuritization  net of the principal and interest payments made in respect of the abs issued in that residential resecuritization as well as the gross cash flow received from the commercial loans that were included in the commercial securitization  net of the principal and interest payments made in respect of the abs issued in that commercial securitization

the fair value of these securities are less than of the fair value of the total securities

we anticipate electing the fair value option for future purchases of residential loans that we intend to sell to third parties or transfer to sequoia securitizations

table of contents securitization sponsored by us that meets the gaap criteria for sale 
our receipt of msr income is not subject to any covenants other than customary performance obligations associated with servicing residential loans 
for loans that we have transferred into securitizations while maintaining the associated servicing rights  the sub servicer we contract with to perform servicing activities may be terminated if it fails to perform under the applicable contractual terms 
if the sub servicer is terminated for a breach of contract  a new sub servicer would need to be approved by the master servicer and assume the servicing responsibilities in accordance with the applicable pooling and servicing agreement 
if a sub servicer we contract with was to default  we would evaluate our msr asset for impairment at that time 
in  we earned a net thousand from these msrs and at december   the fair value of these msrs was million 
although we retain the rights to service certain loans we securitize or sell  we employ a sub servicer to perform these activities 
the decline in value of our msrs during is primarily the result of a decline in mortgage rates observed during the year that had a negative effect on the valuations of our msr asset as both our prepayment and discount rates estimates increased  adversely affecting valuations 
risk management derivatives related to our residential and commercial loan business net valuation losses from risk management derivatives related to our residential and commercial loans held for sale were million during as part of our ongoing risk management activities  we attempt to manage the risk of changes in the value of fixed rate and hybrid loans awaiting sale or securitization that would result primarily from a change in benchmark interest rates 
we are exposed to this risk between the time a mortgage interest rate is established for each loan we plan to acquire  through the time the loan is sold or securitized 
under normal market conditions and assuming we have managed this risk well  we would expect our risk management activities including the use of interest rate and other derivatives to reduce our risk exposure to changing interest rates so that the gain or loss in the value of our derivatives would  to varying degrees  offset a loss or gain in the value of these loans  and ultimately the loss or gain of those loans at the time they are sold 
gains on mortgage loan sales and securitizations net gains on mortgage loan sales during include the realized gain on the sale of residential loans to sequoia securitization entities we sponsored and sales of residential and commercial loans to third parties 
realized gains or losses include the net benefit of the gross proceeds from the sale of the loans  less the carrying value of the loans and any related issuance costs 
impact of mortgage banking activities  net  on redwood s operations excluded from mortgage banking activities  net  is the net interest income that we earn from the loans we acquire for future sale or securitization 
the net income from these loans is included as part of the interest income at redwood and the interest expense associated with the related borrowing costs from our warehouse facilities is included as part of the short term debt expense at redwood

in addition to the deconsolidation of acacia entities that occurred in the fourth quarter of  we also deconsolidated legacy sequoia entities in the majority of the deconsolidated sequoia entities had negative carrying values for gaap purposes and minimal economic values 
the net gain from deconsolidation is included in realized gains  net 
other mva at consolidated entities we applied the fair value option provided under gaap to account for the assets eg  loans and securities and liabilities eg  abs issued at the consolidated acacia entities 
this option requires that changes in the fair value of these assets and liabilities be recorded in the consolidated statements of income each reporting period 
derivative assets and liabilities at acacia securitization entities are accounted for as trading instruments with all changes in the fair value of these assets and liabilities recorded as other market valuation adjustments through our consolidated statements of income 
due to the deconsolidation of the acacia entities during the fourth quarter of  we reclassified million of unrealized losses on derivatives to interest expense

loan loss provision at consolidated sequoia entities each quarter we utilize a loan loss reserving methodology that has been established to provide management with a reasonable and adequate estimate of loan loss reserving needs 
this methodology is disclosed in note and note to the financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
the provision for loan losses at legacy consolidated sequoia entities sequoia securitizations issued prior to that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes was less than million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the decrease in the provision from to was primarily attributable to the improved performance of our troubled debt restructuring loan population over the course of  as well as a significant decline in delinquent balances in the overall consolidated sequoia loan population 
during  we also derecognized million of the allowance for loan losses related to sequoia entities that were deconsolidated for financial reporting purposes 
the provision for loan losses was less than the net charge offs of million or of outstanding loan balances for the year ended december   and the provision for loan losses was greater than the net charge offs of million or of outstanding loan balances for the year ended december  this resulted in a decrease of million and million in our allowance for loan losses for the years ended and  respectively 
charge offs were generated by million and million of defaulted loan principal during and  respectively  for average implied loss severities of and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision from to was primarily attributable to a gradual decline in serious delinquencies as well as a significant decline in the amount of delinquent loans being foreclosed upon and charged off in accordance with our policy 
the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs of million or of outstanding loan balances and million or of outstanding loan balances for and  respectively 
this resulted in an increase of million and million in our allowance for loan losses for and  respectively 
these charge offs were generated by million and million of defaulted loan principal for average implied loss severities of and for and  respectively 
during  the allowance for loan losses decreased to million or of outstanding residential loans held for investment balances at december   from million or of outstanding residential loans held for investment balances at december   and million or of outstanding residential loans held for investment balances at december  serious delinquencies on loans held at consolidated sequoia entities days delinquent decreased to million or of outstanding loan balances at december   from million or of outstanding loan balances at december   and decreased from million or of outstanding loan balances at december  loans originated in florida  new jersey  california  georgia  and new york accounted for of total loans held by sequoia entities and made up of the serious delinquent loan balance at december  at december   we estimate that there was one sequoia entity that we consolidated for which the carrying value of the entity s liabilities exceeded the corresponding carrying value of the entity s assets 
this is primarily attributable to the continued building of loan loss allowances in accordance with gaap  resulting in lower asset carrying values 
the aggregate estimated net assets or equity at this consolidated entity were less than negative million at december   an amount we expect to reverse through positive adjustments to earnings in future periods as the entity is retired or deconsolidated for financial reporting purposes

loan repurchase risk subsidiaries of redwood have purchased residential mortgage loans and either deposited those loans into sequoia securitization trusts sponsored by rwt holdings  inc  a redwood subsidiary  or sold those loans to third parties 
the sequoia trusts have subsequently issued residential mortgage backed securities  some of these sequoia securitization trusts are not currently consolidated on our balance sheet for financial reporting purposes 
we continue to engage in purchasing  securitizing and selling residential mortgage loans 
in connection with securitizations and loan sales  subsidiaries of redwood make and will continue to make certain representations and warranties related to residential mortgage loans that could result in an obligation to repurchase these loans to the extent a violation of these representations and warranties occurred 
we do not originate residential loans and believe that risk of loss due to loan repurchases ie  due to a breach of representations and warranties would generally be a contingency to the third party entity from whom we acquired the loans 
however  in some cases  where loans were acquired from entities that have since become insolvent  repurchase claims would not be a contingency to a third party and may result in repurchase claims made against us 
as of december   there have been no loan level repurchase claims made to redwood by sequoia investors or third party loan purchasers where the entity that originated the loans in question was insolvent 
as a result  while it is possible that we may receive repurchase claims related to these securitizations in the future  we cannot make a reasonable estimate of potential future liabilities based on historical experience to date 
we do not currently maintain a loan repurchase reserve and management is not aware of any outstanding repurchase claims against redwood that would require the establishment of such a reserve 
in circumstances where we believe that there is a risk of loss due to a specific loan repurchase demand ie  due to an allegation of a breach of representations and warranties  we will review the need for any loan repurchase reserve in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for contingencies and establish reserves when  in the opinion of management  it is probable that a matter would result in a liability and the amount of loss  if any  can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  with respect to residential mortgage backed securities issued by sequoia securitization trusts prior to  we believe that investors seeking recovery for any losses they incur on investments in these securities may be more likely to pursue remedies through securities related litigation rather than through specific loan repurchase claims 
we separately evaluate our exposure to such litigation when assessing whether the establishment of a litigation reserve is necessary under gaap

ratio of earnings to fixed charges the ratio of earnings to fixed charges represents the number of times fixed charges are covered by earnings 
fixed charges consist of interest on outstanding asset backed securities issued and debt and amortization of debt discount and expense 
the proportion deemed representative of the interest factor of operating lease expense has not been deducted as the total operating lease expense in itself was de minimis and did not affect the ratios in a material way 
earnings consist of consolidated income before income taxes and fixed charges

long term debt at redwood in and  we issued a total of million and million of long term debt  respectively 
this debt requires quarterly distributions at a floating rate equal to three month libor plus until the notes are redeemed in whole 
beginning in the first quarter of  we entered into interest rate swaps with aggregate notional values currently totaling million to hedge the variability in our long term debt interest expense  fixing our gross interest expense yield at 
these swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges with all interest income recorded as a component of net interest income and other valuation changes recorded as a component of equity

at december   there were million carrying value of commercial loans owned at the commercial securitization  which were funded with million of abs issued 
asset backed securities issued at securitization entities at december   there were billion of loans owned at sequoia securitization entities  which were funded with billion of abs issued at sequoia entities 
these loans and abs issued are reported at their unpaid principal balances net of any unamortized premium or discount 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our remaining interests in the acacia entities and derecognized the associated assets and liabilities

although the stated maturity is as shown  the abs obligations will pay down as the principal balances of these real estate loans or securities pay down 
the amount shown is the principal balance of the abs issued and not necessarily the value reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated interest payments on consolidated abs issued is calculated based on the contractual maturity of the abs and therefore assumes no prepayments of the principal outstanding at december  
table of contents potential gaap earnings volatility we expect quarter to quarter gaap earnings volatility from our business activities 
this volatility can occur for a variety of reasons  including the timing and amount of purchases  sales  calls  and repayment of consolidated assets  changes in the fair values of consolidated assets and liabilities  increases or decreases in earnings from mortgage banking activities  and certain non recurring events 
in addition  the amount or timing of our reported earnings may be impacted by technical accounting issues  some of which are described below 
changes in premium amortization for loans the net unamortized premium for loans owned at consolidated sequoia entities  the commercial securitization  and at redwood was million at december  the amount of periodic premium amortization expense we recognize is volatile and dependent on a number of factors  including credit performance of the underlying loans  changes in prepayment speeds  and changes in short term interest rates 
loan premium amortization was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
changes in allowance for loan losses for real estate loans classified as held for investment  we establish and maintain an allowance for loan losses based on our estimate of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolios at the reporting date 
to calculate the allowance for loan losses  we assess inherent losses by determining loss factors defaults  loss severities on default liquidations  and the timing of default liquidations that can be specifically applied to each of the consolidated loans or pools of loans 
changes in actual defaults or our expectations on loss severities and default timing can have a significant effect on periodic income 
changes in the fair value of residential and commercial loans held at fair value the majority of unsecuritized residential loans on our consolidated balance sheet at december   were being held for future securitizations and expected to be sold to non consolidated entities 
at the time of purchase  we may elect the fair value option for these loans 
for residential loans for which we have elected the fair value option  changes in fair values are recorded in mortgage banking activities  net  through the consolidated statements of income in the period in which the valuation change occurs 
periodic fluctuations in the values of these investments are inherently volatile and thus can lead to significant period to period gaap earnings volatility 
loans classified as held for sale that are not carried at fair value are carried at the lower of their cost basis or fair value 
if the fair value of loans is lower than their cost basis  the difference is reported as a negative market valuation adjustment through other market valuation adjustments  net  through the consolidated statements of income in the period in which the valuation change occurs 
the fair value of loans is affected by  among other things  changes in interest rates  credit performance  prepayments  and market liquidity 
to the extent interest rates change or market liquidity and or credit conditions materially change  the value of these loans could decline below their cost basis  which could have a material effect on reported earnings 
changes in yields for securities the yields we project on real estate securities can have a significant effect on the periodic interest income we recognize for financial reporting purposes 
yields can vary as a function of credit results  prepayment rates  and interest rates 
if estimated future credit losses are less than our prior estimate  credit losses occur later than expected  or prepayment rates are faster than expected meaning the present value of projected cash flows is greater than previously expected for assets acquired at a discount to principal balance  the yield over the remaining life of the security may be adjusted upwards 
if estimated future credit losses exceed our prior expectations  credit losses occur more quickly than expected  or prepayments occur more slowly than expected meaning the present value of projected cash flows is less than previously expected for assets acquired at a discount to principal balance  the yield over the remaining life of the security may be adjusted downward 
changes in the actual maturities of real estate securities may also affect their yields to maturity 
actual maturities are affected by the contractual lives of the associated mortgage collateral  periodic payments of principal  and prepayments of principal 
therefore  actual maturities of afs securities are generally shorter than stated contractual maturities 
stated contractual maturities are generally greater than ten years 
there is no assurance that our assumptions used to estimate future cash flows or the current period s yield for each asset will not change in the near term  and any change could be material 

table of contents changes in fair values of securities all securities owned at redwood and consolidated entities are classified as either trading or afs securities  and in both cases are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair values 
for trading securities  changes in fair values are recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
periodic fluctuations in the values of these investments are inherently volatile and thus can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
for afs securities  cumulative unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of changes in equity 
unrealized gains are not credited to current earnings and unrealized losses are not charged against current earnings to the extent they are temporary in nature 
certain factors may require us  however  to recognize declines in the values of afs securities as other than temporary impairments and record them through our current earnings 
factors that determine other than temporary impairment include a change in our ability or intent to hold afs securities  adverse changes to projected cash flows of assets  or the likelihood that declines in the fair values of assets would not return to their previous levels within a reasonable time 
impairments on afs securities can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
in addition  sales of securities in large unrealized gain or loss positions that are not impaired can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments we can experience significant earnings volatility from our use of derivatives 
we generally use derivatives as part of our mortgage banking activities eg  to manage risks associated with loans we plan to acquire and subsequently sell or securitize  and to manage variability in debt interest expense indexed to adjustable rates  and cash flows on assets and liabilities that have different coupon rates fixed rates versus floating rates  or floating rates based on different indices 
the nature of the instruments we use and the accounting treatment for the specific assets  liabilities  and derivatives may therefore lead to volatility in our periodic earnings  even when we are meeting our hedging objectives 
some of our derivatives are accounted for as trading instruments with all associated changes in value recorded through our consolidated statements of income 
changes in value of the assets and liabilities we manage by using derivatives may not be accounted for similarly 
this could lead to reported income and book values in specific periods that do not necessarily reflect the economics of our risk management strategy 
even when the assets and liabilities are similarly accounted for as trading instruments  periodic changes in their values may not coincide as other market factors eg  supply and demand may affect certain instruments and not others at any given time 
changes in loss contingency reserves we may be exposed to various loss contingencies  including  without limitation  those described in note to the financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for contingencies  we review the need for any loss contingency reserves and establish them when  in the opinion of management  it is probable that a matter would result in a liability  and the amount of loss  if any  can be reasonably estimated 
the establishment of a loss contingency reserve  the subsequent increase in a reserve or release of reserves previously established  or the recognition of a loss in excess of previously established reserves  can occur as a result of various factors and events that affect management s opinion of whether the standard for establishing  increasing  or continuing to maintain  a reserve has been met 
changes in the loss contingency reserves can lead to significant gaap earnings volatility each quarter 
risks relating to short term debt incurred under residential mortgage loan warehouse facilities  securities repurchase facilities  and other short term debt facilities  and risks relating to debt incurred under commercial debt investment repurchase facilities as described above under the heading results of operations redwood parent  in the ordinary course of our business  we use debt financing obtained through several different types of borrowing facilities to  among other things  fund the acquisition of residential mortgage loans we acquire including those we acquire in anticipation of securitization  finance the commercial debt investments we originate and acquire  and finance investments in securities and other investments 
we may also use short term borrowings to fund other aspects of our business and operations 

table of contents residential loan warehouse facilities 
one source of our short term debt financing is secured borrowings under residential loan warehouse facilities that are in place with four different financial institution counterparties 
under these four warehouse facilities  we have an aggregate borrowing limit of billion  however  these facilities are uncommitted  which means that any request we make to borrow funds under these facilities may be declined for any reason  even if at the time of the borrowing request we have then outstanding borrowings that are less than the borrowing limits under these facilities 
short term financing for residential mortgage loans is obtained under these facilities by our transfer of mortgage loans to the counterparty in exchange for cash proceeds in an amount less than of the principal amount of the transferred mortgage loans  and our covenant to reacquire those loans from the counterparty for the same amount plus a financing charge 
in order to obtain financing for a residential loan under these facilities  the loan must initially and continuously while the financing remains outstanding meet certain eligibility criteria  including  without limitation  that the loan is not in a delinquent status 
in addition  under these warehouse facilities  residential loans can only be financed for a maximum period  which period would not generally exceed days 
we generally intend to repay the short term financing of a loan under one of these facilities at or prior to the expiration of that financing with the proceeds of a securitization or other sale of that loan  through the proceeds of other short term borrowings  or with other equity or long term debt capital 
while a residential loan is financed under a warehouse facility  to the extent the market value of the loan declines which market value is generally determined by the counterparty under the facility  we are required to either immediately reacquire the loan or meet a margin requirement to pledge additional collateral  such as cash or additional residential loans  in an amount at least equal to the decline in value 
see further discussion below under the heading margin call provisions associated with short term debt and other debt financing 
because these warehouse facilities are uncommitted  at any given time we may not be able to obtain additional financing under them when we need it  exposing us to  among other things  liquidity risks of the types described in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  under the heading risk factors  and in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks 
in addition  with respect to residential loans that at any given time are already being financed through these warehouse facilities  we are exposed to market  credit  liquidity  and other risks of the types described in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  under the heading risk factors  and in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks  if and when those loans become ineligible to be financed  decline in value  or have been financed for the maximum term permitted under the applicable facility 
under our residential loan warehouse facilities  we also make various representations and warranties and have agreed to certain covenants  events of default  and other terms that if breached or triggered can result in our being required to immediately repay all outstanding amounts borrowed under these facilities and these facilities being unavailable to use for future financing needs 
in particular  the terms of these facilities include financial covenants  cross default provisions  judgment default provisions  and other events of default such as  for example  events of default triggered by one of the following a change in control over redwood  regulatory investigation or enforcement action against redwood  redwood s failure to continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes  or redwood s failure to maintain the listing of its common stock on the new york stock exchange 
under a cross default provision  an event of default is triggered and the warehouse facility becomes unavailable and outstanding amounts borrowed thereunder become due and payable if an event of default or similar event occurs under another borrowing or credit facility we maintain in excess of a specified amount 
under a judgment default provision  an event of default is triggered and the warehouse facility becomes unavailable and outstanding amounts borrowed thereunder become due and payable if a judgment for damages in excess of a specified amount is entered against us in any litigation and we are unable to promptly satisfy the judgment 
financial covenants included in these warehouse facilities are further described below under the heading financial covenants associated with short term debt and other debt financing 
these residential loan warehouse facilities could also become unavailable and outstanding amounts borrowed thereunder could become immediately due and payable if there is a material adverse change in our business 
if we breach or trigger the representations and warranties  covenants  events of default  or other terms of our warehouse facilities  we are exposed to liquidity and other risks  including of the type described in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  under the heading risk factors  and in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks 
in addition to the four residential loan warehouse facilities described above  in the ordinary course of business we may seek to establish additional warehouse facilities that may be of a similar or greater size and may have similar or more restrictive terms 
in the event a counterparty to one or more of our warehouse facilities becomes insolvent or unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the facility  we may be unable to access short term financing we need or fail to recover the full value of our residential mortgage loans financed 

table of contents securities repurchase facilities 
another source of short term debt financing is through securities repurchase facilities we have established with various different financial institution counterparties 
under these facilities we do not have an aggregate borrowing limit  however  these facilities are uncommitted  which means that any request we make to borrow funds under these facilities may be declined for any reason 
short term financing for securities is obtained under these facilities by our transfer of securities to the counterparty in exchange for cash proceeds in an amount less than of the fair value of the transferred securities  and our covenant to reacquire those securities from the counterparty for the same amount plus a financing charge 
under these securities repurchase facilities  securities are financed for a fixed period  which would not generally exceed days 
we generally intend to repay the short term financing of a security under one of these facilities through a renewal of that financing with the same counterparty  through a sale of the security  or with other equity or long term debt capital 
while a security is financed under a securities repurchase facility  to the extent the value of the security declines which value is generally determined by the counterparty under the facility  we are required to either immediately reacquire the security or meet a margin requirement to pledge additional collateral  such as cash or us treasury securities  in an amount at least equal to the decline in value 
see further discussion below under the heading margin call provisions associated with short term debt and other debt financing 
at the end of the fixed period applicable to the financing of a security under a securities repurchase facility  if we intend to continue to obtain financing for that security we would typically request the same counterparty to renew the financing for an additional fixed period 
if the same counterparty does not renew the financing  it may be difficult for us to obtain financing for that security under one of our other securities repurchase facilities  due to the fact that the financial institution counterparties to our securities repurchase facilities generally only provide financing for securities that we purchased from them or one of their affiliates 
because our securities repurchase facilities are uncommitted  at any given time we may not be able to obtain additional financing under them when we need it  exposing us to  among other things  liquidity risks of the types described in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  under the heading risk factors  and in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks 
in addition  with respect to securities that at any given time are already being financed through our securities repurchase facilities  we are exposed to market  credit  liquidity  and other risks of the types described in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  under the heading risk factors  and in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks  if and when those securities decline in value  or have been financed for the maximum term permitted under the applicable facility 
under our securities repurchase facilities  we also make various representations and warranties and have agreed to certain covenants  events of default  and other terms including of the type described above under the heading residential loan warehouse facilities that if breached or triggered can result in our being required to immediately repay all outstanding amounts borrowed under these facilities and these facilities being unavailable to use for future financing needs 
in particular  the terms of these facilities include financial covenants  cross default provisions  judgment default provisions  and other events of default including of the type described above under the heading residential loan warehouse facilities 
financial covenants included in our repurchase facilities are further described below under the heading financial covenants associated with short term debt and other debt financing 
our securities repurchase facilities could also become unavailable and outstanding amounts borrowed thereunder could become immediately due and payable if there is a material adverse change in our business 
if we breach or trigger the representations and warranties  covenants  events of default  or other terms of our securities repurchase facilities  we are exposed to liquidity and other risks  including of the type described in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  under the heading risk factors  and in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks 
in the ordinary course of business we may seek to establish additional securities repurchase facilities that may have similar or more restrictive terms 
in the event a counterparty to one or more of our securities repurchase facilities becomes insolvent or unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the facility  we may be unable to access the short term financing we need or fail to recover the full value of our securities financed 
other short term debt facilities 
we also maintain a million committed line of short term credit from a bank  which is secured by our pledge of certain mortgage backed securities we own 
this bank line of credit is an additional source of short term financing for us 
similar to the uncommitted warehouse and securities repurchase facilities described herein  under this committed line we make various representations and warranties and have agreed to certain covenants  events of default  and other terms that if breached or triggered can result in our being required to immediately repay all outstanding amounts borrowed under this facility and this facility being unavailable to use for future financing needs 
the margin call provisions and financial covenants included in this committed line are further described below under the headings margin call provisions associated with short term debt and other debt financing and financial covenants associated with short term debt and other debt financing 
when we use this committed line to incur short term debt we are exposed to the market  credit  liquidity  and other types of risks described above with respect to residential loan warehouse and securities repurchase facilities 

table of contents commercial debt investment repurchase facility 
another source of debt financing is secured borrowings through a commercial debt investment repurchase facility we have established with a financial institution counterparty that was in place at december  under this repurchase facility  we have an aggregate borrowing limit of million  however  any request we make to borrow funds under this facility secured by a particular commercial debt investment may be declined for any reason  even if at the time of the borrowing request we have then outstanding borrowings that are less than the borrowing limits under this facility 
financing for commercial debt investments is obtained under this facility by our transfer of commercial debt investments to a special purpose entity which is beneficially owned by the counterparty in exchange for cash proceeds in an amount less than of the principal amount of the transferred commercial debt investments  and our covenant to reacquire those commercial debt investments for the same amount plus a financing charge 
other periodic payments are also due under the facility 
in order to obtain financing for a commercial debt investment under this facility  the commercial debt investment must initially and continuously while the financing remains outstanding meet certain eligibility criteria  including  without limitation  that the commercial debt investment is not in a delinquent status 
this facility has a three year term 
we generally intend to repay the financing of a commercial debt investment under this facility at or prior to the expiration of the financing term with the proceeds of a securitization or other sale of that commercial debt investment  or with other equity or long term debt capital 
while a commercial debt investment is financed under this facility  to the extent the value of the commercial debt investment declines which value is generally determined by the counterparty under the facility  we are required to either immediately reacquire the commercial debt investment or meet a margin requirement to pledge additional collateral  such as cash or additional commercial debt investments  in an amount at least equal to the decline in value 
see further discussion below under the heading margin call provisions associated with short term debt and other debt financing 
because the counterparty under this facility retains discretion to accept or reject a financing with respect to any particular commercial debt investment  at any given time we may not be able to obtain additional financing under this facility when we need it  exposing us to  among other things  liquidity risks of the types described in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  under the heading risk factors  and in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks 
in addition  with respect to commercial debt investments that at any given time are already being financed through this facility  we are exposed to market  credit  liquidity  and other risks of the types described in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  under the heading risk factors  and in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks  if and when those commercial debt investments become ineligible to be financed  decline in value  or have been financed for the maximum term permitted under the facility 
under our commercial debt investment repurchase facility  we also make various representations and warranties and have agreed to certain covenants  events of default  and other terms that if breached or triggered can result in our being required to immediately repay all outstanding amounts borrowed under this facility and this facility being unavailable to use for future financing needs 
in particular  the terms of this facility include financial covenants  cross default provisions  judgment default provisions  and other events of default such as  for example  events of default triggered by one or more of the following a change in control over redwood  regulatory investigation or enforcement action against redwood  or redwood s failure to continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes  or redwood s failure to maintain the listing of its common stock on the new york stock exchange 
under a cross default provision  an event of default is triggered and the facility becomes unavailable and outstanding amounts borrowed thereunder become due and payable if an event of default or similar event occurs under another borrowing or credit facility we maintain 
under a judgment default provision  an event of default is triggered and the facility becomes unavailable and outstanding amounts borrowed thereunder become due and payable if a judgment for damages in excess of a specified amount is entered against us in any litigation and we are unable to promptly satisfy the judgment 
financial covenants included in our repurchase facilities are further described below under the heading financial covenants associated with short term debt and other debt financing 
our commercial debt investment repurchase facility could also become unavailable and outstanding amounts borrowed thereunder could become immediately due and payable if there is a material adverse change in our business 
if we breach or trigger the representations and warranties  covenants  events of default  or other terms of this facility  we are exposed to liquidity and other risks  including of the type described in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  under the heading risk factors  and in part ii  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading market risks 
in addition to the commercial debt investment repurchase facility described above  in the ordinary course of business we may seek to establish additional facilities that may be of a similar or greater size and may have similar or more restrictive terms 
in the event a counterparty to one or more of our facilities becomes insolvent or unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under a facility  we may be unable to access the financing we need or we may fail to recover the full value of our commercial debt investments financed under the applicable facility 

table of contents financial covenants associated with short term debt and other debt financing set forth below is a summary of the financial covenants associated with our short term debt and other debt financing facilities 
residential loan warehouse facilities 
as noted above  one source of our short term debt financing is secured borrowings under residential loan warehouse facilities we have established with four different financial institution counterparties 
financial covenants included in these warehouse facilities are as follows and at december   and through the date of this annual report on form k  we were in compliance with each of these financial covenants maintenance of a minimum dollar amount of stockholders equity tangible net worth at redwood 
maintenance of a minimum dollar amount of cash and cash equivalents at redwood or maintenance of an amount of cash and cash equivalents in excess of a specified percentage of outstanding short term recourse indebtedness 
maintenance of a minimum ratio of consolidated recourse indebtedness to stockholders equity and tangible net worth at redwood 
maintenance of uncommitted residential loan warehouse facilities with a specified level of unused borrowing capacity 
securities repurchase facilities 
as noted above  another source of our short term debt financing is through secured borrowings under securities repurchase facilities we have established with various financial institution counterparties

maintenance of a minimum dollar amount of cash and cash equivalents at redwood 
maintenance of a minimum ratio of consolidated recourse indebtedness to consolidated adjusted tangible net worth at redwood 
committed line of credit 
as noted above  we also maintain a million committed line of short term credit from a bank  which is secured by our pledge of certain mortgage backed securities we own 
the types of financial covenants included in this bank line of credit are a subset of the covenants summarized above 
commercial debt investment repurchase facility 
as noted above  one source of our debt financing is secured borrowings under a commercial debt investment repurchase facility we have established with a financial institution counterparty

maintenance of a minimum dollar amount of cash and cash equivalents at redwood 
maintenance of a minimum ratio of consolidated recourse indebtedness to stockholders equity at redwood 
as noted above  at december   and through the date of this annual report on form k  we were in compliance with the financial covenants associated with our short term debt and other debt financing facilities 
in particular  with respect to i financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum dollar amount of stockholders equity or tangible net worth  at december  our level of stockholders equity and tangible net worth resulted in our being in compliance with these covenants by more than million  and ii financial covenants that require us to maintain recourse indebtedness below a specified ratio  at december  our level of recourse indebtedness resulted in our being in compliance with these covenants at a level such that we could incur at least billion in additional recourse indebtedness 
margin call provisions associated with short term debt and other debt financing residential loan warehouse facilities 
as noted above  one source of our short term debt financing is secured borrowings under residential loan warehouse facilities we have established with three different financial institution counterparties 
these 
table of contents warehouse facilities include the margin call provisions described below and during the three months ended december   and through the date of this annual report on form k  we complied with any margin calls received from creditors under these warehouse facilities if at any time the market value as determined by the creditor of any residential mortgage loan financed under a facility declines  then the creditor may demand that we transfer additional collateral to the creditor in the form of cash  us treasury obligations in certain cases  or additional residential mortgage loans with a value equal to the amount of the decline 
if we receive any such demand  i under three of our residential loan warehouse facilities  we would generally be required to transfer the additional collateral on the same day although demands received after a certain time would only require the transfer of additional collateral on the following business day and ii under one of our residential loan warehouse facilities  we would generally be required to transfer the additional collateral on the following business day 
the value of additional residential mortgage loans transferred as additional collateral is determined by the creditor 
securities repurchase facilities 
another source of our short term debt financing is through secured borrowings under securities repurchase facilities we have established with various financial institution counterparties 
these repurchase facilities include the margin call provisions described below and during the three months ended december   and through the date of this annual report on form k  we complied with any margin calls received from creditors under these repurchase facilities if at any time the market value as determined by the creditor of any securities financed under a facility declines  then the creditor may demand that we transfer additional collateral to the creditor in the form of cash  us treasury obligations  or additional securities with a value equal to the amount of the decline 
if we receive any such demand  we would generally be required to transfer the additional collateral on the same day 
the value of additional securities transferred as additional collateral is determined by the creditor 
committed line of credit 
as noted above  we also maintain a million committed line of short term credit from a bank  which is secured by our pledge of certain mortgage backed securities we own 
margin call provisions included in this bank line of credit are as follows and during the three months ended december   and through the date of this annual report on form k  we complied with any margin calls received from this creditor under this line of credit if at any time the total market value as determined by two broker dealers of the securities that are pledged as collateral under this facility declines to a value less than the outstanding amount of borrowings under this facility  then the creditor may demand that we transfer additional collateral to the creditor in the form of cash  us treasury obligations  or additional securities with a value equal to the amount of the difference 
if we receive any such demand  we would generally be required to transfer the additional collateral within two business days 
the value of additional collateral pledged is determined by the creditor 
commercial debt investment repurchase facility 
as noted above  one source of our debt financing is secured borrowings under a commercial debt investment repurchase facility we have established with a financial institution counterparty 
this facility includes the margin call provisions described below and during the three months ended december   and through the date of this annual report on form k  we complied with any margin calls received from the creditor under this facility if at any time the asset value as determined by the creditor of any commercial debt investment financed under the facility declines  then the creditor may demand that we transfer additional collateral to the creditor in the form of cash or additional commercial debt investments with a value equal to the amount of the decline 
if we receive any such demand  we would generally be required to transfer the additional collateral on the second business day thereafter although demands received after a certain time would allow an additional business day for the transfer of additional collateral to occur 
the value of additional commercial debt investments transferred as additional collateral is determined by the creditor 

table of contents results of operations taxable income the following table summarizes our taxable income loss and distributions to shareholders for the years ended december    and for each of these years  we had no undistributed reit taxable income 
table taxable income years ended december  in thousands est 
reit taxable income taxable reit subsidiary loss total taxable income loss distributions to shareholders our tax results for the year ended december  are estimates until we file tax returns for this year 
our estimated total taxable income for the year ended december  was million per share and included million in realized credit losses on investments 
this compared to taxable income for the year ended december   of million per share that included million in credit losses 
for the year ended december   our taxable loss was million per share and included million in credit losses 
taxable income distribution requirement as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income  after the application of federal net operating loss carryforwards nols  to our shareholders 
for  our estimated reit taxable income of million did not exceed our available nols  and therefore our minimum dividend distribution requirement was zero 
the following table details our federal nols and capital loss carryforwards available as of december  table federal net operating and capital loss carryforwards loss carryforward expiration by period in thousands to years to years to years years after years total reit loss carryforwards net operating loss capital loss total reit loss carryforwards trs loss carryforwards net operating loss capital loss total trs loss carryforwards as of december   we maintained million of nols at the reit level 
in order to utilize these carryforwards  taxable income must exceed our dividend distributions 
during  we distributed million to shareholders and exceeded our distribution requirement 
we do not expect to report any reit taxable income on our federal income tax return after the application of a dividends paid deduction 
as a result  we do not expect any of our federal nols at the reit level to be utilized in federal nols at the reit level do not expire until federal nols at the trs level expire between and federal capital loss carryforwards of million and million at the reit and trs  respectively  will expire between and in order to utilize these carryforwards  the respective entities must recognize capital gains in excess of capital losses before the expiration dates 
utilization of capital loss carryforwards by the reit reduces the reit s taxable income and distribution requirement 
capital loss carryforwards do not reduce the taxability of dividends to shareholders 

table of contents tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders for the year ended december   we declared and distributed four regular quarterly dividends totaling per share 
under the federal income tax rules applicable to reits  the taxable portion of any distribution to shareholders in excess of the minimum requirement is determined by i taxable income of the reit  exclusive of the dividends paid deduction and nols  and  ii net capital gains recognized by the reit  exclusive of capital loss carryforwards 
our dividend distributions are expected to be characterized for income tax purposes as ordinary income and return of capital 
thus  we expect approximately million of our dividend distributions to be characterized as ordinary income to shareholders  as this amount represents the taxable income we generated in prior to the application of a dividends paid deduction and nols in accordance with federal income tax rules 
of this amount  none is attributable to net capital gains recognized for tax purposes 
the remaining million of dividend distributions are expected to be characterized as a return of capital to shareholders and are generally not taxable 
a distribution of capital reduces the tax basis for common shares held by a shareholder at each quarterly distribution date provided the distribution does not exceed a shareholder s tax basis in our common shares 
in november  our board of directors announced its intention to pay a regular dividend of per share each quarter in differences between estimated taxable income and gaap income differences between estimated taxable income and gaap income are largely due to the following i we cannot establish loss reserves for future anticipated events for tax but can for gaap as realized credit losses are expensed when incurred for tax and these losses are anticipated through lower yields on assets or through loss provisions for gaap  ii the timing  and possibly the amount  of some expenses eg  compensation expenses are different for tax than for gaap  iii since amortization and impairments differ for tax and gaap  the tax and gaap gains and losses on sales may differ  resulting in differences in realized gains on sale  iv for tax  realized gains and losses from sales and the majority of income from mortgage banking activities are capital in nature  these realized capital gains may be offset by prior capital losses and are not reflected in taxable income  v unrealized gains and losses on market valuation adjustments of securities and derivatives are not recognized for tax until the instrument is sold or extinguished  and  vi for tax  we do not consolidate noncontrolling interests or securitization entities as we do under gaap 
as a result of these differences in accounting  our estimated taxable income can vary significantly from our gaap income during certain reporting periods 
the tax basis in assets and liabilities at the reit was billion and billion  respectively  at december  the gaap basis in assets and liabilities at the reit was billion and billion  respectively  at december  the primary difference in both the tax and gaap assets and liabilities is attributable to securitization entities that are consolidated for gaap reporting purposes but not for tax purposes 
the tables below reconcile our estimated taxable income to our gaap income for the years ended december    and table differences between estimated taxable income loss and gaap net income year ended december  in thousands  except per share data tax est

credit losses on securities and loans to determine estimated taxable income  we are generally not permitted to anticipate  or reserve for  credit losses on investments which are generally purchased at a discount 
for tax purposes  we accrue the entire purchase discount on a security into taxable income over the expected life of the security 
estimated taxable income is reduced when actual credit losses occur 
for gaap purposes  we establish a credit reserve and only accrete a portion of the purchase discount  if any  into income and write down securities that become impaired 
our income recognition is therefore faster for tax as compared to gaap  especially in the early years of owning a security when there are generally few credit losses 
at december   the cumulative difference between the gaap and tax amortized cost basis of our residential  commercial  and cdo subordinate securities excluding our investments in our securitization entities was million 
as we have no credit reserves or allowances for tax  any future credit losses on securities or loans will have a more significant impact on tax earnings than on gaap earnings and may create significant taxable income volatility to the extent the level of credit losses fluctuates during reporting periods 
during the years ended december  and  we realized million and million  respectively  of credit losses on securities for tax that we had previously provisioned for under gaap 
we anticipate that credit losses will continue to be a significant factor for determining taxable income 
credit losses are based on our tax basis  
table of contents which differs materially from our basis for gaap purposes 
we anticipate an additional million of credit losses for tax on securities  based on our projection of principal balance losses and assuming a similar tax basis as we have recently experienced  although the timing of actual losses is difficult to accurately project 
at december   for gaap we had a designated credit reserve of million on our securities  and an allowance for loan losses of million for our consolidated residential and commercial loans 
recognition of gains and losses on sale since amortization and impairments on assets differ for tax and gaap  the tax and gaap basis on assets sold or called may differ  resulting in differences in gains and losses on sale or call 
in addition  gains realized for tax may be offset by prior capital losses and  thus  not affect taxable income 
at december   the reit had an estimated million in capital loss carry forwards per share that can be used to offset future capital gains over the next three to five years 
since our intention is to generally invest in assets for the long term  it is difficult to anticipate when sales may occur and  thus  when or whether we might exhaust these capital loss carry forwards 
at december   we had an estimated million in capital loss carry forwards at the trs level 
since mortgage banking activities at the trs have generated net capital gains  we have been able to utilize some of the loss carryforwards at the trs 
prepayments on securities as part of our investment in sequoia securitization entities  we have retained ios at the time they are issued 
our tax basis in these securities was million at december   which includes a tax basis of million for ios retained from securitizations completed in and later 
the return on ios is sensitive to prepayments and  to the extent prepayments vary period to period  income from these ios will vary 
typically  fast prepayments reduce yields and slow prepayments increase yields 
we are not permitted to recognize a negative yield under tax accounting rules  so during periods of fast prepayments our periodic premium expense for tax purposes can be relatively low and the tax cost basis for these securities may not be significantly reduced 
in periods prior to  we experienced fast prepayments on the loans underlying our ios 
more recently  prepayments on sequoia entities issued prior to have been slow  and our tax basis is now below the fair values for these ios in the aggregate 
conversely  prepayments on our ios retained from securitizations completed in and later have been fast  resulting in a tax basis in excess of the fair values for these securities 
most of our sequoia securitizations are callable or will become callable over the next two years  although we do not currently anticipate any sequoia securitizations being called in the foreseeable future 
if a sequoia securitization is called  the remaining tax basis in the io is expensed  creating an ordinary loss at the call date 
prepayments also affect the taxable income recognition on other securities we own 
we are required to use particular prepayment assumptions for the remaining lives of each security 
as actual prepayment speeds vary  the yield we recognize for tax purposes will be adjusted accordingly 
thus  to the extent prepayments differ from our long term assumptions or vary from period to period  the yield recognized will also vary and this difference could be material for a specific security 
compensation expense the total tax expense for equity award compensation is dependent upon varying factors such as the timing of payments of dividend equivalent rights  the exercise of stock options  the distribution of deferred stock units and preferred stock units  and the cash deferrals to and withdrawals from our executive deferred compensation plan 
for gaap  the total expense associated with an equity award is determined at the award date and is recognized over the vesting period 
for tax  the total expense is recognized at the date of distribution or exercise  not the award date 
in addition  some compensation may not be deductible for tax if it exceeds certain levels and is not performance based 
thus  the total amount of compensation expense  as well as the timing  could be significantly different for tax than for gaap 
as an example  for gaap we expense the grant date fair value of performance stock units psus granted over the vesting term of those psus regardless of the degree to which the performance conditions for vesting are ultimately satisfied  if at all  whereas for tax the value of the psus that actually vest in accordance with the performance conditions of those awards and are subsequently distributed to the award recipient is recorded as an expense on the date of distribution 
if no psus under a particular grant ultimately vest  due to the failure to satisfy the performance conditions  no tax expense will be recorded for those psus  even though we would have already recorded expense for gaap equal to the grant date fair value of the psu awards 
conversely  if performance is such that a number of shares of common stock equal to of the psu award ultimately vest and are delivered to the award recipient  expense for tax will equal the common stock value on the date of distribution of of the number of psus originally granted 
this expense for tax could significantly exceed the recorded expense for gaap 

table of contents in addition  since the decision to exercise options or distribute deferred stock units  preferred stock units  or cash out of the executive deferred compensation plan is an employee s  it can be difficult to project when the tax expense will occur 
mortgage servicing rights for gaap purposes  we recognize msrs through the acquisition of servicing rights from third parties or through the retention of msrs associated with residential loans that we have acquired and subsequently transferred to third parties 
for tax purposes  basis in our msr assets is recognized through the acquisition of servicing rights from third parties  or to the extent that the msr entitles us to receive a servicing fee that is in excess of a safe harbor amount prescribed by the internal revenue service 
no tax basis in our msr assets has been recognized to date 
for gaap purposes  mortgage servicing fee income  net of servicing expense and changes in the estimated fair value of our msrs  is recognized on our consolidated income statement over the life of the msr asset 
for tax purposes  only mortgage servicing fee income  net of servicing expense is recognized as taxable income 
tax basis in our msr assets is not recognized when msrs are retained from transfers of loans to sequoia securitization entities or to third parties thereby creating a temporary gaap to tax difference on the gain from sale 
any msr where basis is recognized for tax purposes through acquisition is amortized as a tax expense over a finite life 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a discussion of critical accounting policies and the possible effects of changes in estimates on our financial statements is included in note summary of significant accounting policies included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks we seek to manage risks inherent in our business including but not limited to credit risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  liquidity risk  and fair value risk in a prudent manner designed to enhance our earnings and dividends and preserve our capital 
in general  we seek to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with these risks 
this section presents a general overview of these risks 
additional information concerning the risks we are managing  how these risks are changing over time  and potential gaap earnings and taxable income volatility we may experience as a result of these risks is further discussed in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
credit risk integral to our business is assuming credit risk through our ownership of residential and commercial loans and securities as well as through our reliance on business counterparties 
we believe the securities and loans we purchase are priced to generate an expected return that compensates us for the underlying credit risk associated with these investments 
nevertheless  there may be significant credit losses associated with these investments should they perform worse than we expect on a credit basis 
we manage our credit risks by analyzing the extent of the risk we are taking and reviewing whether we believe the appropriate underwriting criteria are met  and we utilize systems and staff to monitor the ongoing credit performance of our loans and securities 
to the extent we find the credit risks on specific assets are changing adversely  we may be able to take actions  such as selling the affected investments  to mitigate potential losses 
however  we may not always be successful in analyzing risks  reviewing underwriting criteria  foreseeing adverse changes in credit performance or in effectively mitigating future credit losses and the ability to sell an asset may be limited due to the structure of the asset or the absence of a liquid market for the asset 
residential loans and securities our residential loans and securities backed by residential loans are generally secured by real property 
credit losses on real estate loans and securities can occur for many reasons  including poor origination practices  fraud  faulty appraisals  documentation errors  poor underwriting  legal errors  poor servicing practices  weak economic conditions  decline in the value of homes  businesses  or commercial properties  special hazards  earthquakes and other natural events  over leveraging of the borrower or on the property  reduction in market rents and occupancies and poor property management practices  changes in legal protections for lenders  reduction in personal incomes  job loss  and personal events such as divorce or health problems 
in addition  if the us economy or the housing market were to weaken and that weakening was in excess of what we anticipated  credit losses could increase beyond levels that we have anticipated 
with respect to most of the loans securitized by securitization entities sponsored by us and for a portion of the loans underlying residential loan securities we have acquired from securitizations sponsored by others  the interest rate is adjustable 
accordingly  when short term interest rates rise  required monthly payments from homeowners may rise under the terms of these loans  and this may increase borrowers delinquencies and defaults that can lead to additional credit losses 
we also own some securities backed by alt a quality loans and  to a lesser degree  some backed by subprime loans that have substantially higher credit risk characteristics than prime quality loans 
consequently  we can expect these lower quality loans to have higher rates of delinquency and loss  and if such losses differ from our assumptions  we could incur credit losses 
in addition  we invest in riskier loan types with the potential for higher delinquencies and losses as compared to regular amortization loans  but believe these securities offer us the opportunity to generate attractive risk adjusted returns as a result of attractive pricing and the manner in which these securitizations are structured 
nevertheless  there remains substantial uncertainty about the future performance of these assets 

table of contents commercial loans and securities the commercial loans we invest in are typically fixed rate loans  the majority of which are interest only loans that are generally subordinate to senior lien holders and are backed by a transaction sponsor or borrowing entity and not real property 
the commercial securities we invest in are typically subordinate securities backed by first lien commercial loans that credit enhance more senior securities backed by the same loans and may thus expose us to a more concentrated credit risk than other investors 
in general  the loans we invest in or the loans backing securities that we credit enhance require balloon payments at maturity 
consequently  we could be exposed to credit losses at the maturity of these loans if the borrower is unable to repay or refinance the borrowing with another third party lender 
the ability of the borrower to pay us back at maturity is a function of the cash flows generated on the commercial property  as well as the general level of interest rates 
if interest rates rise to an extent that the cash flows on the property are insufficient to cover a new loan that is sufficient to pay off our loan  we would be subject to credit losses at maturity 
in addition  we originate commercial loans secured by first liens on commercial real estate with the intention to sell these loans or securitize them within a relatively short period of time following origination 
between the time of origination and the time of sale or securitization of these senior loans we are exposed to credit risk associated with these loans 
in addition  we may  in some circumstances  invest in a subordinate security issued in a securitization transaction that includes one or more senior loans we originated  in which case we would continue to be exposed to credit risk with respect to these and other loans included in that securitization through our ownership of those subordinate securities 
counterparties we are also exposed to credit risk with respect to our business and lender counterparties 
for example  counterparties we acquire loans from  lend to  or invest in  make representations and warranties and covenants to us  and may also indemnify us against certain losses 
to the extent we have suffered a loss and are entitled to enforce those agreements to recover damages  if our counterparties are insolvent or unable or unwilling to comply with these agreements we would suffer a loss due to the credit risk associated with our counterparties 
as an example  under short term borrowing facilities and swap and other derivative agreements  we sometimes transfer assets as collateral to our counterparties 
to the extent a counterparty is not able to return this collateral to us if and when we are entitled to its return  we could suffer a loss due to the credit risk associated with that counterparty 
in addition  because we rely on the availability of credit under committed and uncommitted borrowing facilities to fund our business and investments  our counterparties willingness and ability to extend credit to us under these facilities is a significant counterparty risk and is discussed further below under the heading fair value and liquidity risks 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can affect the cash flows and fair values of our assets  liabilities  and derivative financial instruments and  consequently  affect our earnings and reported equity 
our general strategy with respect to interest rates is to maintain an asset liability posture including hedges on a consolidated basis that assumes some interest rate risks but not to such a degree that the achievement of our long term goals would likely be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  we are willing to accept short term volatility of earnings and changes in our reported equity in order to accomplish our goal of achieving attractive long term returns 
to implement our interest rate risk strategy  we may use derivative financial instruments in an effort to maintain a close match between pledged assets and debt  as well as between the interest rate characteristics of the assets in the securitization entities and the corresponding abs issued 
however  we generally do not attempt to completely hedge changes in interest rates  and at times  we may be subject to more interest rate risk than we generally desire in the long term 
changes in interest rates will have an impact on the values and cash flows of our assets and corresponding liabilities 
prepayment risk prepayment risks exist in the assets and associated liabilities consolidated on our balance sheets 
in general  discount securities benefit from faster prepayment rates on the underlying real estate loans while premium securities such as ios benefit from slower prepayments on the underlying loans 
we note that changes in residential loan prepayment rates could result in gaap and tax earnings volatility 

table of contents we caution that prepayment rates are difficult to predict or anticipate  and variations in prepayment rates can materially affect our earnings and dividend distribution requirements 
arm prepayment rates  for example  are driven by many factors  one of which is the steepness of the yield curve 
as the yield curve flattens short term interest rates rise relative to longer term interest rates  arm prepayments typically increase 
however  for borrowers who have impaired credit or who otherwise do not meet loan underwriting criteria  the ability to refinance ie  prepay a loan even when interest rates decline may be limited 
inflation risk virtually all of our consolidated assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates and other factors drive our performance more directly than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
separately  inflation or deflation in home prices can affect our credit risk 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
our activities and balance sheets are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation 
fair value and liquidity risks to fund our assets we may use a variety of debt alternatives in addition to equity capital that present us with fair value and liquidity risks 
we seek to manage these risks  including by maintaining what we believe to be adequate cash and capital levels 
most residential loans we invest in are accumulated and sold to sequoia securitization entities and thus  changes in the fair value of the loans  once securitized do not have an impact on our liquidity 
however  changes in fair values during the accumulation period while these loans are typically funded with short term debt before they are sold to a sequoia entity may have a short term effect on our liquidity 
we may also own some real estate loans accounted for as held for sale and adverse changes in their value may be recognized through our income statement and may have an impact on our ability to obtain financing for them 
most of the securities we invest in are funded with a combination of equity capital  secured financing or short term debt facilities 
to the extent we use equity capital or secured financing  we can reduce our liquidity risks  however  we would still be exposed to adverse changes in fair value of these securities as a result of changes in overall market liquidity 
for the securities we acquire with a combination of equity capital and short term debt  we would be exposed to liquidity risk to the extent the values of these investments decline and or the counterparties we use to finance these investments adversely change our borrowing requirements 
we attempt to mitigate our liquidity risk from short term financing facilities by setting aside adequate capital 
under short term borrowing facilities  interest rate swaps and other derivatives agreements  we pledge assets as security for our payment obligations and make various representations and warranties and agree to certain covenants  events of default  and other terms 
in addition  our short term borrowing facilities are generally uncommitted  meaning that each time we request a new borrowing under a facility the lender has the option to decline to extend credit to us 
the terms of these facilities and agreements typically include financial covenants such as covenants to maintain a minimum amount of tangible net worth or stockholders equity and or a minimum amount of liquid assets  margin requirements which typically require us to pledge additional collateral if and when the value of previously pledged collateral declines  operating covenants such as covenants to conduct our business in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and covenants to provide notice of certain events to creditors  representations and warranties such as representations and warranties relating to characteristics of pledged collateral  our exposure to litigation and or regulatory enforcement actions and the absence of material adverse changes to our financial condition  our operations  or our business prospects  and events of default such as a breach of covenant or representation warranty and cross defaults  under which an event of default is triggered under a credit facility if an event of default or similar event occurs under another credit facility 

table of contents quantitative information on market risk our future earnings are sensitive to a number of market risk factors and changes in these factors may have a variety of secondary effects that  in turn  will also impact our earnings and equity 
to supplement the discussion above of the market risks we face  the following table incorporates information that may be useful in analyzing certain market risks that may affect our consolidated balance sheets at december  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of repayment 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets at december   was used to project the average coupon rates for each year presented 
the timing of principal cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of assets based on their recent prepayment performance and future prepayment performance consistent with the forward curve 
our future results depend greatly on the credit performance of the underlying loans this table assumes no credit losses  future interest rates  prepayments  and our ability to invest our existing cash and future cash flow
