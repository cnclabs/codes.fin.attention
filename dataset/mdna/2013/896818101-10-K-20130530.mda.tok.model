item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
overview we are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have three operating segments i triumph aerostructures group  whose companies revenues are derived from the design  manufacture  assembly and integration of metallic and composite aerostructures and structural components for the global aerospace original equipment manufacturers  or oem  market  ii triumph aerospace systems group  whose companies design  engineer and manufacture a wide range of proprietary and build to print components  assemblies and systems also for the oem market  and iii triumph aftermarket services group  whose companies serve aircraft fleets  notably commercial airlines  the us military and cargo carriers  through the maintenance  repair and overhaul of aircraft components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
effective march   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  triumph engine control systems  llc  acquired the assets of goodrich corporation goodrich pump engine control systems gpecs  a leading independent aerospace fuel system supplier for the commercial  military  helicopter and business jet markets 
the acquisition of gpecs provides new capabilities in a market where we did not previously participate and further diversifies our customer base in electronic engine controls  fuel metering units and main fuel pumps for both oem and aftermarket spares end markets 
the results for triumph engine control systems  llc are included in the aerospace systems group segment from the date of acquisition 
effective december   the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of embee  inc embee  renamed triumph processing embee division  inc  which is a leading commercial metal finishing provider offering more than seventy metal finishing  inspecting and testing processes primarily for the aerospace industry 
the acquisition of embee expands our current capabilities to provide comprehensive processing services on precision engineered parts for hydraulics  landing gear  spare parts and electronic actuation systems 
the results for triumph processing embee division  inc are included in the aerospace systems group segment from the date of acquisition 
the acquisitions of gpecs and embee are collectively referred to hereafter as the fiscal acquisitions 
financial highlights for the fiscal year ended march  include net sales for fiscal increased to billion  including an increase due to organic growth 
operating income in fiscal increased to million 
non gaap operating income excluding curtailments and early retirement incentives for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  increase of million  or 
net income for fiscal increased to million 
backlog increased over the prior year to billion 
for the fiscal year ended march   backlog increased substantially from what we had previously reported 
during our fiscal fourth quarter  we detected an inadvertent error in how one portion of our month backlog was being reported 
for the fiscal year ended march   net sales totaled billion  an increase from fiscal year net sales of billion 
net income for fiscal year increased to million  or per diluted common share  versus million  or per diluted common share  for fiscal year as discussed in further detail below under results of operations  the increase in net income is attributable to the increase in sales offset by the curtailments and early retirement incentives of million 
our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
for the fiscal year ended march   we generated million of cash flows from operating activities  used million in investing activities and received million from financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities in fiscal year included million in pension contributions versus million in fiscal year we continue to remain focused on growing our core businesses as well as growing through strategic acquisitions 
our organic sales increased in fiscal due to continuing improvement to the overall economy  increased build rates by boeing and airbus  increased passenger traffic from previously depressed levels and mro market share gain 
our company has an aggressive but selective acquisition approach that adds capabilities and increases our capacity for strong and consistent internal growth 

table of contents congress and the administration failed to change or further delay the sequestration of appropriations in government fiscal year gfy imposed by budget control act of budget act and sequestration went into effect on march  our customers budgets will be reduced significantly and there may be a direct significant reduction in our customers contract awards 
while we understand customers have started to plan for sequestration  the specific effects of sequestration are not yet available and cannot be determined by us 
the automatic across the board cuts from sequestration will approximately double the amount of the ten year billion reduction in defense spending that began in gfy already required by the budget act  including the budget for overseas contingencies operations and any unobligated balances from prior years  and would have significant consequences to our business and industry 
non dod agencies could also have significantly reduced budgets 
it is likely there will be some disruption of our ongoing programs  impacts to our supply chain and contractual actions including partial or complete terminations 
consequently  we expect that sequestration  or other budgetary cuts in lieu of sequestration  will have a negative effect on our corporation 
in fiscal  we began efforts to establish a new facility in red oak  texas to expand our manufacturing capacity  particularly under the bombardier global program 
in fiscal  we started construction on a second facility in association with our relocation from our jefferson street facilities 
as of march   we have incurred approximately million in capital expenditures and million in inventory costs associated with the bombardier global program  for which we have not yet begun to deliver 
on may   the company acquired four related entities collectively comprising the primus composites business from precision castparts corp 
the acquired business  which includes two manufacturing facilities in farnborough  england and rayong  thailand  will operate as triumph structures farnborough and triumph structures thailand and be included in the aerostructures group 
together  triumph structures farnsborough and triumph structures thailand constitute a global supplier of composite and metallic propulsion and structural composites and assemblies 
in addition to its composite operations  the thailand operation also machines and processes metal components 
primus composites employs approximately employees 
results of operations the following includes a discussion of our consolidated and business segment results of operations 
the company diverse structure and customer base do not provide for precise comparisons of the impact of price and volume changes to our results 
however  we have disclosed the significant variances between the respective periods 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission the sec guidance on compliance and disclosure interpretations  we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures in our public releases 
currently  the non gaap financial measure that we disclose is adjusted ebitda  which is our income from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  amortization of acquired contract liabilities  curtailments and early retirement incentives and depreciation and amortization 
we disclose adjusted ebitda on a consolidated and a reportable segment basis in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the sec 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 
we view adjusted ebitda as an operating performance measure and  as such  we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is income from continuing operations 
in calculating adjusted ebitda  we exclude from income from continuing operations the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity  as an alternative to net income loss  income from continuing operations  or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on adjusted ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure  including net income loss or income from continuing operations 
in addition  we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to income from continuing operations set forth below  in our earnings releases and in other filings with the sec and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k that are filed with the sec  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our adjusted ebitda 

table of contents adjusted ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
we have spent more than years expanding our product and service capabilities partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
due to the expansion of our operations  which included acquisitions  our income from continuing operations has included significant charges for depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from charges for depreciation and amortization 
we believe the disclosure of adjusted ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also believe adjusted ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization  and non operating items  such as interest and income taxes  provides additional information about our cost structure  and  over time  helps track our operating progress 
in addition  investors  securities analysts and others have regularly relied on adjusted ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our income from continuing operations to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to income from continuing operations curtailments and early retirement incentives may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the current period impact of the change in the defined benefit obligation due to the reduction in future service costs as well as the incremental cost of retirement incentive benefits paid to participants 
we do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations 
amortization of acquired contract liabilities may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the non cash earnings on the fair value of off market contracts acquired through acquisitions 
we do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations 
amortization expense may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of product rights and licenses 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
depreciation may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of interest expense and other we incur may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows 
however  we do not consider the amount of interest expense and other to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
income tax expense may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business 
however  we do not consider the amount of income tax expense to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap measures by using a non gaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

business segment performance we report our financial performance based on the following three reportable segments the aerostructures group  the aerospace systems group and the aftermarket services group 
the company chief operating decision maker codm utilizes adjusted ebitda as a primary measure of profitability to evaluate performance of its segments and allocate resources 
the results of operations among our reportable segments vary due to differences in competitors  customers  extent of proprietary deliverables and performance 
for example  our aerostructures segment generally includes long term sole source or preferred supplier contracts and the success of these programs provides a strong foundation for our business and positions us well for future growth on new programs and new derivatives 
this compares to our aerospace systems segment which generally includes proprietary products and or arrangements where we become the primary source or one of a few primary sources to our customers  where our unique manufacturing capabilities command a higher margin 
also  oems are increasingly focusing on assembly activities while outsourcing more manufacturing and repair to third parties  and as a result  are less of a competitive force than in previous years 
in contrast  our aftermarket services segment provides mro services on components and accessories manufactured by third parties  with more diverse competition  including airlines  oems and other third party service providers 
in addition  variability in the timing and extent of customer requests performed in the aftermarket services segment can provide for greater volatility and less predictability in revenue and earnings than that experienced in the aerostructures and aerospace systems segments 

table of contents the aerostructures segment consists of the company operations that manufacture products primarily for the aerospace oem market 
the aerostructures segment revenues are derived from the design  manufacture  assembly and integration of both build to print and proprietary metallic and composite aerostructures and structural components  including aircraft wings  fuselage sections  tail assemblies  engine nacelles  flight control surfaces as well as helicopter cabins 
further  the segment operations also design and manufacture composite assemblies for floor panels and environmental control system ducts 
these products are sold to various aerospace oems on a global basis 
the aerospace systems segment consists of the company operations that also manufacture products primarily for the aerospace oem market 
the segment operations design a wide range of proprietary and build to print components and engineer mechanical and electromechanical controls  such as hydraulic systems  main engine gearbox assemblies  engine control systems  accumulators  mechanical control cables  non structural cockpit components and metal processing 
these products are sold to various aerospace oems on a global basis 
the aftermarket services segment consists of the company operations that provide maintenance  repair and overhaul services to both commercial and military markets on components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
maintenance  repair and overhaul revenues are derived from services on auxiliary power units  airframe and engine accessories  including constant speed drives  cabin compressors  starters and generators  and pneumatic drive units 
in addition  the segment operations repair and overhaul thrust reversers  nacelle components and flight control surfaces 
the segment operations also perform repair and overhaul services and supply spare parts for various types of gauges for a broad range of commercial airlines on a worldwide basis 
we currently generate a majority of our revenue from clients in the commercial aerospace industry  the military  the business jet industry and the regional airline industry 
our growth and financial results are largely dependent on continued demand for our products and services from clients in these industries 
if any of these industries experiences a downturn  our clients in these sectors may conduct less business with us 
the following table summarizes our net sales by end market by business segment 
the loss of one or more of our major customers or an economic downturn in the commercial airline or the military and defense markets could have a material adverse effect on our business

we recently have experienced a slight decrease in our military end market 
due to the continued strength in the commercial aerospace end market and the planned reductions in defense spending under the budget act and the sequestration discussed above  we expect the declining trend in the military end market to continue

the contingent interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal per annum calculated on the average trading price of a note for the relevant five trading day period 
this contingent interest feature represents an embedded derivative 
the value of the derivative was determined to be de minimis 
accordingly  no value has been assigned at issuance or at march  the convertible notes mature on october  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
the company may redeem the convertible notes for cash  either in whole or in part  anytime on or after october  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  up to but not including the date of redemption 
in addition  holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require the company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their convertible notes on october   and  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  up to  but not including  the date of repurchase 
the convertible notes are convertible into the company common stock at a rate equal to shares per principal amount of the convertible notes equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment as described in the indenture 
upon conversion  the company will deliver to the holder surrendering the convertible notes for conversion  for each principal amount of convertible notes  an amount consisting of cash equal to the lesser of and the company total conversion obligation and  to the extent that the company total conversion obligation exceeds  at the company election  cash or shares of the company common stock in respect of the remainder 
the convertible notes are eligible for conversion upon meeting certain conditions as provided in the indenture agreement 
for the periods from january  through march   the convertible notes were eligible for conversion 
in march and april  the company received notice of conversion from holders of million in principal value of the convertible notes 
these conversions were settled in first quarter of fiscal with the principal settled in cash and the conversion benefit settled through the issuance of approximately  shares 
in april  the company delivered a notice to holders of the convertible notes to the effect that  for at least trading days during the consecutive trading days preceding march   the closing price of the company common stock was greater than or equal to of the conversion price of such notes on the last trading day 
under the terms of the convertible notes  the increase in the company stock price triggered a provision  which gave holders of the convertible notes a put option through june  accordingly  the balance sheet classification of the convertible notes will be short term for as long as the put option remains in effect 
to be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  the average price of the company common stock for the fiscal year must exceed the conversion price per share of 
the average price of the company common stock for the fiscal years ended march   and was  and  respectively

during the fiscal year ended march   the company committed to relocate the operations of its largest facility in dallas  tx and to expand its red oak  texas red oak facility to accommodate this relocation 
the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended march  associated with this plan  and expects total capital expenditures to be between approximately million to million related to the expansion of red oak 
the company incurred approximately million of expenses related to the relocation during fiscal year and expects to incur approximately million to million for the fiscal year end march  the relocation is expected to be completed in early fiscal in addition to the financial obligations detailed in the table above  we also had obligations related to our benefit plans at march  as detailed in the following table

table of contents current plan documents reserve our right to amend or terminate the plans at any time  subject to applicable collective bargaining requirements for represented employees 
we believe that cash generated by operations and borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations for the foreseeable future 
however  we have a stated policy to grow through acquisitions and are continuously evaluating various acquisition opportunities 
as a result  we currently are pursuing the potential purchase of a number of candidates 
in the event that more than one of these transactions is successfully consummated  the availability under the credit facility might be fully utilized and additional funding sources may be needed 
there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on terms favorable to us  if at all

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the appropriate allowance  we consider a combination of factors  such as industry trends  our customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
the calculation of the required allowance requires a judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
inventories the company records inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
costs on long term contracts and programs in progress represent recoverable costs incurred for production or contract specific facilities and equipment  allocable operating overhead and advances to suppliers 
pursuant to contract provisions  agencies of the us government and certain other customers have title to  or a security interest in  inventories related to such contracts as a result of advances  performance based payments  and progress payments 
the company reflects those advances and payments as an offset against the related inventory balances 
the company expenses general and administrative costs related to products and services provided essentially under commercial terms and conditions as incurred 
the company determines the costs of inventories by the first in  first out or average cost methods 
advance payments and progress payments received on contracts in process are first offset against related contract costs that are included in inventory  with any remaining amount reflected in current liabilities 
work in process inventory includes capitalized pre production costs 
company policy allows for the capitalization of pre production costs after it establishes a contractual arrangement with a customer that explicitly states that the cost of recovery of pre production costs is allowed 
capitalized pre production costs include nonrecurring engineering  planning and design  including applicable overhead  incurred before production is manufactured on a regular basis 
significant customer directed work changes can also cause pre production costs to be incurred 
these costs are typically recovered over a contractually determined number of ship set deliveries and the company believes these amounts will be fully recovered 
the balance of capitalized pre production costs at march  was million 
we are still in the early development stages for the 
table of contents bombardier global program  as these aircrafts are not scheduled to enter service until or later 
transition of this program from development to recurring production levels is dependent upon the success of the program at achieving flight testing and certification  as well as the ability of the bombardier global program to generate acceptable levels of aircraft sales 
revenue and profit recognition revenues are recognized in accordance with the contract terms when products are shipped  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
a significant portion of our contracts are within the scope of accounting standards codification asc  revenue construction type and production type contracts  and revenue and costs on contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
accounting for the revenue and profit on a contract requires estimates of the contract value or total contract revenue  the total costs at completion  which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract scope of work and the measurement of progress towards completion 
depending on the contract  we measure progress toward completion using either the cost to cost method or the units of delivery method  with the great majority measured under the units of delivery method 
under the cost to cost method  progress toward completion is measured as the ratio of total costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion 
we recognize costs as incurred 
profit is determined based on our estimated profit margin on the contract multiplied by our progress toward completion 
revenue represents the sum of our costs and profit on the contract for the period 
under the units of delivery method  revenue on a contract is recorded as the units are delivered and accepted during the period at an amount equal to the contractual selling price of those units 
the costs recorded on a contract under the units of delivery method are equal to the total costs at completion divided by the total units to be delivered 
as our contracts can span multiple years  we often segment the contracts into production lots for the purposes of accumulating and allocating cost 
profit is recognized as the difference between revenue for the units delivered and the estimated costs for the units delivered 
adjustments to original estimates for a contract revenues  estimated costs at completion and estimated total profit are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
these estimates are also sensitive to the assumed rate of production 
generally  the longer it takes to complete the contract quantity  the more relative overhead that contract will absorb 
the impact of revisions in cost estimates is recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they become evident forward losses and are first offset against costs that are included in inventory  with any remaining amount reflected in accrued contract liabilities in accordance with asc revisions in contract estimates  if significant  can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows  as well as our valuation of inventory 
furthermore  certain contracts are combined or segmented for revenue recognition in accordance with asc for the fiscal year ended march   cumulative catch up adjustments resulting from changes in estimates decreased operating income  net income and earnings per share by approximately million  million and  respectively 
the cumulative catch up adjustments to operating income for the fiscal year ended march  included gross favorable adjustments of approximately million and gross unfavorable adjustments of approximately million 
for the fiscal year ended march   cumulative catch up adjustments resulting from changes in estimates increased operating income  net income and earnings per share by approximately million  million and  respectively 
the cumulative catch up adjustments to operating income for the fiscal year ended march  included gross favorable adjustments of approximately million and gross unfavorable adjustments of approximately million 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are only included in revenue when such change orders or claims have been settled with our customer and to the extent that units have been delivered 
additionally  some contracts may contain provisions for revenue sharing  price re determination  requests for equitable adjustments  change orders or cost and or performance incentives 
such amounts or incentives are included in contract value when the amounts can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured 
although fixed price contracts  which extend several years into the future  generally permit us to keep unexpected profits if costs are less than projected  we also bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause the company to sustain losses on the contract 
in a fixed price contract  we must fully absorb cost overruns  notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts and in projecting the ultimate level of revenue that may otherwise be achieved 

table of contents our failure to anticipate technical problems  estimate delivery reductions  estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixed price contract may reduce the profitability of a fixed price contract or cause a loss 
we believe we have recorded adequate provisions in the financial statements for losses on fixed price contracts  but we cannot be certain that the contract loss provisions will be adequate to cover all actual future losses 
included in net sales of the aerostructures group is the non cash amortization of acquired contract liabilities recognized as fair value adjustments through purchase accounting of the acquisition of vought 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 
the aftermarket services group provides repair and overhaul services  certain of which are provided under long term power by the hour contracts  comprising approximately of the segment fiscal net sales 
the company applies the proportional performance method to recognize revenue under these contracts 
revenue is recognized over the contract period as units are delivered based on the relative value in proportion to the total estimated contract consideration 
in estimating the total contract consideration  management evaluates the projected utilization of its customer fleet over the term of the contract  in connection with the related estimated repair and overhaul servicing requirements to the fleet based on such utilization 
changes in utilization of the fleet by customers  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates and require adjustments to estimates of revenue to be realized 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
additionally  intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
upon acquisition  critical estimates are made in valuing acquired intangible assets  which include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  and estimating cash flows from projects when completed  tradename and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time that customer relationships will continue  and discount rates 
management estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from the assumptions used in determining fair values 
the company operating segments of aerostructures  aerospace systems and aftermarket services are also its reporting units under asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer comprise the company codm 
the company codm evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon review of segment information 
each of the operating segments is comprised of a number of operating units which are considered to be components under asc the components  for which discrete financial information exists  are aggregated for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the company acquisition strategy is to acquire companies that complement and enhance the capabilities of the operating segments of the company 
each acquisition is assigned to either the aerostructures reporting unit  the aerospace systems reporting unit or the aftermarket services reporting unit 
the goodwill that results from each acquisition is also assigned to the reporting unit to which the acquisition is allocated  because it is that reporting unit which is intended to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
the company assesses whether goodwill impairment exists using both the qualitative and quantitative assessments 
the qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if based on this qualitative assessment  the company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if the company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment  a quantitative assessment is performed using a two step approach required by asc to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit 
the first step of the quantitative test is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being applied to goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses at least annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates and require interim impairment assessments 
when performing the two step quantitative impairment test  the company methodology includes the use of an income approach which discounts future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects the company cost of capital  otherwise known as the discounted cash flow method dcf 
these estimated fair values are based on estimates of future cash flows of the businesses 
factors affecting these future cash flows include the continued market acceptance of the products 
table of contents and services offered by the businesses  the development of new products and services by the businesses and the underlying cost of development  the future cost structure of the businesses  and future technological changes 
the company also incorporates market multiples for comparable companies in determining the fair value of our reporting units 
any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified 
we incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result of our annual goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years  or in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the qualitative assessment performed for each of the company indefinite lived intangible assets indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded its carrying amount and  therefore  the quantitative assessment was not performed 
as of march  and  the company had a million and million indefinite lived intangible asset associated with the vought and embee tradenames 
the company assesses whether indefinite lived intangible assets impairment exists using both the qualitative and quantitative assessments 
the qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
if based on this qualitative assessment the company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount or if the company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment  a quantitative assessment is performed to determine whether an indefinite lived intangible asset impairment exists 
we test the indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair value based on current revenue projections of the related operations  under the relief from royalty method 
any excess carry value over the amount of fair value is recognized as an impairment 
we incurred no impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our annual indefinite lived intangible assets impairment tests in fiscal years  or in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the qualitative assessment performed for each of the company three reporting units indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  including indefinite lived intangible assets  and  therefore  the quantitative assessment was not performed 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
intangible assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment 
when factors indicate that long lived assets  including intangible assets  should be evaluated for possible impairment  an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets  including intangible assets  is used to measure recoverability 
some of the more important factors we consider include our financial performance relative to our expected and historical performance  significant changes in the way we manage our operations  negative events that have occurred  and negative industry and economic trends 
if the carrying amount is less than the estimated fair value  measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset group  generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
during the fiscal year ended march   a million favorable fair value adjustment was recorded due to the reduction of the fair value of a contingent earnout liability associated with a prior acquisition due to changes in the projected earnings over the respective earnout periods 
the company also considered these changes in projected earnings to be an indicator of impairment of the long lived assets directly related to this acquisition and  as a result  tested these long lived assets for recoverability and concluded that the asset group was recoverable 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  there were no reductions to the remaining useful lives and no write downs of long lived assets  including intangible assets  were required 
acquired contract liabilities  net in connection with our acquisition of vought  we assumed existing long term contracts 
based on our review of these contracts  we concluded that the terms of certain contracts to be either more or less favorable than could be realized in market transactions as of the date of the acquisition 
as a result  we recognized acquired contract liabilities  net of acquired contract assets of million at the acquisition date of vought based on the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows of the executory contracts and the estimated cash flows had the contracts been executed at the acquisition date 
the liabilities principally relate to long term life of program contracts that were initially executed by vought over years ago  as well as loss contracts for which vought had recognized significant pre acquisition contract loss reserves 
in connection with our acquisition of gpecs  we assumed existing long term contracts 
based on our review of the long term contracts of gpecs  we concluded that the terms of certain contracts to be either more or less favorable than could be realized in market transactions as of the date of the acquisition 
as a result  we recognized provisional acquired contract 
table of contents liabilities  net of acquired contract assets of million at the acquisition date based on the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows of the executory contracts and the estimated cash flows had the contracts been executed at the acquisition date 
we measured these net liabilities under the measurement provisions of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  which is based on the price to transfer the obligation to a market participants at the measurement date  assuming that the net liabilities will remain outstanding in the marketplace 
the liabilities principally relate to long term life of program contracts were initially executed by gpecs years ago 
these net liabilities will be amortized in accordance with the underlying economic pattern of obligations  as reflected by the net cash outflows incurred on the long term contracts assumed 
as we finalize the fair value of acquired long term contracts  additional purchase price adjustments will be recorded during the measurement period during fiscal fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
the judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each long term contracts can materially impact our results of operations 
the finalization of the purchase accounting assessment will result in changes in the valuation of the long term contracts and may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
the acquired contract liabilities  net for vought and gpecs are being amortized as non cash revenues over the terms of the respective contracts 
the company recognized net amortization of contract liabilities of approximately million  million and million in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  and such amounts have been included in revenues in our results of operations 
the balance of the liability as of march  is approximately million and  based on the expected delivery schedule of the underlying contracts  the company estimates annual amortization of the liability as follows million  million  million  million  million  thereafter million 
postretirement plans the liabilities and net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of asset return  the assumed average rate of compensation increase and rate of growth for medical costs 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate these costs are reviewed annually or when a remeasurement is necessary 
assumptions are based upon management best estimates  after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries  as of the measurement date 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based on a point in time estimate as of our annual measurement date or as of remeasurement dates as needed 
this rate is determined based upon a review of yield rates associated with long term  high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date and use of models that discount projected benefit payments using the spot rates developed from the yields on selected long term  high quality corporate bonds 
the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor 
the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required 
the discount rate at march  decreased to from at march  the assumed expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation pbo 
the expected average long term rate of return on assets is based on several factors including actual historical market index returns  anticipated long term performance of individual asset classes with consideration given to the related investment strategy  plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns 
this rate is utilized principally in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year differs from the assumed rate  that year annual pension expense is not affected 
the gain or loss reduces or increases future pension expense over the average remaining service period of active plan participants expected to receive benefits 
the expected long term rate of return for fiscal and  respectively  is  compared to for fiscal the assumed average rate of compensation increase represents the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees 
this rate is utilized principally in calculating the pbo and annual pension expense 
in addition to our defined benefit pension plans  we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired employees 
such benefits are unfunded as of march  employees achieve eligibility to participate in these contributory plans upon retirement from active service if they meet specified age and years of service requirements 
election to participate for eligible employees must be made at the date of retirement 
qualifying dependents at the date of retirement are also eligible for medical coverage 
current plan documents reserve our right to amend or terminate the plans at any time  subject to applicable collective bargaining requirements for represented employees 
from time to time  we have made changes to the benefits provided to various groups of plan participants 
premiums charged to most retirees for medical coverage prior to 
table of contents age are based on years of service and are adjusted annually for changes in the cost of the plans as determined by an independent actuary 
in addition to this medical inflation cost sharing feature  the plans also have provisions for deductibles  co payments  coinsurance percentages  out of pocket limits  schedules of reasonable fees  preferred provider networks  coordination of benefits with other plans  and a medicare carve out 
in accordance with the asc  compensation retirement benefits topic of the asc  we recognized the funded status of our benefit obligation 
this funded status is remeasured as of our annual remeasurement date 
the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the pbo or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of the plan 
in order to recognize the funded status  we determined the fair value of the plan assets 
the majority of our plan assets are publicly traded investments which were valued based on the market price as of the date of remeasurement 
investments that are not publicly traded were valued based on the estimated fair value of those investments as of the remeasurement date based on our evaluation of data from fund managers and comparable market data 
the company periodically experiences events or makes changes to its benefit plans that result in curtailment or special charges 
curtailments are recognized when events occur that significantly reduce the expected years of future service of present employees or eliminates the benefits for a significant number of employees for some or all of their future service 
curtailment losses are recognized when it is probable the curtailment will occur and the effects are reasonably estimable 
curtailment gains are recognized when the related employees are terminated or a plan amendment is adopted  whichever is applicable 
as required under asc  the company remeasures plan assets and obligations during an interim period whenever a significant event occurs that results in a material change in the net periodic pension cost 
the determination of significance is based on judgment and consideration of events and circumstances impacting the pension costs 
the following summarizes the key events whose effects on our net periodic benefit cost and obligations that occurred during the fiscal years ended march  and in april  the company completed an early retirement incentive offer with a portion of its second largest union represented group of production and maintenance employees 
the early retirement incentive offer provided for an increase in the pension benefits payable to covered employees who retire no later than november  this early retirement incentive resulted in a special termination benefit expense of million and is presented on the accompanying consolidated statement of income as curtailments and early retirement incentive expense 
in july  the company completed a similar early retirement incentive offer to its non represented employee participants 
this early retirement incentive provided for an increase in the termination benefits payable through the pension plan to covered employees who retire no later than november  this early retirement incentive resulted in a special termination benefit expense of million and is presented on the accompanying consolidated statement of income as a component of curtailments and early retirement incentive expense  as well as severance charges of million included in acquisition and integration expenses on the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
in october  the company completed an early retirement incentive offer with a portion of its largest union represented group of production and maintenance employees 
the early retirement offer provided for an increase in the pension benefits to covered employees who retire no later than march  this early retirement incentive resulted in a special termination benefit expense of million and is presented on the accompanying consolidated statement of income within curtailments and early retirement incentives 
in february  the company completed a second early retirement incentive offer with an expanded portion of its largest union represented group of production and maintenance employees 
the early retirement offer provided for the same increase  as the october offer  in pension benefits to covered employees who retire no later than september  this early retirement incentive resulted in a special termination benefit expense of million 
in addition  the company concluded that the february offer and the october offer represented such similar actions that they needed to be combined to assess whether the resulting change in the remaining service period indicated that a curtailment had occurred 
the company concluded that a curtailment had occurred and recorded a curtailment loss of million included in curtailments and early retirement incentives on the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended march in february  the company committed to a plan to relocate from its largest operating facility 
in connection with this relocation plan  the company will exit this facility fabrications operations resulting in the termination of a number of defined benefit plan participants 
the company concluded that these terminations will result in a 
table of contents significant reduction in the remaining service period and recorded a curtailment loss of million included in curtailments and early retirement incentives on the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended march  in december  the company negotiated the termination of one its smaller defined benefit plans 
this termination resulted in a million special termination benefit  included in the curtailments and early retirement incentives  on the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended march  in february  the company second largest union represented group of production and maintenance employees ratified a new collective bargaining agreement 
the agreement provides actively employed participants the option to elect a lump sum distribution upon retirement effective april  this change resulted in reduction to the projected benefit obligation of approximately million 
in march  the company announced an amendment to the retirement plans of its non represented employee participants 
effective april   most actively employed participants with years of service and certain highly compensated employees as of april  will no longer continue to accrue a benefit 
those changes resulted in a reduction of the projected pension obligation of approximately million and a related curtailment gain of million included in curtailment and early retirement incentives  on the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended march  pension income  excluding curtailments and special termination benefits early retirement incentives for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared with pension income of million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  for the fiscal year ending march   the company expects to recognize pension income of approximately million 
excluding the effect of the net curtailments in fiscal  the increase in expected pension income in fiscal year results principally from asset performance in fiscal year exceeding the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance included in asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
this guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test described in fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
this guidance allows the company to adopt the topic early to use it in its annual impairment testing for the fiscal year ending march  the company does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on the company consolidated balance sheets  statements of income  or statements of cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
the amendments in this update will require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
the amendments are intended is to enhance required disclosures by improving information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset in accordance with fasb guidance or are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement  irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with fasb guidance 
the provisions of asu are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january  the adoption of the provisions of asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements 
effective march   the company retrospectively adopted asu  presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu was issued to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income oci 
this guidance requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements where the first statement includes the components of net income and the second statement includes the components of oci 
regardless of whether an entity chooses to present comprehensive income in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements  the guidance also would have required an entity to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
however  subsequent to the issuance of asu  this requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of oci in both net income and oci on the face of the financial statements was deferred for further evaluation 
the deferral did not change the requirement to present items of net income  items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements 
the company has elected to present two separate consecutive statements 
the adoption of this 
table of contents standard resulted in a change in presentation and additional footnote disclosure that did not have a significant impact on the company 
forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of relating to our future operations and prospects  including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate  and management beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information 
such statements are based on management beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in this document  words like may  might  will  expect  anticipate  believe  potential  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from management current expectations 
for example  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required or that additional capital  if required  will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us 
in addition to these factors  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  are uncertainties relating to the integration of acquired businesses  general economic conditions affecting our business segments  dependence of certain of our businesses on certain key customers  the risk that we will not realize all of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions as well as competitive factors relating to the aerospace industry 
for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors affecting us  see the risk factors described in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk some contracts with our suppliers for raw materials  component parts and other goods are short term contracts  which are subject to termination on a relatively short term basis 
the prices of our raw materials and component parts fluctuate depending on market conditions  and substantial increases in prices could increase our operating costs  which  as a result of our fixed price contracts  we may not be able to recoup through increases in the prices of our products 
we generally do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk  although we continue to review a full range of business options focused on strategic risk management for all material commodities 
any failure by our suppliers to provide acceptable raw materials  components  kits or subassemblies could adversely affect our production schedules and contract profitability 
we assess qualification of suppliers and continually monitor them to control risk associated with such supply base reliance 
to a lesser extent  we also are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain utilities and services  such as electricity  natural gas  chemicals and freight 
we utilize a range of long term agreements to minimize procurement expense and supply risk in these areas 
foreign exchange risk in addition  even when revenues and expenses are matched  we must translate foreign denominated results of operations  assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar as compared to the respective foreign currencies will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in its original currency 
these transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets  liabilities and stockholders equity 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with forecasted foreign denominated payments related to our ongoing business 
foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at march   a change in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would not have material impact on our unrealized gains 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk 

table of contents interest rate risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our operating results and the cash flow available after debt service to fund operations and expansion 
in addition  an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock  if permitted to do so under certain of our debt arrangements  including the credit facility 
we manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
as of march   approximately of our debt is fixed rate debt 
our financing policy states that we generally maintain between and of our debt as fixed rate debt 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and should be read in conjunction with note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents principal cash flows and the related interest rates 
fixed interest rates disclosed represent the weighted average rate as of march  variable interest rates disclosed fluctuate with the libor  federal funds rates and other weekly rates and represent the weighted average rate at march  expected years of maturity next months months months months months thereafter total fixed rate cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rate variable rate cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rate there are no other significant market risk exposures
