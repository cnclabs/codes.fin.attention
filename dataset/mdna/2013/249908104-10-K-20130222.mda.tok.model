item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview depomed is a specialty pharmaceutical company initially focused on pain and other conditions and diseases of the central nervous system 
the core products of our specialty pharmaceutical business are gralise gabapentin  a once daily product for the management of postherpetic neuralgia that we launched and made commercially available in october  and zipsor diclofenac potassium liquid filled capsules  a product for the treatment of mild to moderate acute pain that we acquired from xanodyne pharmaceuticals  inc xanodyne in june we promote gralise and zipsor with a field force of full time sales representatives who are depomed employees  and part time sales representatives dedicated to the company and employed by a contract sales organization 
we are actively seeking to expand our product portfolio through in licensing  acquiring or obtaining co promotion rights to commercially available products or late stage product candidates that could be marketed and sold effectively with our existing products through our sales and marketing capability 
we also have a portfolio of royalty and milestone producing assets based on our proprietary drug delivery technologies 
the cornerstone of that portion of our business is glumetza  a once daily treatment for adults with type diabetes that we licensed to  and is currently being commercialized by  santarus  inc santarus in the united states 
we have license and development arrangements associated with our acuform gastroretentive drug delivery technology with covidien  ltd 
covidien  boehringer ingelheim international gmbh boehringer ingelheim  ironwood pharmaceuticals  inc ironwood  merck co  inc merck  janssen pharmaceutica nv and janssen pharmaceuticals  inc janssen 
in addition  we have two product candidates in clinical development  serada and dm we submitted a new drug application  or nda  in july for serada for the treatment of menopausal hot flashes 
the nda has been accepted for review by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and we have a prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  goal date of may  the fda has scheduled an advisory committee meeting to discuss the serada nda for march  dm is completed a phase trial for parkinson disease  and we announced a summary of the results of that trial in november critical accounting policies and estimates a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to financial statements  and the impact and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the footnotes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  accrued liabilities  and use of estimates to be critical policies 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  and from license fees  milestones and royalties earned on license agreements and collaborative arrangements 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
product sales gralise 
we sell gralise to wholesalers and retail pharmacies and began shipping to customers in october we accept returns of unsalable product from customers within a return period of six months prior to  and months following product expiration 
gralise tablets currently have a shelf life of months from date of manufacture 
in october  we offered certain launch incentives for customers to stock gralise at pharmacies and wholesalers  which included discounts and extended payment terms 
given the limited history of prescriptions of gralise and launch incentives associated with stocking gralise  we were not able to reliably estimate expected returns of the product at the time of shipment prior to the fourth quarter of accordingly  we initially deferred the recognition of revenue and related product costs of gralise product shipments until the product was dispensed through patient prescriptions 
the quantity of prescription units dispensed was estimated based on an analysis of third party information  including third party market research data and information obtained from wholesalers with respect to inventory levels and inventory movement 
based on the shipment and prescription trends for gralise and based on an analysis of historical return rates of our own experience with products that have a similar customer base and similar return policies  we concluded that we had the information needed to reasonably estimate product returns for gralise during the fourth quarter of beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began recognizing revenue for gralise sales at the time of shipment to our customers 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a one time increase of million in net product sales of gralise  representing product sales previously deferred  net of estimated product returns  managed care and medicaid rebates  wholesaler and retail pharmacy discounts  patient support program discounts  government chargebacks and prompt payment discounts 
including deferred cost of sales  this change resulted in a one time million reduction to net loss and decreased net loss per share by for the twelve months ended december  zipsor 
on june  the acquisition date  we acquired all rights to zipsor diclofenac potassium liquid filled capsules from xanodyne and began distributing zipsor to wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
we accept returns of unsalable product from customers within a return period of six months prior to  and months following product expiration 
we recognize revenue for zipsor sales at the time title transfers to our customers  which occurs at the time product is delivered to our customers 
revenue from sales of zipsor is recorded net of estimated allowances for returns  wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees  prompt pay discounts  patient discount programs  government rebates and chargebacks 
glumetza 
we sold and recorded product sales on shipments of glumetza to wholesalers and retail pharmacies through august the company and santarus entered into a commercialization agreement in august  under which we transferred the rights to manufacture and distribute glumetza in the united states to santarus 
santarus commenced distributing glumetza and began recording product sales in september until august  we recognized revenue for glumetza sales at the time title transferred to our customers  which occurred at the time product was delivered to our customers 
product distributed by us until august is subject to rights of return during the period commencing six months before and 
table of contents ending months after product expiration 
revenue from sales of glumetza were recorded net of estimated allowances for returns  wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees  prompt pay discounts  patient discount programs  government rebates and chargebacks and managed care rebates 
product sales allowances we recognize product sales allowances as a reduction of product sales in the same period the related revenue is recognized 
product sales allowances are based on amounts owed or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration the terms of our agreements with customers  historical product returns  rebates or discounts taken  estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel  the shelf life of the product  and specific known market events  such as competitive pricing and new product introductions 
if actual future results vary from our estimates  we may need to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on product sales and earnings in the period of adjustment 
our product sales allowances include product returns we allow customers to return product for credit on returned product that is within six months before and up to months after its product expiration date 
we estimate product returns on gralise and zipsor 
we also estimate returns on sales of glumetza made by the company through august  as we are financially responsible for return credits on glumetza product we shipped as part of the company commercialization with santarus in august under the terms of the zipsor asset purchase agreement  we also assumed financial responsibility for returns of zipsor product previously sold by xanodyne 
see note of the notes to financial information for further information on the acquisition of zipsor 
the shelf life of gralise is months from the date of tablet manufacture and the shelf life of zipsor is months from the date of tablet manufacture 
the shelf life of the mg glumetza is months from the date of tablet manufacture and the shelf life of the mg glumetza is to months from the date of tablet manufacture 
we monitor actual return history on an individual product lot basis since product launch  which provides us with a basis to reasonably estimate future product returns  taking into consideration the shelf life of product at the time of shipment  shipment and prescription trends  estimated distribution channel inventory levels  and consideration of the introduction of competitive products 
because of the shelf life of our products and our return policy of issuing credits on returned product that is within six months before and up to months after its product expiration date  there may be a significant period of time between when the product is shipped and when we issue credits on returned product 
accordingly  we may have to adjust these estimates  which could have an effect on product sales and earnings in the period of adjustments 
in  based on our review of actual product returns through the end of  we increased our estimate for glumetza product returns 
this resulted in a decrease of product sales of approximately million in related to sales made in prior periods 
as part of our commercialization agreement with santarus  we are responsible for return allowances and credits with respect to glumetza product we shipped through august up to a contractual amount equal to our return reserve estimates at august  if returns allowances and credits on product we shipped come in higher than the contractual amount  santarus will be financially responsible for that difference 
if returns allowances and credits on product we shipped come in lower than the contractual amount  we will pay santarus of that remaining balance 
wholesaler and retail pharmacy discounts we offer contractually determined discounts to certain wholesale distributors and retail pharmacies that purchase directly from us 
these discounts are either taken off invoice at the time of shipment or paid to the customer on a 
table of contents quarterly basis one to two months after the quarter in which product was shipped to the customer 
prompt pay discounts we offer cash discounts to our customers  generally of the sales price  as an incentive for prompt payment 
based on our experience  the company expects its customers to comply with the payment terms to earn the cash discount 
patient discount programs we offer patient discount co pay assistance programs in which patients receive certain discounts off their prescription at participating retail pharmacies 
the discounts are reimbursed by the company approximately one month after the prescriptions subject to the discount are filled 
medicaid rebates we participate in medicaid rebate programs  which provide assistance to certain low income patients based on each individual state guidelines regarding eligibility and services 
under the medicaid rebate programs  we pay a rebate to each participating state  generally two to three months after the quarter in which prescriptions subject to the rebate are filled 
chargebacks we provide discounts to authorized users of the federal supply schedule fss of the general services administration under an fss contract with the department of veterans affairs 
these federal entities purchase products from the wholesale distributors at a discounted price  and the wholesale distributors then charge back to us the difference between the current retail price and the price the federal entity paid for the product 
managed care rebates we offer discounts under contracts with certain managed care providers who do not purchase directly from us 
we generally pay managed care rebates one to two months after the quarter in which prescriptions subject to the rebate are filled 
medicare part d coverage gap rebates we participate in the medicare part d coverage gap discount program under which we provide rebates on prescriptions that fall within the donut hole coverage gap 
we generally pay medicare part d coverage gap rebates two to three months after the quarter in which prescriptions subject to the rebate are filled 
launch discounts we offered certain discounts in connection with the launch and commercial availability of gralise in october we believe our estimates related to gross to net sales adjustments for wholesaler and retail pharmacy fees and discounts  prompt payment discounts  patient discount programs  launch discounts  managed care rebates  and other government chargebacks for gralise  zipsor and glumetza do not have a high degree of estimation complexity or uncertainty as the related amounts are settled within a relatively short period of time 
we believe that our estimated product return allowances require a high degree of judgment and are subject to change based on our experience and certain quantitative and qualitative factors 
our product sales allowances and related accruals are evaluated each reporting period and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
such changes in estimate could affect our results of operations of financial position 

table of contents a rollforward of our product sales allowances for the three years ended december   is as follows in thousands contract sales discounts product returns cash discounts total balance at december  revenue allowances provision related to current period sales provision related to sales made in prior years recorded to balance sheet payments and credits related to sales made in current period payments and credits related to sales made in prior periods balance at december  revenue allowances provision related to current period sales provision related to sales made in prior years recorded to balance sheet payments and credits related to sales made in current period payments and credits related to sales made in prior periods balance at december  revenue allowances acquisition of zipsor provision related to current period sales provision related to sales made in prior years recorded to balance sheet payments and credits related to sales made in current period payments and credits related to sales made in prior periods balance at december  includes wholesaler fees and retail discounts  launch discounts  patient support programs  managed care rebates  and government chargebacks and rebates 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began recognizing gralise product sales at the time title transfers to our customer  and began providing for an estimate of future product returns at that time 
in june  we acquired zipsor and began recognizing zipsor product sales at the time title transfers to our customer  and began providing for an estimate of future product returns at that time 
license and collaborative arrangements revenue from license and collaborative arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations if any  of the licensee  is recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have substantially completed our obligations under the terms of the arrangement and our remaining involvement is inconsequential and perfunctory 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
license fee and collaborative payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
we recognize milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones if the milestone is substantive in nature  and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  the achievement relates to past performance and the fees are nonrefundable 
milestone payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
research and development expense and accruals research and development expenses include related salaries  clinical trial costs  consultant fees  supplies  manufacturing costs for research and development programs and allocations of corporate 
table of contents costs 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
these expenses result from our independent research and development efforts as well as efforts associated with collaborations 
our expense accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received from clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
if possible  we obtain information regarding unbilled services directly from service providers 
however  we may be required to estimate these services based on information available to our product development or administrative staff 
if we underestimate or overestimate the activity associated with a study or service at a given point in time  adjustments to research and development expenses may be necessary in future periods 
historically  our estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred 
stock based compensation the company estimates the fair value of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase plan espp shares using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option 
expected volatility 
the volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the options 
expected life of options 
the company uses historical option exercise data to estimate the expected life of the options 
expected dividend yield 
the company has never paid any dividends and does not intend to in the near future 
as required  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods 
employee and director stock based compensation costs are to be recognized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line attribution method 
forfeitures are to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience 
recognizing and measuring assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at fair value we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
the fair value of the consideration paid  including contingent consideration  is assigned to the underlying net assets of the acquired business based on their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
significant judgments are used in determining the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and in determining estimates of useful lives of long lived assets 
fair value determinations and useful life estimates are based on  among other factors  estimates of expected future net cash flows  estimates of appropriate discount rates used to present value expected future net cash flow streams  the assessment of each asset life cycle  the impact of competitive trends on each asset life cycle and other factors 
these judgments can materially impact the estimates used to allocate acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the resulting timing and amount of amounts charged to  or recognized in current and future operating results 
for these and other reasons  actual results may vary significantly from estimated results 

table of contents we determined the acquisition date fair value of the contingent consideration obligation with respect to the zipsor acquisition based on an income approach derived from zipsor revenue estimates and a probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of achieving the level of net sales that would trigger the contingent payment 
the fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a level measurement as defined in fair value measurement accounting 
the key assumptions in determining the fair value are the discount rate and the probability assigned to the potential milestones being achieved 
at each reporting date  we will re measure the contingent consideration obligation to estimated fair value 
any changes in the fair value of contingent consideration will be recognized in operating expenses until the contingent consideration arrangement is settled 
intangible assets intangible assets consist of purchased developed technology and trademarks 
we evaluate purchased intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
estimating future cash flows related to an intangible asset involves significant estimates and assumptions 
if our assumptions are not correct  there could be an impairment loss or  in the case of a change in the estimated useful life of the asset  a change in amortization expense 
our intangible asset relates to zipsor product rights of million which has been recorded as intangible assets on the accompanying balance sheet and are being amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset on a straight line basis through july as of december  the carrying value was million 
results of operations our results of operations in differ significantly from our reported results for for example  in we recognized million in milestone revenue and a million gain on settlement with regard to termination of our agreement with abbott relating to gralise 
these were one time payments and did not recur in in  we reflect eight months of glumetza product revenue  cost of sales and corresponding promotion expense to santarus and four months of glumetza royalty revenue from santarus 
as a result of the restructuring of our agreement with santarus in august  we recognized royalty revenue from santarus in but no product revenue or promotion expense for glumetza 
in  we recognized million of revenue from sales of gralise and a partial year of corresponding sales and marketing expense 
in  we recognized a full year of gralise sales and incurred a full year of sales and marketing expense 
accordingly  gralise product sales and selling  general and administrative expense are substantially higher in than in in addition  we acquired zipsor in june and zipsor revenue and expense is reflected in our results of operations for the second half of 
table of contents revenues total revenues are summarized in the following table in thousands product sales gralise zipsor glumetza proquin xr total product sales royalties santarus others total royalty revenue license and other revenue gralise glumetza boehringer ingelheim covidien janssen merck other total license and other revenue total revenues product sales gralise 
in october  we announced the commercial availability of gralise and began distributing gralise to wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
the increase in product sales of gralise in is primarily a result of higher prescription demand for gralise and a full year of selling gralise in as compared to three months in until the fourth quarter of  we deferred recognition of revenue on product shipments of gralise until the right of return no longer existed  which occurred at the earlier of a the time gralise units are dispensed through patient prescriptions or b expiration of the right of return 
in the fourth quarter of  we changed our revenue recognition policy for gralise and began recognizing revenue upon shipment to our customers  which resulted in a one time increase of million in product sales during the fourth quarter of we expect gralise product sales and prescriptions to increase in zipsor 
our sales force began promoting zipsor at the end of july product sales for the period between the acquisition date and december  were million 
zipsor product sales in represents a partial year of selling zipsor post acquisition 
accordingly  we expect zipsor revenues to increase in as a result of a full year of selling zipsor 
glumetza 
in august  we restructured our agreement with santarus and entered into a commercialization agreement that superseded the july promotion agreement 
under the commercialization agreement  we granted santarus exclusive rights to manufacture and commercialize glumetza in the united states in return for a royalty on glumetza net sales 
we ceased shipments of 
table of contents glumetza in august  and santarus began selling glumetza in september we will not have any glumetza product sales in future periods 
all of our compensation will be received as royalty income as discussed below 
prior to august  we recognized glumetza product sales and paid santarus a fee for promoting glumetza in the united states 
the decrease in glumetza product sales in compared to was primarily due to depomed distributing and recognizing product sales for glumetza for eight months in as compared to a full year in there were no product sales for glumetza in proquin xr 
we ceased shipments of proquin xr in the fourth quarter of and because of estimated significant levels of inventory at wholesalers and pharmacies in comparison to prescription demand  we deferred revenue recognition on product shipments of proquin xr until the right of return no longer existed  which occurred at the earlier of the time proquin xr units were dispensed through patient prescriptions or expiration of the right of return 
at march   all rights of return expired and the remaining deferred revenue balance for proquin xr was recognized as revenue during the first quarter of we do not expect any future revenues from proquin xr 
royalties santarus 
santarus royalties relate to royalties we received from santarus based on net sales of glumetza in the united states 
royalty revenue from santarus for the year ended december  was million 
this amount increased from  as we received only four month of royalties from santarus in we expect royalty revenue to increase in based on our expectation of increasing net sales of glumetza by santarus and because our royalty rate increased from of net sales for to of net sales for other royalties 
in january  merck received fda approval to market janumet xr in the united states  and merck began selling janumet xr during the first quarter of we currently receive very low single digit royalties on net product sales of janumet xr  and began recognizing royalty revenue in the first quarter of in august  we entered into a license agreement with janssen relating to nucynta er and receive a low single digit royalty on net sales of nucynta er beginning in the third quarter of other royalties also include royalties we received from valeant on net sales of glumetza in canada and from lg life sciences on net sales of lg version of glumetza  novamet gr  in korea 
we expect other royalties to increase in based on our expectation of increasing net sales of janumet xr by merck and a full year of nucynta er royalties from janssen 
license and other revenue gralise 
in january  abbott products received fda approval of gralise for the management of postherpetic neuralgia  which triggered a million development milestone from abbott products to us  which we received in february because the milestone was substantive in nature  achieved and based on past performance  the entire million was recognized as license revenue in the first quarter of pursuant to the exclusive license agreement originally entered into in november  solvay pharmaceuticals  inc solvay paid us a million upfront fee in february the upfront payment received was originally scheduled to be recognized as revenue ratably until january  which represented the estimated length of time our development and supply obligations existed under the agreement 
in connection with the termination of the license agreement with abbott products  we no longer have continuing obligations to abbott products 
accordingly  all remaining deferred revenue related to the million upfront license fee previously received from abbott products was fully 
table of contents recognized as revenue in march  resulting in immediate recognition of approximately million of license revenue 
glumetza 
glumetza license revenue for  and consisted of license revenue recognized from the million upfront license fee received from valeant in july and the million upfront fee received from santarus in july we are recognizing the million upfront license fee payment from valeant as revenue ratably until october  which represents the estimated length of time our obligations exist under the arrangement related to royalties we are obligated to pay valeant on net sales of glumetza in the united states and for our obligation to use as our sole supplier of the mg glumetza 
pursuant to the promotion agreement originally entered into in july  santarus paid us a million upfront fee 
the upfront payment received was originally being amortized as revenue ratably until october  which represented the estimated length of time our obligations existed under the promotion agreement related to manufacturing glumetza and paying santarus promotion fees on gross margin of glumetza 
the commercialization agreement in august superseded the promotion agreement and removed our promotion fee obligations and contemplated removal of our manufacturing obligations 
the commercialization agreement included obligations with respect to manufacturing and regulatory transition to santarus and managing the patent infringement lawsuits against sun and lupin 
at the time of the commercialization agreement  all of these obligations were estimated to be completed in december during the fourth quarter of  events occurred related to the transfer of manufacturing with one of the contract manufacturers of glumetza that pushed the estimated completion date of depomed manufacturing obligations to february  which is now the estimated length of time we expect our obligations will completed under the commercialization agreement 
on the effective date of the commercialization agreement  the amortization period related to remaining deferred revenue on the million upfront fee was adjusted  and the remaining deferred revenue of million was changed to be recognized ratably until december during the fourth quarter of  the amortization period related to remaining deferred revenue on the million upfront fee was adjusted again  and the remaining deferred revenue of million was changed to be recognized ratably until february we recognized approximately million  million and million of revenue associated with this upfront license fee during  and  respectively 
the remaining deferred revenue balance is million at december   and we anticipate that we will recognize this entire amount as revenue ratably until february in january  we achieved the first sales milestone under the promotion agreement with santarus related to net sales of glumetza reaching million for the month period ending january   which triggered a milestone payment of million  which we received in march as the milestone was achieved and related to past performance the entire million was recognized as milestone revenue in the first quarter of covidien 
in november  we entered into a license agreement with covidien granting covidien worldwide rights to utilize our acuform technology for the exclusive development of four products containing acetaminophen in combination with opiates 
in  covidien paid us a total of million in upfront fees  representing a million upfront license fee and a million upfront payment for formulation work to be performed by depomed under the agreement 
the entire million was initially accounted for as a single unit of accounting and being amortized ratably through november  which was initially the estimated length of time depomed was obligated to perform formulation work under the agreement 

table of contents the development of each of the four products was to begin by november depomed formulation obligations related to the first and second products were completed in october and september  respectively 
covidien did not elect to initiate development of the remaining two products under the agreement by november  and under the agreement  depomed was no longer required to perform formulation work on those two products 
accordingly  depomed formulation obligations were completed during the fourth quarter of as depomed no longer had any substantive continuing performance obligations  all remaining deferred revenue related to the million in upfront license fees previously received from covidien was fully recognized as revenue in the fourth quarter of this resulted in a one time increase in license revenue of million during the fourth quarter of through december   we have also recognized a total of million in milestone revenue under the agreement 
in october  the first formulation was completed by us and delivered to covidien  which triggered a million milestone payment from covidien to us in october in september  we recognized million on completion and delivery of the second formulation under the agreement to covidien  and an additional million on the first formulation under the agreement entering clinical development 
in november  we recognized million on the second formulation under the agreement entering clinical development

the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses cannot be predicted at this time for our product candidates in research and development  as it is not possible to determine the nature  timing and extent of clinical trials and studies  the fda requirements for a particular drug and the requirements and level of participation  if any  by potential partners 
as potential products proceed through the development process  each step is typically more extensive  and therefore more expensive  than the previous step 
success in development therefore  generally results in increasing expenditures until actual product approval

as of december   we have accumulated net losses of million 
we may incur operating losses in future years 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will permit us to meet our capital and operational requirements for at least the next two years 
we base this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
our cash needs may also vary materially from our current expectations because of numerous factors  including sales of our marketed products  expenditures related to our commercialization of gralise and zipsor  including our contractual obligations to ventiv and other arrangements we make for the commercialization of gralise and zipsor  milestone and royalty revenue we receive under our collaborative development and commercialization arrangements  acquisitions or licenses of complementary businesses  products or technologies  expenditures related to our commercialization and development efforts  including arrangements we might make for the commercialization of serada  if the product is approved for marketing  financial terms of definitive license agreements or other commercial agreements we may enter into  results of research and development efforts  changes in the focus and direction of our business strategy and or research and development programs  and results of clinical testing requirements of the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies

to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities or from development and licensing arrangements to continue our development programs 
we may be unable to raise such additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders equity positions 
if adequate funds are not available we may have to significantly curtail commercialization of our marketed products or other operations  obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms  and or delay  postpone or terminate clinical trials
