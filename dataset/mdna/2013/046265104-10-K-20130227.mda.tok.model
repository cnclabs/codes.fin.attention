item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
executive summary the following overview should be read in conjunction with our md a in its entirety 
as the premier long island community bank  our goals are to enhance shareholder value while continuing to build a solid banking franchise 
we focus on growing our core businesses of mortgage portfolio lending and retail banking while maintaining strong asset quality and controlling operating expenses 
we also provide returns to shareholders through dividends 
although we remain committed to offering traditional retail deposit products and residential mortgage loans  we have been developing strategies to grow other loan categories to diversify earning assets and to increase low cost core deposits 
these strategies include continued reliance on our multi family and commercial real estate mortgage lending operations and  over time  significantly expanding our business banking operations 
our business banking initiative includes focusing on small and mid sized businesses  with an emphasis on attracting clients from larger competitors 
we are also considering expanding our branch network into other locations on long island and opening branches in manhattan 
we are impacted by both national and regional economic factors 
with residential mortgage loans from various regions of the country held in our portfolio  the condition of the national economy impacts our earnings 
during and continuing through  the us economy has shown signs of a very slow and tenuous recovery from the recession which began in the national unemployment rate  while still at a high level  declined to for december  compared to a peak of for october  although new job growth remains slow 
softness persists in the housing and real estate markets  although the extent of such softness varies from region to region 
with respect to our multi family mortgage loan origination activities  primarily focused in new york  we have observed favorable market conditions during in addition to the challenging economic environment in which we compete  the regulation and oversight of our business changed significantly in as described in more detail in part i  item a  risk factors  certain aspects of the reform act continue to have a significant impact on us  including the expanded regulatory burden resulting from oversight of astoria federal by the occ and the cfpb and oversight of astoria financial corporation by the frb  as well as changes to  and significant increases in  deposit insurance assessments  the imposition of consolidated holding company capital requirements and the roll back of federal preemption applicable to certain of our operations 
the frb has issued notices of proposed rulemaking during that would subject all savings and loan holding companies  including astoria financial corporation  to consolidated capital requirements 
these proposed rules also would revise the quantity and quality of required minimum risk based and leverage capital requirements  consistent with the reform act and the basel iii capital standards  and would revise the rules for calculating risk weighted assets to enhance their risk sensitivity  which  among other things  would generally phase out trust preferred securities as a component of tier capital 
although implementation of the rules has been delayed  we are continuing to review the impact that the reform act  basel iii and related proposed rulemaking will have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
net income for the year ended december  decreased compared to the year ended december  this decline was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income and an increase in provision for loan losses  partially offset by an increase in non interest income 
net interest income  the net interest rate spread and the net interest margin for the year ended december  were lower compared to the 
table of contents year ended december   primarily due to a more rapid decline in the yields on interest earning assets than the decline in the costs of interest bearing liabilities 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased compared to the year ended december   primarily due to lower average yields on mortgage loans and mortgage backed and other securities and a decline in the average balances of residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed and other securities  partially offset by an increase in the average balance of multi family and commercial real estate mortgage loans 
interest expense for the year ended december  also decreased in relation to the year ended december   primarily due to decreases in interest expense on certificates of deposit and borrowings 
the decrease in interest expense on certificates of deposit primarily reflects a decline in the average balance of such accounts  although the average cost also declined 
the decline in interest expense on borrowings was attributable to a decline in the average cost of borrowings  offset by an increase in the average balance 
on june   we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due  or senior notes 
the proceeds from the sale of the senior notes were used to redeem our million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due october  or senior notes  on september  the repayment of the senior notes and issuance of the senior notes will result in a reduction of future annual interest expense with respect to our other borrowings 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the year ended december  the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan losses reflects the general stabilizing trend in overall asset quality we have experienced since as total delinquencies have continued a downward trend 
while the level of our non performing loans has continued its downward trend throughout  we expect the levels will remain somewhat elevated for some time  especially in certain states where judicial foreclosure proceedings are required 
the allowance for loan losses at december  reflects the composition and size of our loan portfolio  the levels and composition of our loan delinquencies and non performing loans  our loss history and our evaluation of the housing and real estate markets and overall economy  including the unemployment rate and other factors 
non interest income increased for  compared to  as lower customer service fees were more than offset by gain on sales of securities in and increases in mortgage banking income  net  and other non interest income 
gain on sale of securities includes a million gain realized in the fourth quarter resulting from the sale of our investment in two issues of freddie mac perpetual preferred securities 
the sale of these securities  which had been written off in prior years as an impaired asset for book purposes  had the effect of reducing our net deferred tax asset and eliminated the potential risk for the exclusion of the deferred tax asset related to these securities from regulatory capital in future periods 
non interest expense decreased slightly for compared to primarily due to decreases in compensation and benefits expense and advertising expense  substantially offset by increases in fdic insurance premium expense and occupancy  equipment and systems expense 
the reduction in compensation and benefits expense reflects lower esop related expense as well as the benefits resulting from our cost control initiatives implemented in the first quarter 
on october   the new york metropolitan area was hit by hurricane sandy  one of the most significant storm systems experienced in this area 
as a result  we temporarily ceased all operations 
we resumed operations on october   although certain of our branch locations were unable to immediately re open due to loss of power and other damage sustained 
repair and recovery costs reflected in non interest expense totaled  in addition  in support of the communities we serve  we contributed relief donations of  and waived banking fees of approximately  for customers impacted by the storm 
from a credit standpoint  we have not yet experienced any notable increase in missed loan payments from our borrowers  nor are we presently aware of significant declines in the value of the collateral for our loans  as a direct result of the storm 

table of contents total assets declined during the year ended december  primarily due to decreases in our securities portfolio and other assets 
the decline in the securities portfolio resulted from principal payments received in excess of purchases during our mortgage loan portfolio declined slightly at december  compared to december   reflecting a decrease in our residential mortgage loan portfolio which was substantially offset by the growth in our multi family and commercial real estate loan portfolio 
the decline in our residential mortgage loan portfolio reflects the continued elevated levels of loan repayments which more than offset our origination and purchase volume due to historic low interest rates for thirty year fixed rate conforming loans  thereby making the hybrid arm product less attractive to borrowers 
the growth in our multi family and commercial real estate loan portfolio reflects the resumption of such lending in the latter half of and strong loan production during at december   our multi family and commercial real estate portfolio represented of our total loan portfolio  up from at december  this reflects our focus on repositioning the asset mix of our balance sheet  concentrating more on higher yielding multi family loans than on lower yielding residential loans 
total deposits declined during the year ended december  reflecting a reduction in certificates of deposit  while low cost core deposits increased 
at december   our low cost core deposits represented of total deposits  up from at december  this reflects our efforts to reposition the liability mix of our balance sheet  reducing high cost certificates of deposit and increasing low cost core deposits 
included in the increase in core deposits is a increase in our business core deposits reflecting the initial benefits realized from our business banking expansion initiatives 
notwithstanding the decline in certificates of deposit  during the year ended december  we extended million of certificates of deposit for terms of two years or more in an effort to help limit our exposure to future increases in interest rates 
our borrowings portfolio increased during the year ended december  due to an increase in fhlb ny advances  partially offset by a decline in reverse repurchase agreements 
excluding the newly issued senior notes  during the year ended december  we extended million of fixed rate  non callable borrowings with a weighted average rate of and a weighted average term of years 
during this period of historic low interest rates  we have utilized low cost borrowings to offset the decline in high cost certificates of deposit to help manage interest rate risk 
with the yield curve remaining flattened and interest rates expected to remain at historic lows for the next several years  the operating environment for financial institutions remains challenging 
we will  therefore  continue during to concentrate on growing our multi family and commercial real estate loan portfolio and increasing low cost core deposits  including the expansion of our business banking platform 
this will include the addition of seasoned business relationship managers to accelerate business deposit growth  coupled with the opening of branches in select communities that offer increased opportunities to extend our business banking footprint 
while these initiatives are expected to result in higher general and administrative expense in  we expect that they will further enhance the value of our franchise and improve future profitability 
in addition  the positive effect of the balance sheet repositioning should help mitigate the negative impact of the low interest rate environment
