critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on conditions existing at and trends leading up to the time the estimates and assumptions are made  actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions 
we continually review our accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates and how they are applied in the preparation of the financial statements 
basis of presentation and consolidation 
we consolidate all entities we control by ownership of a majority voting interest and variable interest entities for which we have the power to direct activities and the obligation to absorb losses 
our judgment in determining if we consolidate a variable interest entity includes assessing which party  if any  has the power and benefits 
therefore  we evaluate which activities most significantly affect the variable interest entities economic performance and determine whether we  or another party  have the power to direct these activities 
we apply the equity method of accounting for our investments in joint ventures and other investees whenever we can exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee 
our consolidated net income includes our share of the net earnings or losses from these investees 
our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering factors such as our ownership interest  board representation and policy making decisions 
we periodically evaluate these equity investments for potential impairment where a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary 
we eliminate all significant intercompany transactions from financial results 
revenue recognition 
advance ticket sales and event related revenues for future events are deferred until earned  which is generally once the events are conducted 
the recognition of event related expenses is matched with the recognition of event related revenues 
nascar contracts directly with certain network providers for television rights to the entire nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series schedules 
event promoters share in the television rights fees in accordance with the provision of the sanction agreement for each nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series event 
under the terms 
table of contents of this arrangement  nascar retains percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series event as a component of its sanction fees 
the promoter records percent of the gross broadcast rights fees as revenue and then records percent of the gross broadcast rights fees as part of its awards to the competitors 
ultimately  the promoter retains percent of the net cash proceeds from the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to the event 
our revenues from marketing partnerships are paid in accordance with negotiated contracts  with the identities of partners and the terms of sponsorship changing from time to time 
some of our marketing partnership agreements are for multiple facilities and or events and include multiple specified elements  such as tickets  hospitality chalets  suites  display space and signage for each included event 
the allocation of such marketing partnership revenues between the multiple elements  events and facilities is based on relative selling price 
the sponsorship revenue allocated to an event is recognized when the event is conducted 
revenues and related costs from the sale of merchandise to retail customers  internet sales and direct sales to dealers are recognized at the time of sale 
business combinations 
all business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method 
whether net assets or common stock is acquired  fair values are determined and assigned to the purchased assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired entity 
the excess of the cost of the acquisition over fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
business combinations involving existing motorsports entertainment facilities commonly result in a significant portion of the purchase price being allocated to the fair value of the contract based intangible asset associated with long term relationships manifest in the sanction agreements with sanctioning bodies  such as nascar and grand american series 
the continuity of sanction agreements with these bodies has historically enabled the facility operator to host motorsports events year after year 
while individual sanction agreements may be of terms as short as one year  a significant portion of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of acquired tangible assets is commonly paid to acquire anticipated future cash flows from events promoted pursuant to these agreements which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and therefore  in accordance with asc  business combinations  are recorded as indefinite lived intangible assets recognized apart from goodwill 
capitalization and depreciation policies 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
when we construct assets  we capitalize costs of the project  including  but not limited to  certain pre acquisition costs  permitting costs  fees paid to architects and contractors  certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary  property taxes and interest 
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered an operating expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
when constructing or purchasing assets  we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired  which also is a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense for financial statement purposes is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets  industry  legal and regulatory factors  and our expectations of the usage of the asset 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
interest costs associated with major development and construction projects are capitalized as part of the cost of the project 
interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings  since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development or construction project 
we capitalize interest on a project when development or construction activities begin  and cease when such activities are substantially complete or are suspended for more than a brief period 
impairment loss on disposal of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our consolidated balance sheets include significant amounts of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets which could be subject to impairment loss on disposal 
in fiscal  we recorded a before tax charge of approximately million as an impairment loss on disposal of long lived assets primarily attributable to the non cash impairment of certain costs related to the daytona development project and removal of certain other long lived assets located at our motorsports facilities 
in fiscal  we recorded a before tax charge totaling approximately million  as an impairment loss on disposal of long lived assets  primarily attributable to the removal of certain other long lived assets located at our motorsports facilities 
in fiscal  we recorded a before tax charge totaling approximately million  as an impairment loss on disposal of long lived assets  primarily attributable to the removal of certain other long lived assets located at our motorsports facilities 

table of contents as of november   goodwill and other intangible assets and property and equipment accounts for approximately billion  or percent of our total assets 
we account for our goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc and for our long lived assets in accordance with asc we follow applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets which specifies  among other things  non amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires testing for possible impairment  either upon the occurrence of an impairment indicator or at least annually 
we complete our annual testing in our fiscal fourth quarter  based on assumptions regarding our future business outlook and expected future discounted cash flows attributable to such assets using the fair value assessment provision of applicable authoritative guidance  supported by quoted market prices or comparable transactions where available or applicable 
while we continue to review and analyze many factors that can impact our business prospects in the future as further described in risk factors  our analysis is subjective and is based on conditions existing at  and trends leading up to  the time the estimates and assumptions are made 
different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significant  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the impairment evaluation and our future condition or results of operations 
despite the current adverse economic trends  the decline in consumer confidence and the rise in unemployment  which have contributed to the decrease in attendance related as well as corporate partner revenues for certain of our motorsports entertainment events since fiscal  we believe there has been no significant change in the long term fundamentals of our ongoing motorsports event business 
we believe our present operational and cash flow outlook further support our conclusion 
in connection with our fiscal assessment of goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment we used the methodology described above 
we believe our methods used to determine fair value and evaluate possible impairment were appropriate  relevant  and represent methods customarily available and used for such purposes 
our latest annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal indicated there had been no impairment and the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for the respective reporting units  except for one reporting unit 
the estimated fair value for this one reporting unit  which has goodwill of less than million  exceeded the carrying value by less than percent as determined using our internal discounted cash flow methodology 
we believe the most recent comparable market transactions would support a substantially higher valuation 
in addition  our growth strategy includes investing in certain joint venture opportunities 
in these equity investments we exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee  which adds an additional element of risk that can adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
the carrying value of our equity investments was million at november  income taxes 
the tax law requires that certain items be included in our tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses not deductible on our tax return 
however  some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense  and these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
actual income taxes could vary significantly from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or changes or adjustments resulting from final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities  which could also adversely impact our cash flow 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc  income taxes 
under this guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
contingent liabilities 
our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on our view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency 
in the ordinary course of business  we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and other experts both within and outside our company 
we accrue a liability if the likelihood of 
table of contents an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose the matter but do not accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible and an estimate of loss is not determinable 
legal and other costs incurred in conjunction with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
equity and other investments hollywood casino at kansas speedway in february  kansas entertainment joint venture of penn  a subsidiary of penn national gaming  inc and kansas speedway development corporation ksdc  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of isc  opened the hollywood themed and branded destination entertainment facility  overlooking turn two of kansas speedway

staten island property our wholly owned indirect subsidiary  development  owns a total of acres located in the new york city borough of staten island 
we are currently in exclusive negotiations with an interested buyer for development 
the timing of any closing is uncertain and we cannot assure that one will occur as a result of these exclusive negotiations 
motorsports authentics we are a partner with speedway motorsports  inc in a joint venture  smisc  llc  which  through its wholly owned subsidiary ma 
ma designs  promotes  markets and distributes motorsports licensed merchandise 
our investment in ma was previously reduced to zero and we did not recognize any net income or loss from operations of ma during fiscal years   and  respectively 
as of november   we had a guaranty exposure to one nascar team licensor of approximately million 
the guaranty exposure was satisfied upon ma making its final payment to the nascar team licensor on december  senior notes at november  we had registered senior notes the percent senior notes totaling approximately million  net of unamortized discounts  which bore interest at percent and were due april in march  we utilized additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility to redeem and retire all outstanding million principal amount of the percent senior notes  including the payment of a tender premium of approximately million and accrued interest 
the net tender premium  associated unamortized net deferred financing costs and unamortized original issuance discount were recorded as loss on early redemption of debt totaling approximately million 
in september  we completed an offering of approximately million principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a private placement percent senior notes 
the percent senior notes bear interest at percent and are due january the percent senior notes require semi annual interest payments on september and february through their maturity 
the percent senior notes may be redeemed in whole or in part  at our option  at any time or from time to time at redemption prices as defined in the indenture 
certain of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are guarantors of the percent senior notes 
the percent senior notes also contain various restrictive covenants 
the deferred financing fees associated with the percent senior notes are treated as additional interest expense and are being amortized over the life of the percent senior notes on a straight line method  which approximates the effective yield method 
the funds 
table of contents received were used to pay down million of the outstanding balance on our then existing million revolving credit facility 
stock purchase plan an important component of our capital allocation strategy is returning capital to shareholders 
we have solid operating margins that generate substantial operating cash flow 
using these internally generated proceeds  we have returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders primarily through our share repurchase program 
we have a share repurchase program stock purchase plan under which we are authorized to purchase up to million of our outstanding class a common shares 
the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the stock purchase plan will depend on a variety of factors  including price  corporate and regulatory requirements  capital availability and other market conditions 
the stock purchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
no shares have been or will be knowingly purchased from company insiders or their affiliates 
since inception of the plan through november   we have purchased  shares of our class a common shares  for a total of approximately million 
included in these totals are the purchases of   and  shares of the company s class a common shares at an average cost of approximately  and per share including commissions  for a total of approximately million  million and million  during the fiscal years ended november    and  respectively 
transactions occur in open market purchases and pursuant to a trading plan under rule b at november   we had approximately million remaining repurchase authority under the current stock purchase plan 
income taxes the de recognition of potential interest and penalties associated with certain state settlements as well as certain state credits accrued are the principal causes of the decreased effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended november  the effective income tax rate for fiscal year ended november  approximated the statutory income tax rate 
the reduction in the valuation allowance associated with the wind up of certain canadian business operations is the principal cause of the decreased effective income tax rate for the year ended november as a result of the above items  our effective income tax rate decreased from the statutory income rate to approximately percent and percent for the fiscal year ended november  and  respectively 
current litigation from time to time  we are a party to routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not believe that the resolution of any or all of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
future trends in operating results our results of operations are sensitive to changes in economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment levels  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates  impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure corporate marketing partnerships 
the unprecedented adverse economic trends  which significantly impacted consumer confidence  have affected the frequency with which our guests attended our major motorsports entertainment events 
we mitigated the decline in certain revenue categories with cost containment initiatives 
the majority of the cost containment initiatives undertaken are sustainable 
beginning in  we re instituted merit pay increases to more normalized levels 
we do not have further significant incremental costs that can be eliminated without materially altering how we operate our business 
the economy  while showing signs of improvement  remains fragile 
consumer confidence has rebounded but remains tenuous given current market conditions such as job and income growth  and recent political events 
absent sustained improvement in consumer confidence that includes an increase in discretionary spending  we expect certain adverse trends to persist in  which will impact our business  especially attendance related and corporate partner revenues 
admissions achieving event sellouts and creating excess demand are crucial to the optimal performance of our major motorsports facilities that host nascar sprint cup series events 
an important component of our operating strategy has been our long standing practice of focusing on supply and demand when evaluating ticket pricing and adjusting capacity at our facilities 
by effectively managing ticket prices and seating capacity  we have historically shown the ability to stimulate ticket renewals and advance ticket sales 

table of contents advance ticket sales result in earlier cash flow and reduce the potential negative impact of actual  as well as forecasted  inclement weather 
with any ticketing initiative  we first examine our ticket pricing structure at each of our major motorsports entertainment facilities to ensure prices are on target with market demand 
when deemed necessary  we will adjust ticket pricing 
we believe our ticket pricing is consistent with current demand  providing attractive price points for all income levels 
it is important that we maintain the integrity of our ticket pricing model by rewarding our customers who purchase tickets during the renewal period 
we do not adjust pricing downward inside of the sales cycle to avoid rewarding last minute ticket buyers by discounting tickets 
further  we closely monitor and manage the availability of promotional tickets 
all of these factors have a detrimental effect on our ticket pricing model and long term value of our business 
we believe it is more important to encourage advance ticket sales and maintain price integrity to achieve long term growth than to capture short term incremental revenue 
we continue to implement innovative accelerated ticket pricing strategies whereby prices increase over time as well as price increases week of day of races to capture incremental revenues 
adjusting seating capacity is another strategy to promote sellouts and create excess demand 
since  we have have reduced capacity at our major motorsports facilities by approximately percent 
a portion of the capacity reduction was a result of providing improved fan amenities such as wider seating and creating social zones 
based on experience and the evolution of modern sports facilities  demand depends in part on the fans experience 
enhancing the live event experience for our fans is a critical strategy for our future growth 
we will continue to monitor market demand and sports entertainment best in class amenities  which could impact capacity at certain of our major motorsports facilities 
the industry and its stakeholders are committed to growing the sport and have aligned with nascar as it initiates its five year industry action plan iap to connect with existing fans  as well as engage gen y  youth and multicultural consumers in motorsports 
additional areas of focus within the iap  supported by all stakeholders to enhance the appeal of nascar racing  include building product relevance  cultivating driver star power  growing social media activities and enhancing the event experience 
a major product relevance is the introduction of the next generation sprint cup car for gen 
the gen program is the most comprehensive overhaul in the sport since the debut of the car of tomorrow  and its goal is to re establish brand identity among the automotive manufacturers and provide competitive upgrades in an effort to improve competition in nascar s sprint cup series 
additional initiatives within the iap include nascar and fox deportes  the no 
us latino sports network  teaming up to provide the sport most expansive spanish language broadcast offering with coverage of sprint cup series races  including for the first time  a spanish language broadcast of the daytona and several other events  as well as original programming  daily news segments and weekly updates 
to support the iap  we are committed to meeting and exceeding our fans expectations through on going capital improvements at our facilities 
we are providing our fans enhanced audio and visual experiences  more comfortable and wider seating  more concession and merchandise points of sale  and greater social connectivity 
corporate partnerships we believe that our presence in key metropolitan statistical areas  year round event schedule  impressive portfolio of major motorsports events and attractive fan demographics are beneficial as we continue to pursue renewal and expansion of existing corporate marketing partnerships and establish new corporate relationships 
our corporate sales team continues to generate strong levels of interest from corporate prospects 
economic trends influence corporate budgets  sales and contract duration 
due to these trends we had more available inventory going into the season than in previous years 
and  during the year  we experienced a mix of both increasing and decreasing pricing as we sold available inventory 
in spite of the these trends and mixed pricing  we have been able to accurately target our gross corporate marketing partnership revenues over past the few years 
of benefit as we enter into the motorsports season is that we have less open entitlement inventory compared to this time last year entering the season 
we have sold all of our available nascar sprint cup series entitlements for the year 
the remaining open nascar entitlements include two nationwide series and two camping world truck series entitlements 
last year at this time  we had five nascar sprint cup series  three nascar nationwide series and two camping world truck series entitlements open 
new entitlement partners include kellogg  sprint and toyota 
corporate sponsors continue to generate a solid return on their investment by using entitlements to grow their respective businesses 
entitlements provide our corporate partners an opportunity to essentially own an entire week of the nascar season while receiving valuable exposure for months prior to 
table of contents the event 
with less open entitlements  our sales force is focusing on our official sponsor categories and concept based partnerships  which will benefit this year and television broadcast and ancillary media rights domestic broadcast and ancillary media rights fees revenues are an important component of our revenue and earnings stream 
starting in  nascar entered into combined eight year agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed for the domestic broadcast and related rights for its three national touring series sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck 
the agreements total approximately billion over the eight year period from through this results in an approximate million gross average annual rights fee for the industry  a more than percent increase over the previous contract average of million annually 
the industry rights fees were approximately million  million  million  million  and million for fiscal     and respectively  and will be approximately million for  and million for fox and tnt have been strong supporters of nascar racing since  and both have played a major role in the sport s climb in popularity 
we have  and expect to continue to see  ongoing broadcast innovation in their coverage of nascar racing events 
also notable was the return of espn to the sport in  which it helped build throughout the s and s 
espn s coverage and weekly ancillary nascar related programming continues to promote the sport across its various channels 
further  espn broadcasts substantially the entire abc espn inventory of nascar sprint cup and nationwide series events  providing these series with the continuity and promotional support that we believe allow them to flourish 
espn  with a subscriber base at approximately million homes  has the ability to attract younger viewers as well as create more exposure for the sport 
cable broadcasters can typically support a higher investment due to subscriber fees that are not available to traditional networks  which is a potential benefit as nascar negotiates the next consolidated domestic broadcast media rights contract 
while the media landscape continues to evolve  we believe nascar s position in the sports and entertainment industry remains strong 
in fiscal  the th running of the daytona was rescheduled due to inclement weather and for the first time in its storied history the event was hosted during fox s primetime 
the event was the most watched nascar broadcast ever for fox with a domestic viewing audience of million seeing a portion of the race 
the nascar sprint cup series remains the second highest rated regular season sport on television 
for the season  nascar sprint cup series events ranked among the top sports of the weekend on television out of points event weekends in an average of million households and million viewers tuned into each nascar sprint cup series event 
also  over million unique viewers tuned into a nascar sprint cup series event  and on average per event  nascar has the second largest number of individual and multiple viewers as well as the largest percentage of female viewers 
the nascar sprint cup series is the number two sport among all key demographic groups  trailing only the nfl 
in addition  the nascar nationwide series is the second highest rated motorsports series on television and the nascar camping world truck series is the third highest rated motorsports series on cable television 
benefiting nascar as well as other sports  is that advertising on sports spending has increased approximately percent over the past three years to billion annually  according to neilson 
a factor that has contributed to this substantial increase in advertising spending is the proliferation of digital video recorders dvr 
in  according to neilson  only percent of households in the us had a dvr  today over percent of households have a dvr 
nascar s solid ratings as well as other factors such as the strong demand for live broadcasting and the proliferation of dvrs  were contributing factors to fox signing an eight year extension of its broadcast rights 
industry sources value the extension at more than billion over eight years  an approximate percent increase over the current agreement that expires after the season 
the agreement with fox also includes tv everywhere rights  which will allow fox to stream the races it broadcasts to fox sports affiliated websites 
as a result of the fox agreement  we believe nascar has a strong negotiating position for the remaining media rights inventory 
domestic broadcast media rights fees provide significant cash flow visibility to us  race teams and nascar over the contract term 
television broadcast and ancillary rights fees from continuing operations received from nascar for the nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events conducted at our facilities under these agreements  and recorded as part of motorsports related revenue  were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
operating income generated by these media rights were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
we also benefit from nascar s ancillary rights agreements for which we receive a share of contracted revenues from various partners 
through ancillary rights sharing we receive  at times  revenues for international broadcasting  nascar images  specialty pay per view telecasts and other media content distribution 
the various contracted agreements are negotiated separately by nascar  and vary in terms and duration 

table of contents siriusxm radio had been the most significant contributor to the industry s ancillary rights revenue 
in  sirius satellite radio  the predecessor to siriusxm radio  entered into a five year agreement to be nascar s exclusive satellite radio partner 
since entering into the contract  sirius satellite radio and xm satellite radio merged to form sirius xm radio 
prior to this merger  both were actively competing against each other for the distribution rights for original programming thereby increasing the pricing of these rights 
with the merger completed in and only one satellite provider bidding  distribution rights agreements entered into currently have generally been lower 
this is the case with the agreement nascar entered into for siriusxm radio to continue as the exclusive satellite rights provider for nascar 
for  the industry received an immaterial amount of ancillary revenue  due primarily to the following factors the aforementioned lower future rights fees received from sirius xm radio  and in order to achieve optimal exploitation of online content  nascar and turner sports restructured and extended their long standing digital partnership 
the new agreement takes the relationship through under the new partnership  nascar assumed operational control in of all of its interactive  digital and social media rights including technical operations and infrastructure of all nascar digital platforms 
turner will continue to represent sponsorships and advertising for all nascar digital platforms 
as media rights revenues fluctuate so do the variable costs tied to the percentage of broadcast rights fees required to be paid to competitors as part of nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series sanction agreements 
nascar prize and point fund monies  as well as sanction fees nascar direct expenses  are outlined in the sanction agreement for each event and are negotiated in advance of an event 
as previously discussed  included in these nascar direct expenses are amounts equal to percent of the gross domestic television broadcast rights fees allocated to our nascar sprint cup  nationwide and camping world truck series events  as part of prize and point fund money see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
these annually negotiated contractual amounts paid to nascar contribute to the support and growth of the sport of nascar stock car racing through payments to the teams and sanction fees paid to nascar 
as such  we do not expect these costs to materially decrease in the future as a percentage of admissions and motorsports related income 
sanctioning bodies our success has been  and is expected to remain  dependent on maintaining good working relationships with the organizations that sanction events at our facilities  particularly with nascar  whose sanctioned events at our wholly owned facilities accounted for approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal nascar continues to entertain and discuss proposals from track operators regarding potential realignment of their portfolio of nascar sprint cup series dates to more geographically diverse and potentially more desirable markets where there may be greater demand  resulting in an opportunity for increased revenues to the track operators 
we believe that realignments have provided  and will continue to provide  incremental net positive revenue and earnings as well as further enhance the sport s exposure in highly desirable markets  which we believe benefits the sport s fans  teams  sponsors and television broadcast partners as well as promoters 
capital improvements enhancing the live event experience for our guest is a critical strategy for our future growth 
we compete for the consumers discretionary dollar with other entertainment options such as concerts and other major sporting events not just motorsports events 
we remain convinced that our focus on driving incremental earnings by improving the fan experience will in time lead to increased ticket sales with better pricing power  growth in sponsorship and hospitality sales  continued growth in broadcast media rights fees agreements  and greater potential to capture market share 
today s consumer wants easy access into and out of a venue  comfortable and wider seating  clean and available facilities  more points of sales  enhanced audio and visual engagement  and social connectivity 
we also anticipate modest capital spending on other projects for maintenance  safety and regulatory requirements 
we are confident that by delivering memorable guest experiences  along with attractive pricing and fantastic racing  we will generate increased revenues as well as bottom line results 
while we focus on allocating our capital to generate returns in excess of our cost of capital  certain of these capital improvement investments may not provide immediate  directly traceable near term positive returns on invested capital but over the longer term will better enable us to effectively compete with other entertainment venues for consumer and corporate spending 
we are currently in the process of reviewing potentially highly impactful projects that would necessitate an increase in our capital spending at existing facilities above recent levels 
the evolution of sports facilities is ongoing and is relevant for all sports not just motorsports 
as consumer and corporate behaviors and demands change  we must respond appropriately or risk losing market share to direct competitors and or other forms of entertainment 

table of contents at daytona  the city commission of daytona beach unanimously approved our planned master development application  which is the first step in the pursuit of potential redevelopment projects at the world center of racing 
while many aspects of the project are yet to be determined  such a project could include a complete overhaul of the entire frontstretch grandstand of the legendary speedway  creating a world class motorsports entertainment facility including features such as new seats  suites and guest amenities  as well as new entry points  improved fan conveyance  a modern exterior  first class interior areas  and a redesigned midway for fans 
there are multiple internal and external factors that will influence the economics and project feasibility 
any substantial increase in capex spend above recent levels will depend upon several factors such as a stable economic operating environment and  preferably  the sale of our staten island property 
depending upon the final scope of the project we undertake  our financial statements may be impacted with accelerated depreciation and future loss on impairment losses on disposals of long lived assets resulting in removal of assets prior to the end of their actual useful life 
also  we have and we continue to expect to incur pre development costs that had and will continue to have an impact on our financial statements 
growth strategies our growth strategies also include exploring ways to grow our businesses through acquisitions and external developments that offer attractive financial returns 
this has been demonstrated through our joint venture to develop and operate a hollywood themed and branded entertainment destination facility overlooking turn two of kansas speedway see hollywood casino at kansas speedway

as a result of the foregoing  net income increased approximately million  or per diluted share  for fiscal as compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources general we have historically generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures at existing facilities  and return of capital through payments of an annual cash dividend and repurchase of our shares under our stock purchase plan 
in addition  we have used the proceeds from offerings of our class a common stock  the net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  borrowings under our credit facilities and state and local mechanisms to fund acquisitions and development projects 
at november   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million  million principal amount of senior notes outstanding  a debt service funding commitment of approximately million principal amount related to the taxable special obligation revenue tif bonds issued by the unified government of wyandotte county kansas city  kansas unified government  million principal term loan related to our headquarters office building the international motorsports center  or imc  and million principal amount of other third party debt 
at november   we had working capital of million  primarily supported by million of cash and cash equivalents 
at november   we had working capital of million  which was anchored by million of cash and cash equivalents 
our liquidity is primarily generated from our ongoing motorsports operations  and we expect our strong operating cash flow to continue in the future 
in addition  as of november   we have approximately million available to draw upon under our million revolving credit facility  if needed 
see future liquidity for additional disclosures relating to our credit facility and certain risks that may affect our near term operating results and liquidity 
allocation of capital is driven by our long term strategic planning and initiatives that encompass our mission  vision and values 
our primary uses of capital are to maintain modest debt levels that are consistent with our current investment grade debt rating from standard and poor s 
we will invest in our facilities to improve the guest experience and we will make investments in strategic projects that complement our core business and provide value for our shareholders  all of which is balanced with returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 
during fiscal year  our significant cash flow items include the following net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million  capital expenditures totaling approximately million  net proceeds of million related to long term debt  net payments of million related to our credit facility  contributions to the hollywood casino at kansas speedway joint venture  net of proceeds received  totaling approximately million  and dividends paid and reacquisitions of previously issued common stock totaling approximately million 
capital expenditures 
table of contents capital expenditures totaled approximately million for fiscal  for projects at our existing facilities related to grandstand seating enhancements at talladega  homestead and watkins glen  grandstand seating enhancements and rv improvements at daytona  rv improvements and paving at michigan  hospitality improvements at chicagoland and richmond  paving at phoenix  and a variety of other improvements and renovations 
in comparison  capital expenditures for fiscal totaled approximately million  which included approximately million for projects at our existing facilities and approximately million associated with other land purchases as well as the staten island property 
at november   we have approximately million remaining in capital projects currently approved for our existing facilities 
these projects include grandstand seating enhancements at talladega and daytona  grandstand improvements at richmond  improved restroom buildings at michigan  improvements at various facilities for expansion of parking  camping capacity and other uses  and a variety of other improvements and renovations to our facilities that enable us to effectively compete with other sports venues for consumer and corporate spending 
as a result of these currently approved projects and anticipated additional approvals in fiscal  we expect our total fiscal capital expenditures at our existing facilities will be approximately million to million depending on the timing of certain projects 
we review the capital expenditure program periodically and modify it as required to meet current business needs 
future liquidity general as discussed in future trends in operating results  economic conditions  including those affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  credit availability  interest rates and taxation rates  may impact our ability to sell tickets to our events and to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
we believe that adverse economic trends  particularly the sustained level of high unemployment and decreased consumer confidence  significantly contributed to the level of attendance for certain of our motorsports entertainment events during the recession beginning in absent a sustained improvement in consumer confidence that includes an increase in discretionary spending  we expect certain of these adverse trends to persist through fiscal  which we expect to have an impact on our business  especially attendance related and corporate partner revenues 
this may negatively impact year over year comparability for our revenue categories for the full year  with the exception of domestic broadcast media rights fees 
our cash flow from operations consists primarily of ticket  hospitality  merchandise  catering and concession sales and contracted revenues arising from television broadcast rights and marketing partnerships 
despite current economic conditions  we believe that cash flows from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund operations and approved capital projects at existing facilities for the foreseeable future  payments required in connection with the funding of the unified government s debt service requirements related to the tif bonds  payments related to our existing debt service commitments  equity contributions in connection with any future expansion of the hollywood casino at kansas speedway development  and our annual dividend and share repurchases under our stock purchase plan 
we remain interested in pursuing acquisition and or development opportunities that would increase shareholder value  the timing  size and success  as well as associated potential capital commitments of which  are unknown at this time 
accordingly  a material acceleration of our growth strategy could require us to obtain additional capital through debt and or equity financings 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that adequate debt and equity financing will be available on satisfactory terms 
while we expect our strong operating cash flow to continue in the future  our financial results depend significantly on a number of factors 
in addition to local  national  and global economic and financial market conditions  consumer and corporate spending could be adversely affected by security and other lifestyle conditions resulting in lower than expected future operating cash flows 
general economic conditions were significantly and negatively impacted by the september  terrorist attacks and the wars in iraq and afghanistan and could be similarly affected by any future attacks or fear of such attacks  or by conditions resulting from other acts or prospects of war 
any future attacks or wars or related threats could also increase our expenses related to insurance  security or other related matters 
also  our financial results could be adversely impacted by a widespread outbreak of a severe epidemiological crisis 
the items discussed above could have a singular or compounded material adverse affect on our financial success and future cash flow

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates in the normal course of business 
our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates and the libor rate 
in order to manage this exposure  from time to time we use a combination of debt instruments  including the use of derivatives in the form of interest rate swap and lock agreements 
we do not enter into any derivatives for trading purposes 
the objective of our asset management activities is to provide an adequate level of interest income and liquidity to fund operations and capital expansion  while minimizing market risk 
we utilize overnight sweep accounts and short term investments to minimize the interest rate risk 
we do not believe that our interest rate risk related to our cash equivalents and short term investments is material due to the nature of the investments 
our objective in managing our interest rate risk on our debt is to negotiate the most favorable interest rate structures that we can and  as market conditions evolve  adjust our balance of fixed and variable rate debt to optimize our overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
interest rate swaps and locks are used from time to time to convert a portion of our debt portfolio from a variable rate to a fixed rate or from a fixed rate to a variable rate as well as to lock in certain rates for future debt issuances 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to interest rate risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we have various debt instruments that are issued at fixed rates 
these financial instruments  which have a fixed rate of interest  are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
the fair values of long term debt are based on quoted market prices at the date of measurement 
our credit facilities approximate fair value as they bear interest rates that approximate market 
at november   we had no variable debt outstanding 

table of contents at november   the fair value of our total long term debt as determined by quotes from financial institutions was approximately million 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent shift in interest rates would be approximately million at november  credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts on a net basis 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default
