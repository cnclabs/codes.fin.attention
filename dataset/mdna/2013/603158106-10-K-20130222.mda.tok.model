worldwide sales were billion compared with billion in  a decrease of percent 
foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on sales of million or percentage points 
in addition to the impact of foreign exchange  several temporary and permanent paper and steel mill closures in europe and north america contributed to the sales decrease  which was partially offset by paper pcc sales from new satellite facilities and the continued ramp up of satellite facilities that began operations in the past year 
income from operations grew percent to million as compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was due to a strong operating performance highlighted by percent company wide productivity improvements  which resulted in savings of million  and a percent decrease  or million savings  in total overhead expenses 
in  the company continued to advance the execution of its growth strategies of geographic expansion and new product innovation and development 
during the year  we began operations in the fourth quarter of two new satellite plants  one in india and one in thailand 
in addition  we signed contracts for two new satellite pcc facilities in china 
the two new satellite facilities in china will add approximately  tons of production capacity and should be operational by the first quarter of six more commercial agreements were signed with paper mills for our fulfill tm portfolio of products bringing the total to ten as of december  we presently have eleven commercial contracts for fulfill 
in the fulfill program generated million of operating income 
we expect the contribution of our fulfill program to generate operating income between million and million in the refractory segment introduced a new  fourth generation lacam laser measurement system and expect additional lacam sales in we also signed an agreement with united steel company bsc sulb to perform all refractory maintenance at a greenfield steel mill in bahrain that started up in the third quarter of minteq  working with other refractory companies  is responsible for coordinating refractory maintenance of the steel furnaces and other steel production vessels 
we generated approximately million in revenue from this contract in and we expect to generate between million million per year of revenue over the year term of the contract 
the company balance sheet as of december  continues to be very strong 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were approximately million 
our cash flows from operations were approximately million in in addition  we had available lines of credit of million  our debt to equity ratio was  and our current ratio was we face some significant risks and challenges in the future the industries we serve  primarily paper  steel  construction and automotive  have been adversely affected by the uncertain global economic climate  primarily in europe 
although these markets have stabilized  our global business could be adversely affected by further decreases in economic activity 
our refractories segment primarily serves the steel industry 
although north american production improved slightly in as compared with the prior year  we saw declines in european steel production and it remains below levels 
in the paper industry  which is served by our paper pcc product line  production levels for printing and writing papers within north america and europe  our two largest markets were and below the prior year 
in addition  our processed minerals and specialty pcc product lines are affected by the domestic building and construction markets and the automotive market 
housing starts in averaged approximately thousand units  and were up from levels 
housing starts were at a peak rate of million units in some of our customers may experience mill shutdowns due to further consolidations  or may face liquidity issues  or bankruptcy  which could deteriorate the aging of our accounts receivable  increase our bad debt exposure and possibly trigger impairment of assets or realignment of our businesses 
consolidations and rationalizations in the paper and steel industries concentrate purchasing power in the hands of fewer customers  increasing pricing pressure on suppliers such as us 
most of our paper pcc sales are subject to long term contracts that may be terminated pursuant to their terms  or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us 
we are subject to volatility in pricing and supply availability of our key raw materials used in our paper pcc product line and refractory product line 
we continue to rely on china for a portion of our supply of magnesium oxide in the refractories segment  which may be subject to uncertainty in availability and cost 
fluctuations in energy costs have an impact on all of our businesses 
changes in the fair market value of our pension assets  rates of return on assets  and discount rates could continue to have a significant impact on our net periodic pension costs as well as our funding status 
as we expand our operations abroad we face the inherent risks of doing business in many foreign countries  including foreign exchange risk  import and export restrictions  and security concerns 
the company operations  particularly in the mining and environmental areas discharges  emissions and greenhouse gases  are subject to regulation by federal  state and foreign authorities and may be subject to  and presumably will be required to comply with  additional laws  regulations and guidelines which may be adopted in the future 
during the second quarter of  m real corporation announced plans to divest its alizay paper mill in france 
since that time  the mill has not been operating 
in january  double a paper company announced it had acquired the alizay mill 
while there can be no assurance  we expect to negotiate a contract and the paper mill to resume operations in the second half of in  sales from our alizay mill were approximately million 
during the third quarter of  newpage corporation filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
in  the company did business with five newpage mills  including operating three satellite pcc facilities at newpage locations 
in december  newpage emerged from the bankruptcy process and the company continues to supply pcc to these mills 
annual sales to newpage locations in were approximately million 
the company has evaluated these facilities for impairment of assets and  based upon the information currently available and probability weighted cash flows of various potential outcomes  has determined that no impairment charge was required in the fourth quarter 
outlook looking forward  we remain cautious about the state of the global economy  particularly in europe  and the impact it will have on our product lines 
although we saw market stabilization and improvement in  there remains uncertainty as to the sustainability of the upturn 
in  the company will continue to focus on innovation and new product development and other opportunities for sales growth as follows develop multiple high filler technologies  such as filler fiber  under the fulfill tm platform of products  to increase the fill rate in freesheet paper and continue to progress with commercial discussions and full scale paper machine trials 
increase our sales of pcc for paper by further penetration of the markets for paper filling at both freesheet and groundwood mills  particularly in emerging markets 
expand the company pcc coating product line using the satellite model 
promote the company expertise in crystal engineering  especially in helping papermakers customize pcc morphologies for specific paper applications 
expand pcc produced for paper filling applications by working with industry partners to develop new methods to increase the ratio of pcc for fiber substitutions 
develop unique calcium carbonates and talc products used in the manufacture of novel biopolymers  a new market opportunity 
deploy new talc and gcc products in paint  coating and packaging applications 
deploy value added formulations of refractory materials that not only reduce costs but improve performance 
expand our solid core wire product line into bric  middle eastern and other asian countries 
deploy our laser measurement technologies into new applications 
expand our refractory maintenance model to other steel makers globally 
deploy operational excellence principles into all aspects of the organization  including system infrastructure and lean principles 
explore selective acquisitions to fit our core competencies in minerals and fine particle technology 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of these opportunities

provision for taxes on income dollars in millions growth growth provision for taxes on income the company recorded provision for taxes on income of million in as compared with million in the previous year 
the effective tax rate for was as compared with in the prior year 
the increase in the tax rate in the current year primarily relates to a prior year favorable united states tax court case settlement and the resulting expiration of the statute of limitations of the tax years related to the tax court case 
the company recorded provision for taxes on income of million in as compared to million in the previous year 
the effective tax rate for was as compared with in the previous year 
the decrease in the tax rate in the current year primarily relates to a favorable united states tax court case settlement 
the factors having the most significant impact on our effective tax rates in recent periods are the rate differential related to foreign earnings indefinitely invested  percentage depletion  and the reversal of tax reserves as a result of a tax court case settlement 
percentage depletion allowances tax deductions for depletion that may exceed our tax basis in our mineral reserves are available to us under the income tax laws of the united states for operations conducted in the united states 
the tax benefits from percentage depletion were million in  million in  and million in we operate in various countries around the world that have tax laws  tax incentives and tax rates that are significantly different than those of the united states 
many of these differences combine to move our overall effective tax rate higher or lower than the united states statutory rate depending on the mix of income relative to income earned in the united states 
the effects of foreign earnings and the related foreign rate differentials resulted in a decrease of income tax expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase of income tax benefits in as compared with results from the change in the mix of earnings in the foreign jurisdictions in  statutory rate changes and a change in the amount of local income and tax adjustments

liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided from operations in were used principally to fund million of capital expenditures  and repurchase million in treasury shares 
cash provided from operating activities totaled million in as compared with million in the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily due to higher net income and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by increased pension plan funding 
included in cash flow from operations was pension plan funding of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
trade working capital is defined as trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable and inventories 
our total days of trade working capital increased to days from days in primarily due to higher receivables and lower payables in our refractories segment 
the funding status of the company pension plans was approximately at december  and we have met all minimum funding requirements 
the funding status at december  was 
the reduction in our funding status was due to a large increase in the projected benefit obligation from a change in the discount rate 
in  the company board of directors authorized the company management to repurchase  at its discretion  up to million of additional shares over a two year period 
as of december    shares have been repurchased under this program for million  or an average price of approximately per share 
on january   the company board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend on its common stock of per share 
no dividend will be payable unless declared by the board and unless funds are legally available for payment thereof 
the company is required to make future payments under various contracts  including debt agreements and lease agreements 
the company also has commitments to fund its pension plans and provide payments for other postretirement benefit plans 
a summary of the company outstanding contractual obligations as of december  is as follows contractual obligations payments due by period millions of dollars total after debt interest related to long term debt estimated pension and post retirement plan funding other long term liabilities operating lease obligations total contractual obligations long term debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding long term debt  including current portion 
maturities for long term debt extend to the company million of private placement debt will mature in october the company expects to refinance these notes 
interest related to long term debt is based on interest rates in effect as of december  and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to as the contractual interest rates for certain debt are variable  actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table 
estimated minimum required pension funding and post retirement benefits are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates  long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases  and health care cost trend rates 
the company has determined that it is not practicable to present expected pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond and  accordingly  no amounts have been included in the table beyond such dates 
other long term liabilities include asset retirement obligations 
the company will be contractually required to retire intangible long lived assets at its pcc satellite facilities and mining operations 
the company has several non cancelable operating leases  primarily for office space and equipment 
operating lease obligations includes future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable leases 
we have million in uncommitted short term bank credit lines  of which million was in use at december  the credit lines are primarily in the us  with approximately million or outside the us 
the credit lines are generally one year in term at competitive market rates at large well established institutions 
the company typically uses its available credit lines to fund working capital requirements or local capital spending needs 
at the present time  we have no indication that the financial institutions would be unable to commit to these lines of credit should the need arise 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for should be between million to million  principally related to the construction of pcc plants and other opportunities that meet our strategic growth objectives 
we expect to meet our other long term financing requirements from internally generated funds  uncommitted bank credit lines and  where appropriate  project financing of certain satellite plants 
the aggregate maturities of long term debt are as follows million  million  million  million  million  thereafter million 
the company debt to capital ratio is  which is well below the only financial covenant ratio in its debt agreements 
the total amount of contingent obligations associated with gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions  including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits  was million at december  payment of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities 
due to the difficulty in determining the timing of settlements  these obligations are not included in the table above 
we do not expect to make a tax payment related to these obligations within the next year that would significantly impact liquidity 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  valuation of long term assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  pension plan assumptions  income taxes  asset retirement obligations  income tax valuation allowances  stock based compensation  and litigation and environmental liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue from sale of products is recognized at the time the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer 
in most of our pcc contracts  the price per ton is based upon the total number of tons sold to the customer during the year 
under those contracts  the price billed to the customer for shipments during the year is based on periodic estimates of the total annual volume that will be sold to the customer 
revenues are adjusted at the end of each year to reflect the actual volume sold 
there were no significant revenue adjustments in the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
we have consignment arrangements with certain customers in our refractories segment 
revenues for these transactions are recorded when the consigned products are consumed by the customer 
revenues from sales of equipment are recorded upon completion of installation and receipt of customer acceptance 
revenues from services are recorded when the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from companies in the paper  construction and steel industries 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
such allowance is established through a charge to the provision for bad debt expenses 
we recorded bad debt expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition to specific allowances established for bankrupt customers  we also analyze the collection history and financial condition of our other customers considering current industry conditions and determine whether an allowance needs to be established or adjusted 
property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment are depreciated over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management estimates of the period that the assets can generate revenue  which does not necessarily coincide with the remaining term of a customer contractual obligation to purchase products made using those assets 
our sales of pcc are predominately pursuant to long term evergreen contracts  initially ten years in length  with paper mills at which we operate satellite pcc plants 
the terms of many of these agreements have been extended  often in connection with an expansion of the satellite pcc plant 
failure of a pcc customer to renew an agreement or continue to purchase pcc from our facility could result in an impairment of assets or accelerated depreciation at such facility 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the possible impairment of long lived assets and identifiable amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  market capitalization below invested capital 
the goodwill balance for each reporting unit as of december  and  respectively  was as follows in millions december  december  pcc processed minerals refractories total annually  the company performs a qualitative assessment for each of its reporting units to determine if the two step process for impairment testing is required 
if the company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the company then evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
step one involves a developing the fair value of total invested capital of each reporting unit in which goodwill is assigned  and b comparing the fair value of total invested capital for each reporting unit to its carrying amount  to determine if there is goodwill impairment 
should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value  then the step one test is failed  and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under step two 
the amount of impairment loss is determined in step two by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the company has three reporting units  pcc  processed minerals and refractories 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
in the fourth quarter of  the company performed a qualitative assessment of each of its reporting units and determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was less than their carrying values 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences and forecasted operating earnings 
these sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates 
we use our historical experience and business forecasts to provide insight 
amounts recorded for deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
such year end amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods 
to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered  a valuation allowance is established 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes  for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions 
pension benefits we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering the majority of employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and actuarial models which attempt to estimate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these models include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management best judgment regarding future expectations 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants  among other things 
differences from these assumptions may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense liability recorded by us follows a one percentage point change in our major assumptions would have the following effects effect on expense millions of dollars discount rate salary scale return on asset increase decrease effect on projected benefit obligation millions of dollars discount rate salary scale increase decrease the investment strategy for pension plan assets is to maintain a broadly diversified portfolio designed to both preserve and grow plan assets to meet future plan obligations 
the company average rate of return on assets from inception through december  was over 
the company assets are strategically allocated among equity  debt and other investments to achieve a diversification level that dampens fluctuations in investment returns 
the company long term investment strategy is an investment portfolio mix of approximately in equity securities and in fixed income securities 
as of december   the company had approximately of its pension assets in equity securities and in fixed income securities 
in  a net charge of million million after tax was recorded in other comprehensive loss  primarily due to a change in discount rates 
in  a net charge of million million after tax was recorded in other comprehensive loss  primarily due to lower discount rates and lower returns on plan assets 
in  a net charge of million million after tax was recorded in other comprehensive loss  primarily due to changes in plan assumptions 
we recognized pension expense of million in as compared to million in  due primarily to higher amortization of recognized actuarial losses 
accounting guidance on retirement benefits requires companies to discount future benefit obligations back to today dollars using a discount rate that is based on high quality fixed income investments 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the pension benefit obligation  while an increase in the discount rate decreases the pension benefit obligation 
this increase or decrease in the pension benefit obligation is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently amortized into earnings as an actuarial gain or loss 
the guidance also requires companies to use an expected long term rate of return on plan assets for computing current year pension expense 
differences between the actual and expected returns are also recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently amortized into earnings as actuarial gains and losses 
at the end of  total actuarial losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for pension plans were million  as compared to million in the majority of the actuarial losses were due to decreases in the discount rate in and and lower actual rates of return on assets than expected during the financial crisis of actuarial losses for pensions will be impacted in future periods by actual asset returns  discount rate changes  actual demographic experience and other factors that impact these expenses 
these losses  reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  will generally be amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the benefit plans 
at the end of  the average remaining service period of active employees or life expectancy for fully eligible employees was years 
we expect our amortization of net actuarial losses to increase by approximately million in as compared to  primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate 
we expect our pension expense to be approximately million in asset retirement obligations we currently record the obligation for estimated asset retirement costs at fair value in the period incurred 
factors such as expected costs and expected timing of settlement can affect the fair value of the obligations 
a revision to the estimated costs or expected timing of settlement could result in an increase or decrease in the total obligation which would change the amount of amortization and accretion expense recognized in earnings over time 
a one percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
a one percent increase or decrease in the inflation rate would change the total obligation by approximately million 
stock based compensation the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on their date of grant 
this model is based upon assumptions relating to the volatility of the stock price  the life of the option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
of these  stock price volatility and option life require greater levels of judgment and are therefore critical accounting estimates 
we used a stock price volatility assumption based upon the historical and implied volatility of the company stock 
we believe this is a good indicator of future  actual and implied volatilities 
for stock options granted in the period ended december   the company used a volatility assumption of 
the expected life calculation was based upon the observed and expected time to post vesting forfeiture and exercise 
for stock options granted during the fiscal year ended december   the company used a year life assumption 
the company believes the above critical estimates are based upon outcomes most likely to occur 
if we were to simultaneously increase or decrease the option life by one year and the volatility by basis points  recognized compensation expense would have changed approximately million in either direction for the year ended december  for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  beginning on page f this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on us 
however  in recent years both business segments have been affected by rapidly rising raw material and energy costs 
the company and its customers will typically negotiate reasonable price adjustments in order to recover a portion of these rapidly escalating costs 
as the contracts pursuant to which we construct and operate our satellite pcc plants generally adjust pricing to reflect increases in costs resulting from inflation  there is a time lag before such price adjustments can be implemented 
cyclical nature of customers businesses the bulk of our sales are to customers in the paper manufacturing  steel manufacturing and construction industries  which have historically been cyclical 
the pricing structure of some of our long term pcc contracts makes our pcc business less sensitive to declines in the quantity of product purchased 
however  we cannot predict the economic outlook in the countries in which we do business  nor in the key industries we serve

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in market prices and foreign currency and interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
we do not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
however  there can be no assurance that a sudden and significant change in the value of foreign currencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of our bank debt bears interest at variable rates  therefore our results of operations would only be affected by interest rate changes to such bank debt outstanding 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations over the next fiscal year 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
when appropriate  we enter into derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on our operating results 
the counterparties are major financial institutions 
such forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps would not subject us to additional risk from exchange rate or interest rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts would offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
we had open forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million and million of foreign currencies as of december  and  respectively 
these contracts matured in january and february of and january  respectively 
the fair value of these instruments at december  and december  was an asset of less than million and a liability of less than million  respectively 
in  the company entered into forward contracts to sell million euros as a hedge of its net investment in europe 
these contracts mature in october the fair value of these instruments at december  was an asset of million 
the fair value of these instruments at december  was an asset of million
