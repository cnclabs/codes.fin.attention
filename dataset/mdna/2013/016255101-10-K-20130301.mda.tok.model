item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview align technology  inc is a global medical device company that pioneered the invisible orthodontics market with the introduction of the invisalign system in today  we are focused on designing  manufacturing and marketing innovative  technology rich products to help dental professionals achieve the clinical results they expect and deliver effective  convenient cutting edge dental treatment options to their patients 
align technology was founded in march and is headquartered in san jose  california with offices worldwide 
our international headquarters are located in amsterdam  the netherlands 
we have two operating segments clear aligner  known as the invisalign system  and scanner and cad cam services sccs  known as the itero intra oral scanners and orthocad services 
we received fda clearance in and began our first commercial sales of invisalign to us orthodontists in followed by u 
s general practitioner dentists gps in over the next decade  we introduced invisalign to the european market and japan  added distribution partners in asia pacific  latin america  and emea  and introduced a full range of treatment options including invisalign express  invisalign teen  invisalign assist  and vivera retainers 
by  we launched invisalign g and invisalign g  which includes significant new aligner and software features across all invisalign products that make it easier for doctors to use invisalign on more complex cases  and introduced invisalign to the people s republic of china 
most recently  we launched smarttrack  the next generation of invisalign clear aligner material which became the new standard aligner material for invisalign clear aligner products in north america and europe beginning january  and for other international markets where we have received regulatory approval in the first quarter of in  we acquired cadent holdings  inc  a leading provider of d digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry  and makers of the itero intra oral scanner and orthocad services 
we believe that the combination of align s and cadent s technologies and capabilities creates greater growth opportunities for align by bringing innovative new invisalign treatment tools to customers and by extending the value of intra oral scanning in dental practices 
intra oral scanners provide a dental chair side platform for accessing valuable digital diagnosis and treatment tools  with potential for enhancing accuracy of records  treatment efficiency  and the overall patient experience 
we believe there are numerous benefits for customers and the opportunity to accelerate the adoption of invisalign through interoperability with our intra oral scanners 
the use of digital technologies such as cad cam for restorative dentistry or in office restorations has been growing rapidly and intra oral scanning is a critical part of enabling these new digital technologies and procedures in dental practices 
since the acquisition  we have launched significant product options and software enhancements to the scanner product line 
in late  we commercially launched the invisalign outcome simulator  the first invisalign chair side application powered by the itero scanner 
the interactive application provides dentists and orthodontists an enhanced platform for patient education and is designed to increase treatment acceptance by helping patients visualize the benefits possible with invisalign treatment 
the new itero scanner was available in north america beginning in february and will be available soon thereafter in select international markets as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures 
the invisalign system is offered in more than countries and has been used to treat more than million patients 
our itero intra oral scanner is available in over countries and provide dental professionals with an open choice to send digital impressions to any laboratory based cad cam system or to any of the more than  dental labs worldwide 
our goal is to establish the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish our intra oral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for d digital scans  ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals 
we intend to achieve this by focusing on the key strategic initiatives set forth in the business strategy section in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the successful execution of our business strategy  there are a number of other factors which may affect our results in and beyond  which are described below product innovation and clinical effectiveness 
we recently announced the introduction of smarttrack  a proprietary  custom engineered  aligner material  designed to deliver gentle  more constant force to improve control of tooth movements with invisalign clear aligner treatment  will build on the success we have seen with invisalign g g and encourage even greater confidence and adoption in our customers practices 
although the introduction of smarttrack will result in higher cost of goods sold and reduction in gross margins in our clear aligner segment due to higher material costs  we believe these innovations are important contributors to increase utilization across our channels worldwide 
additionally  we recently introduced the new itero scanner  which is a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures  invisalign interoperability  as well as the invisalign outcome simulator  our first chair side application powered by our itero scanner 
we believe that over the long term these types of product and clinical innovations will increase adoption of invisalign and increase sales of our intra oral scanners 
however  it is difficult to predict the rate of adoption which may vary by region and channel 
invisalign utilization rates 
our goal is to establish invisalign as the treatment of choice for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption and frequency of use by dental professionals  or utilization 
our quarterly utilization rates for the previous quarters are as follows 
autilizationgraph 
jpg 
invisalign utilization rates of cases shipped divided by of doctors cases were shipped to total utilization in the fourth quarter of decreased slightly to cases per doctor compared to cases in the third quarter driven primarily by the decrease in utilization by our north american orthodontic customers from to cases per doctor as well as expansion of our submitting international customers 
this decrease by our north american orthodontic customers reflects a decline in the number of teen aged cases shipped as teen case starts are down in the fourth quarter following the seasonally busier summer months 
although we expect that over the long term our utilization rates will gradually improve  we expect that period over period comparisons of our utilization rates will fluctuate 
number of new invisalign doctors trained 
we continue to expand our invisalign customer base through training new doctors 
in  invisalign growth was driven primarily by the continued expansion of our customer base as we trained a total of  new orthodontists and gps in north america and internationally 
we expect to train approximately  doctors in international clear aligner 
we will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of our products by dental professionals in our core european markets as well as expansion into new markets 
on a year over year basis  international volume increased  driven primarily by growth in our direct business in europe as well as by continued strong performance by our distribution partners 
although sales through our distribution partners represented of total worldwide case shipments in  sales through our distributors  particularly our partner covering the asia pacific region  continued to grow at a faster rate than direct sales in other international geographic regions and we expect this trend to continue in the near term 
based on the continued progress in the asia pacific region  we expect to revert to a direct sales model in this region beginning in the second quarter of therefore  we will not renew our distribution agreement when it expires in april as a result  on may   four of the largest indirect country markets of australia  new zealand  hong kong and singapore will revert back to a direct sales region and we will begin to recognize direct sales of invisalign products sold in that region at our full average selling price asp rather than at the discounted average sales price under the distribution agreement 
in  this distributor accounted for approximately of worldwide revenues  and we expect them to become an even more meaningful contributor to revenue growth beginning in may in the near term  however  the assumption of the direct operating costs will offset the uplift to asps 
although we expect volumes and revenues will increase  we may experience difficulties in achieving the anticipated financial benefits 
we expect the remaining eight indirect country markets in brunei  indonesia  macau  malaysia  philippines  south korea  taiwan  thailand and vietnam as well as the emea and latin america regions will continue under a distribution model 
increased sales force coverage 
our direct sales organization in north america is comprised of a team of territory managers and to a lesser extent  territory specialists 
these territory specialists are used to enhance coverage in larger territories  especially with our lower volume gp customers 
due to the success of this sales coverage model  in we expect to add approximately sales representatives in  predominantly in north america 
in addition  when we transition our asia pacific distributor to a direct sales model in may  we will acquire approximately additional sales representatives in that region 
vivera retainer shipment consolidation in north america 
in the first quarter of  we began consolidating vivera retainer product shipments into one shipment per year rather than four shipments per year as had been our practice 
as a result  our first quarter results will reflect approximately million benefit to revenue associated with our vivera product as we will recognize nine additional months of the subscription revenue in the first quarter instead of recognizing it ratably every quarter for one year 
in addition  we will also begin to reduce freight costs as we make this change 
international scanner and cad cam services 
in october  we reached a mutual agreement to terminate the exclusive distribution arrangement with straumann for itero intra oral scanners in europe  as well as the non exclusive distribution agreement for itero intra oral scanners in north america effective december  the global market for restorative dentistry is far more fragmented and complex than orthodontics with hundreds of thousands of labs  suppliers  general dentists and specialists 
in europe  adoption of digital restorative technology has been slowed due to challenging economic conditions and reluctance to invest in capital equipment 
in view of these conditions  we expect to have very few scanner sales internationally in the near term as we determine the most effective way to re stage growth in this market 
our direct sales model remains unchanged in north america where most of the scanner and cad cam services revenue is generated 
increase in invisalign selling price 
in recent years  we have significantly increased investment in research and development resulting in product innovations  such as invisalign g  invisalign g and smarttrack clear aligner material 
we have also continued to increase our consumer advertising spending to drive more patient demand 
in addition  beginning january   the federal government imposed a new excise tax on medical device manufacturers  and invisalign clear aligners are considered a taxable medical device 
as a result of this new tax and our continued investments in research and development and consumer advertising  we increased our invisalign pricing by adding to per case compared to prices  effective january  for  we expect that the impact on our average sales price from this price increase will be offset somewhat by an expected increases in our rebate program due to the anticipated increase in utilization by our customers  increased volume from our lower price products  including invisalign express and invisalign i  as well as slightly higher material costs for the smarttrack clear aligner material 
the prices for invisalign teen  invisalign retainers  and vivera retainers will remain unchanged 
operating expenses 
we expect operating expenses to increase in compared to due to the increase in north american sales force coverage  the acquisition of the direct sales force in asia pacific  and the inclusion of the medical device excise tax  which was enacted into law as part of the comprehensive healthcare reform legislation in march balance sheet reclassification 
subsequent to our results of operations and financial conditions on form k filed with the sec on january   we have made a million reclassification of deferred revenues  which is a short term liability to long term deferred revenues which is included in other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet presented in this form k 
this reclassification was not considered to be material and did not have an impact to our consolidated statement of cash flows or operations for foreign exchange rates 
although the us dollar is our reporting currency  a portion of our net revenues and income are generated in foreign currencies 
net revenues and income generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the us are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and as a result are affected by changes in exchange rates 
we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of net revenues and income in our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net revenues by reportable segment comparison for years ended december   and we group our operations into two reportable segments clear aligner segment and scanners and cad cam services segment 
our clear aligner segment consists of our invisalign system which includes invisalign full  express lite  teen  assist  vivera retainers  along with our training and ancillary products for treating malocclusion 
our scanners and cad cam services segment consists of intra oral scanning systems and additional services available with the intra oral scanners that provide digital alternatives to the traditional cast models 
this segment includes our itero scanner and orthocad services 
the below represents net revenues for our clear aligner segment by region  channel  and product and our scanner and cad cam services segment by region and product for the years ended december   and as follows in millions years ended december  clear aligner net change change net change change region and channel north america ortho gp total north america international invisalign teen deferred revenue release n a n a invisalign non case revenues total product invisalign full invisalign express lite invisalign teen invisalign assist invisalign non case revenues total scanners and cad cam services region north america n a international n a total n a product scanners n a cad cam services n a total n a total revenue n a in the fourth quarter of  we identified an error that the actual case refinement usage rate was lower than our estimate and  as a result  we recorded a net revenue release of million previously deferred for case refinement of which million was a correction of an error of which million relates to the first three quarters for the fiscal year and million relates to the fiscal year the adjustment was not material to any quarter within the net amount of million is not material to the results of operations for twelve months ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  includes a million release of revenue previously deferred for invisalign teen replacement aligners 
excluding the million for the invisalign teen replacement aligners  the percentage change from to was approximately 
as the acquisition of cadent closed on april   the year ended december  balances for scanners and cad cam services only reflect eight months of revenues 
clear aligner case volume by channel and product case volume data which represents invisalign case shipments by channel and product  for the years ended december   and as follows in thousands years ended december  region and channel net change change net change change north america ortho gp total north american invisalign international invisalign total invisalign case volume product invisalign full invisalign express lite invisalign teen invisalign assist total invisalign case volume fiscal year compared to fiscal year total net revenues increased million in primarily as a result of volume growth of across all regions and customer channels in our clear aligner segment and the inclusion of a full year of scanner and cad cam services sccs segment activity in compared to eight months in clear aligner revenue from our clear aligner segment  increased by due to increased case volumes across all products partially offset by lower asp 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the actual case refinement usage rate was lower than our estimate and  as a result  invisalign revenue includes the release of million of revenue previously deferred for case refinement refer to item on this form k for further discussion 
north american revenue growth of was driven by increased volumes of in the ortho channel and gp channels due to higher utilization and an increased number of doctors submitting cases 
asp were slightly lower due to increased discounting from our volume rebate program and a product mix shift towards our lower priced products 
international revenue growth of was mainly due to volume increases of across all products offset by lower asp due to higher discounts  unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a product mix shift towards distributor sales and lower priced products 
invisalign non case revenues  consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products  were higher in compared to primarily due to increased sales of our vivera product and training 
scanner and cad cam services revenue from our scanner and cad cam services segment  consisting of scanner and cad cam services  increased by million as a result of million increase in north america revenue related to higher scanner volume from a full year of activity in compared to eight months in this is partially offset by a million decrease in international revenue due to lower scanner volume as a result of the termination of our exclusive distribution agreement with straumann for itero intra oral scanners 
the financial results of cadent have been included in this segment since the acquisition date on april  fiscal year compared to fiscal year total net revenues increased million in as a result of worldwide volume growth across all customer channels and the inclusion of our scanner and cad cam services segment 
geographically  both north america and international revenue increased by million due to an growth in case volume  favorable foreign exchange rates  and the inclusion of eight months of scanner and cad cam service revenues 
invisalign case volume growth was driven by both improved utilization and an increase in the number of doctors submitting cases 
revenue from our clear aligner segment  consisting of our invisalign products  increased by as a result of additional case volumes across all products 
the most significant volume percentage increases were in the invisalign teen and assist products 
although invisalign teen case volume increased  revenue for invisalign teen was comparable to the prior year primarily because of the million release of deferred revenue in invisalign assist revenue growth was comprised of both an increase in case volume and additional revenue being recognized as each batch is shipped over the course of treatment instead of deferring until the final batch shipment 
additionally  invisalign non case revenues  consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products  were higher in compared to primarily due to increased sales of our vivera product 
since date of the acquisition until the end of the fiscal year end  the scanner and cad cam services segment generated million of revenue from sales of itero and ioc scanners and orthocad services

cost of net revenues for our clear aligner and sccs includes salaries for staff involved in the production process  the cost of materials  packaging  shipping costs  depreciation on capital equipment used in the production process  amortization of acquired intangible assets from cadent  training costs and stock based compensation expense 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year clear aligner gross margin remained fairly consistent compared to largely benefiting from higher sales volume that resulted in a decrease in cost per case offset by lower asps 
scanner and cad cam services gross margin improved slightly in compared to primarily resulting from lower acquisition  integration  and exit costs partially offset by lower asps from our scanners as well as higher training costs 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross margin decreased in compared to primarily due to the acquisition of our scanner and cad cam services segment from cadent  which carries a lower margin at approximately compared to for our clear aligner segment 
compared to  our clear aligner gross margin remained flat due to higher cost per case resulting from higher material costs which was partially offset by higher case volumes 
we also incurred amortization costs related to the acquired technology from cadent of approximately million and exit costs related to the consolidation of our new jersey operations of approximately million for the year ended december  sales and marketing in millions years ended december  change change sales and marketing of net revenues sales and marketing expense includes sales force and marketing compensation including travel related costs  media and advertising  clinical education  expenses for trade shows and industry events  product marketing and stock based compensation expense 
sales and marketing expense increased in compared to due primarily due to higher payroll and payroll related costs of approximately million which was largely attributable to the inclusion of cadent headcount for the full twelve months of as compared to only eight months in we also incurred higher costs related to advertising and industry events of approximately million 
sales and marketing expense increased in compared to due to compensation costs of approximately million that were related to an increase in headcount as well as the inclusion of cadent sales and marketing personnel 
additionally  we incurred higher clinical education costs primarily related to our international launch of invisalign g  media and advertising related target tv advertising  and travel related costs of approximately million 
general and administrative in millions years ended december  change change general and administrative of net revenues general and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel  outside consulting services  legal expenses and stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expense for increased compared to largely due to higher legal and consulting fees of approximately million related to ongoing litigation 
we also incurred higher facility related expenses of approximately million as a result of the inclusion of cadent operations for a full twelve months in compared to only eight months during our payroll and payroll related expenses were also higher by million mainly due to our annual compensation adjustments and an increase in headcount 
these costs were partially offset by lower consulting  accounting and legal fees of approximately million that were directly related to the acquisition of cadent in and lower amortization expense of approximately million related to our non compete agreements which were fully amortized in general and administrative expense for increased compared to primarily due to compensation costs of approximately million resulting from compensation and related benefits and increased in headcount due to the cadent acquisition 
we also incurred higher consulting  accounting  legal  and travel costs of approximately million which was primarily related to the acquisition and integration of cadent into our business operations 
research and development in millions years ended december  change change research and development of net revenues research and development expense includes the personnel related costs and outside consulting expenses associated with the research and development of new products and enhancements to existing products  corporate allocations  facility and facility related costs  conducting clinical and pre commercialization trials and testing and stock based compensation expense 
research and development expense increased in compared to primarily due to payroll and payroll related costs of approximately million which was largely attributed to the inclusion of cadent headcount for the full twelve months of compared to only eight months in research and development expense increased in compared to primarily due to higher compensation costs of approximately million as a result of increased headcount due to the cadent acquisition 
in addition  we paid million related to the cadent joint development agreement that we entered into in january before the completion of the acquisition in april we also incurred higher travel and outside service costs of approximately million 
impairment of goodwill in millions years ended december  change change impairment of goodwill of net revenues during the third quarter of  we determined that the goodwill for our sccs reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests since an event occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our sccs reporting unit below its carrying amount 
as a result of our analysis  we recorded a preliminary goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of of million and an additional million during the fourth quarter of  representing a change in estimate upon finalizing our annual budget process  for a total impairment charge of million 
none of the goodwill impairment charge was deductible for tax purposes  and there was no additional impairment that resulted from our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of refer to note for details of the impairment analysis 
litigation settlement costs in millions years ended december  change change litigation settlement costs on october   we entered into a memorandum of understanding to resolve a complaint filed by dr 
leiszler 
as a result  we recorded a total litigation settlement charge of million in for settlement costs 
there were no litigation settlement costs in and insurance settlement in millions years ended december  change change insurance settlement in june  we received an million insurance settlement over a disputed coverage under our general liability umbrella that was not previously reimbursed by our insurer related to the orthoclear litigation 
there were no insurance settlements in or amortization of acquired intangible assets in millions years ended december  change change amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets increased in compared to reflecting a full twelve months of amortization expense for related to the cadent acquisition in april compared to only eight months in amortization of acquired intangibles for was approximately million which were related to trademarks and customer relationships that were acquired as part of the cadent acquisition in interest income and other expense  net in millions years ended december  change change interest income other expense  net total interest income and other expense  net interest income and other expense  net  include interest income earned on cash balances  interest expense  foreign currency translation gains and losses and other miscellaneous charges 
interest income in was largely consistent with other expense  net increased in compared to by million reflecting increase in foreign exchange losses during interest income in was consistent with other expense  net decreased in compared to by million reflecting increase in foreign exchange gain during provision for income taxes in millions years ended december  change change provision for income taxes effective tax rates the effective tax rate was   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
our effective tax rates in these fiscal years differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of due to certain foreign earnings  primarily from costa rica  which are subject to a lower tax rate  and foreign tax credits  partially offset by state income tax expense  the tax impact of certain stock based compensation charges and  in fiscal year  impairment of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes 
as of december   approximately million of undistributed earnings from non us operations held by our foreign subsidiaries are designated as permanently reinvested outside the us accordingly  no additional us income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes have been provided thereon 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it is not more likely than not that we expect to recover our deferred tax assets  we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
the available positive evidence at december  included historical operating profits and a projection of future income 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of approximately million  mostly related to foreign net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets because we cannot forecast sufficient future foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets 
these net operating loss carryforwards will result in an income tax benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized at some point in the future 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which  if not used  will begin to expire in these net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code  but are expected to be fully realized 
furthermore  we have california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which  if not used  will begin to expire in at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal purposes and million for california state tax purposes 
if not utilized  the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
on january   president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of  which would retroactively extend the federal research tax credit for two years through december  as a result  we expect to record a favorable benefit of approximately million during the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations from product sales and the proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
as of december   and  we had the following cash and cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments in thousands years ended december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments total cash flows in thousands years ended december  net cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments which include corporate bonds  us dollar denominated foreign corporate bonds  and us government agency bonds 
as of december   approximately million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we have not provided additional us income taxes or additional foreign withholding taxes on approximately million of undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings that are intended to be permanently reinvested outside the us million of the total undistributed foreign earnings relate to costa rica 
in the event such earnings are repatriated to the us  the earnings would be subject to additional us income taxes reduced by any foreign taxes paid 
operating activities for the year ended december   cash flows from operations of million resulted primarily from our net income of approximately million million as well as the following non cash activities impairment of goodwill related to our sccs reporting unit was million 
stock based compensation was million related to our equity incentive compensation granted to employees 
depreciation and amortization were million related to our fixed assets and acquired intangible assets 
deferred taxes were million primarily due to the utilization of deferred tax assets 
excess tax benefit from our share based payments were million 
other non cash activities were million 
changes in working capital accounts receivable increased by million due to the increase in revenues during  reducing our cash inflow from operating activities 
inventories increased by million which was primarily due to increased production volumes for our intra oral scanner products for the move to our new facility in israel as well as procuring the new smarttrack material for our clear aligners  increasing our cash outflow from operating activities 
prepaid expenses and other assets increased million primarily due to the timing of software license and insurance policy renewals  increasing our cash outflow from operations 
accrued and other long term liabilities increased by million primarily due to higher deferred tax liabilities  decreasing our cash outflow from operations 
deferred revenue increased by million primarily due to higher sales with deferred revenue components in  increasing our cash inflow from operations 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operations of million resulted primarily from our net income of approximately million and the following reasons non cash activities stock based compensation of million 
other non cash activities including depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes  provision for doubtful accounts  amortization of intangible assets  benefits from tax provision for our share based payments  and loss on the retirement disposal of our fixed assets of million 
changes in working capital accrued and other long term liabilities increased by million primarily due to the an increase of compensation and related employee benefits  income tax payable and other sales and marketing costs  decreasing our cash outflow from operations 
deferred revenue increased by million primarily due to higher sales with deferred revenue components in  increasing our cash inflow from operations 
accounts receivable increased by million due to the increase in revenues during  reducing our cash inflow from operating activities 
other working capital comprising of inventories  prepaid expenses and other assets  and accounts payable  resulted in a net decrease of million  increasing our cash inflow from operations 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operations of million resulted primarily from our net income of approximately million and the following reasons non cash activities deferred taxes increased by million primarily due to the utilization of our deferred tax assets 
other non cash activities including depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  provision for doubtful accounts  benefits from tax provision for our share based payments  and loss on the retirement disposal of our fixed assets resulted in a net increase of million 
changes in working capital accounts receivable increased by million due to the increase in revenues during  reducing our cash inflow from operating activities 
accrued and other long term liabilities increased by million primarily due to the leiszler class action settlement and an increase of our income tax payable and other sales and marketing costs  decreasing our cash outflow from operations 
deferred revenue increased by million primarily due to higher sales with deferred revenue components in  increasing our cash inflow from operations 
other working capital comprising of inventories  prepaid expenses and other assets  and accounts payable  resulted in a net decrease of million  increasing our cash inflow from operations 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily consisted of our purchase of marketable securities of million and property and equipment purchases of million 
these costs were partially offset by net maturities of marketable securities of million and the release of million of funds related to unclaimed merger consideration for the acquisition of cadent on april  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily consisted of our cash paid for the acquisition of cadent of approximately million and approximately million of property  plant  and equipment purchases 
we also had restricted cash of approximately million which primarily represents funds we hold as unclaimed merger consideration related to the acquisition of cadent on april  these costs were partially offset by net maturities of marketable securities and the proceeds from the sale of equipment of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily consisted of approximately million for purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment which was partially offset by net maturities of our marketable securities of million 
although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of impairment  we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  resulting from approximately million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately million from excess tax benefit from our share based compensation arrangements 
these proceeds were partially offset by approximately million common stock repurchases and million of taxes paid for our employees vesting of restricted stock units 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily resulting from approximately million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately million from excess tax benefit from our share based arrangements 
these proceeds were partially offset by approximately million common stock repurchases and million of taxes paid for our employees vesting of restricted stock units 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily resulting from approximately million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately million from excess tax benefit from our share based arrangements 
these proceeds were partially offset by approximately million of taxes paid for our employees vesting of restricted stock units 
net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity 
however  in  we began granting restricted stock units rsus which  unlike stock options  do not generate cash from exercises 
as a result  we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods 
in addition  because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest  the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf 
during   and  we paid million  million  and million of taxes related to rsus that vested during the period for executive officers  respectively 
stock repurchase on october   we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to million of common stock 
purchases under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million including commissions 
the common stock repurchases reduced additional paid in capital by approximately million and increased accumulated deficit by million 
all repurchased shares were retired 
as of december   there remains million under our existing stock repurchase authorization 
contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately million of non current uncertain tax benefits which are included in other long term obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december  we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities  if any 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item a as of december  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt securities combined with our positive cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows  we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy  business structure or operations 
accordingly  the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
indemnification provisions in the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products  we indemnify certain parties customers  vendors  lessors  and other parties with respect to certain matters  including  but not limited to  services to be provided by us and intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers that will require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers 
several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim 
it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
additionally  we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
however  to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future  future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 
as of december   we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  goodwill and finite lived assets and related impairment  and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue according to the accounting guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements in accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the financial accounting standard board fasb emerging issues task force 
multiple element arrangements meas arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables  including any combination of products equipment  services and extended warranties 
the deliverables included in the meas are separated into more than one unit of accounting when i the delivered product equipment has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  and ii delivery of the undelivered service element s is probable and substantially in our control 
arrangement consideration is then allocated to each unit  delivered or undelivered  based on the relative selling price rsp of each unit of accounting based first on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if it exists second on third party evidence tpe if it exists and on estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe or tpe exist 
vsoe in most instances  products are sold separately in stand alone arrangements 
services are also sold separately through renewals of contracts with varying periods 
we determine vsoe based on its pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately  considering geographical  customer  and other economic or marketing variables  as well as renewal rates or stand alone prices for the service element s 
tpe if we cannot establish vsoe of selling price for a specific product or service included in a multiple element arrangement  we use third party evidence of selling price 
we determine tpe based on sales of comparable amount of similar products or service offered by multiple third parties considering the degree of customization and similarity of product or service sold 
esp the estimated selling price represents the price at which we would sell a product or service if it were sold on a stand alone basis 
when vsoe does not exist for all elements  we determine esp for the arrangement element based on sales  cost and margin analysis  as well as other inputs based on its pricing practices 
adjustments for other market and company specific factors are made as deemed necessary in determining esp 
we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales  if any  in the period such sales occur 
we have not recorded any estimated losses for the periods presented 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 
clear aligner we enter into arrangements treatment plans that involve multiple future product deliverables 
for example  included in the price of invisalign full  invisalign teen and invisalign assist  we offer optional case refinement  which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient teeth to the desired final position 
case refinement may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment 
invisalign teen also includes up to six optional replacement aligners in the price of the product and may be ordered at any time throughout treatment 
we use vsoe adjusted by estimated usage rates for case refinements and replacement aligners to determine the relative selling price 
in the absence of vsoe  we determine our best estimate of selling price  as if it is sold on a stand alone basis  and take into consideration our pricing and discounting strategies  market conditions  as well as historical price 
we regularly review our estimates of selling price and maintain internal controls over the establishment and update of these estimates 
we determined that our treatment plans  except invisalign assist with progress tracking  are comprised of three possible deliverables that represent separate units of accounting single batched aligners  case refinement and replacement aligners 
we allocate revenue for each treatment plan based on each unit relative selling price and recognize the revenue upon the delivery of each unit in the treatment plan 
for invisalign assist with the progress tracking feature  aligners and services are provided to the dental professional every nine stages a batch 
beginning january   we were able to reliably estimate the number of batches which are expected to be shipped for each case based upon our historical experience 
the amounts allocated to this deliverable are recognized on a prorated basis as each batch is shipped 
prior to january   revenue was deferred upon the first batch shipment and was recognized upon the final batch shipment 
the vivera retainer includes four shipments per year  and revenue is recognized ratably as each shipment occurs 
in the first quarter of  we will begin to consolidate vivera retainer product shipments down to one shipment per year  compared to the current process of four shipments per year 
prior to january   we used vsoe as fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement and replacement aligner deliverables 
we deferred the fair value of case refinement and replacement aligner deliverables based on estimated usage rates and recognized the residual revenue upon initial batch shipment 
the deferred revenue was subsequently recognized as the refinement and replacement aligners were shipped 
scanners and cad cam services we recognize revenues from the sales of itero and ioc intra oral scanners and cad cam services 
cad cam services include scanning services  extended warranty for the intra oral scanners  a range of itero restorative services and orthocad services such as orthocad icast  orthocad iq  and orthocad irecord 
we sell intra oral scanners and services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners 
the intra oral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty  and for additional fees  the customer may select an unlimited scanning service agreement over a fixed period of time or extended warranty periods 
revenue  net of related discounts and allowances  is recognized when products or equipment have been shipped  installed and on site training completed  when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  title and risk of loss has passed to customers based on the shipping terms  no significant obligations remain  and allowances for discounts  returns  and customer incentives can be reliably estimated 
discounts are deducted from revenue at the time of sale or when the discount is offered  whichever is later and free cases or training is included as a deliverable in the multiple element arrangement assessment 
returns of products  excluding warranty related returns  are infrequent and insignificant 
services service revenue  including itero restorative and all orthocad services are recognized upon delivery or ratably over the contract term as the specified services are performed 
extended warranties we offer customers an option to purchase extended warranties on certain products 
we recognize revenue on these extended warranty contracts ratably over the life of the contract 
the costs associated with these extended warranty contracts are recognized when incurred 
when intra oral scanners are sold with either an unlimited scanning service agreement and or extended warranty  we allocate revenue based on each element relative selling price 
we estimate the selling price of each element  as if it is sold on a stand alone basis  taking into consideration historical prices as well as our pricing and discounting strategies 
we will continue to review our estimates as we continue to integrate cadent into our business 
revenues for unlimited scanning service agreements and extended warranty are recognized ratably over the service periods 
if a customer selects a pay per use basis for scanning service fees  the revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
for direct sales and sales to certain distributors  intra oral scanner revenue is recognized once the intra oral scanner has been installed and on site training is completed 
for other distributors who provide installation and training to the customer  we recognize scanner revenue when the intra oral scanner is shipped to the distributor assuming all of the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
stock based compensation expense we recognize stock based compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation and monte carlo simulation model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected term and stock price volatility 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
goodwill and finite lived acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the reporting units based on relative synergies generated 
our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of the cadent acquisition 
these assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of one to fifteen years  reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized 
impairment of goodwill  finite lived acquired intangible assets and long lived assets goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit are based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows under the income approach of the reporting units as well as various price or market multiples applied to the reporting unit operating results along with the appropriate control premium under the marketing approach  both of which are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy as described in note in our consolidated financial statements 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
interim testing we test our goodwill balances for impairment annually on november th or more frequently if indicators are present or circumstances change that suggest an impairment may exist 
during the third quarter of  we determined that the goodwill for our sccs reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual impairment tests since an event occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our sccs reporting unit below its carrying amount 
these indicators included the termination of an exclusive distribution arrangement with straumann for itero intra oral scanners in europe  as well as the termination of their non exclusive distribution arrangement for itero intra oral scanners in north america  together with market conditions and business trends within the sccs reporting unit 
while we continue to expect revenue growth in our sccs business  our expectations for future growth and profitability rates projected for the sccs reporting unit are lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by overall lower than expected financial results 
as a result  we performed step one analysis for our sccs reporting unit  which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the sccs reporting unit against its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to it 
in deriving the fair value of the sccs reporting unit  we utilized a combination of both the income and market approach  which are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy 
the income approach provides an estimate of fair value based on discounted expected future cash flows 
the market approach provides an estimate of fair value using various prices or market multiples applied to the reporting unit operating results and then applies an appropriate control premium in order to reconcile to our market capitalization 
as a result of our step one analysis  we concluded that the fair value of the sccs reporting unit was less than its carrying value  therefore  we proceeded to perform step two of the goodwill impairment analysis 
step two of the goodwill impairment analysis measures the impairment charge by allocating the reporting unit fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
this allocation process was performed only for the purposes of measuring the goodwill impairment  and not to adjust the carrying values of the recognized tangible assets and liabilities 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
based on our analysis  the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of the goodwill for the sccs reporting unit 
we recorded a preliminary goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of of million and an additional million during the fourth quarter of  representing a change in estimate upon finalizing our annual budget process  for a total impairment charge of million 
none of the goodwill impairment charge was deductible for tax purposes 
annual impairment test in addition to our interim goodwill testing for our sccs reporting unit  we also performed our annual goodwill impairment test for both our reporting units  clear aligner and sccs  on november th  in accordance with our accounting policy 
in step one  we compare the carrying value of our reporting units to the estimated fair value as determined by both the income and market approaches 
for our clear aligner reporting unit  we determined that the estimated fair value significantly exceeded its carrying value and therefore was not at risk for impairment 
for our sccs reporting unit  we concluded that the carrying value of this reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value  therefore  we proceeded to step two of the goodwill impairment analysis 
as a result  we performed step two of the goodwill impairment analysis to quantify the amount of impairment  if any  based on our analysis as of november  in this step  the estimated fair value of the entire sccs reporting unit was allocated to all of the assets and liabilities in a hypothetical analysis that calculated the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
the allocation process was performed only for purposes of measuring the goodwill impairment  and not to adjust the carrying values of recognized tangible assets or liabilities 
accordingly  we did not record any impairment charge under our step two analysis as the implied fair value of the allocated goodwill exceeded the carrying value as of november  by approximately 
a change in any one of the key assumptions as described below would result in an additional impairment a percentage point decrease to the discount rate used to determine the fair value of our customer relationship intangible asset 
a percentage point increase in the costs to support new customers which is factored in the fair value of our customer relationship intangible asset 
a one percentage point decrease in the terminal growth rate assumption in the discounted cash flow model used in the income approach 
in conjunction with our goodwill impairment test  we tested for recoverability of the sccs asset group including the carrying value of the intangible assets and concluded the asset group including the intangible assets was not impaired as determined by the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group under the long lived asset impairment guidance 
as such  no writedown of the intangible assets were recorded as of november th or during although no impairment existed for the intangible assets  because the carrying value of intangible assets included in step one of the goodwill impairment test are significantly higher than the hypothetical fair value of the reporting unit intangible assets used in step two of the goodwill impairment test  the sccs reporting unit will continue to fail step one of the goodwill impairment test 
we have determined that  for the foreseeable reporting periods  the sccs reporting unit will continue to fail step one of the goodwill impairment test but may pass step two 
in fiscal years and we performed the annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter for our reporting unit s and found no impairment as the fair value of our reporting unit s was significantly in excess of the carrying value 
finite lived intangible assets and long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets including finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
an asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate 
if an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair market value 
there were no asset impairments during  or accounting for income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the applicable tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we account for uncertain tax issues pursuant to authoritative guidance based on a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  or refinement of estimates 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which such determination is made 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if it is not more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets  we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
the available positive evidence at december  included historical operating profits and a projection of future income sufficient to realize most of our remaining deferred tax assets 
as of december   it was considered more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain foreign loss carryovers as we are unable to forecast sufficient future profits to realize the deferred tax assets 
accounting guidance for stock based compensation prohibits recognition of a deferred income tax asset for excess tax benefits due to stock option exercises that have not yet been realized through a reduction in income taxes payable 
such unrecognized deferred tax benefits totaled million as of december  and will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital  if and when realized through a reduction in income taxes payable 
we follow the tax law ordering method to determine when excess tax benefits have been realized and consider only the direct impacts of awards when calculating the amount of windfalls or shortfalls 
us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not provided for on a cumulative total of million of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries as of the end of the year ended december  we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries 
if these earnings were distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise  or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred  we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credit  and foreign withholding taxes 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable 
recent accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporated herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
our cash equivalents and investments are fixed rate short term and long term securities 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  and as a result  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately million invested in available for sale marketable securities 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 
we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december  and therefore  we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate increases 
currency rate risk we operate in north america  europe  asia pacific  costa rica and israel 
as a result of our international business activities  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets  and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
we sell our products in the local currency for the respective countries 
this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below 
regardless of this natural hedging  our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  where appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions 
the impact of an aggregate change of in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material
