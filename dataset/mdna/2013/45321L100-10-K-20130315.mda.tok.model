overview we are a pioneer and leader of a new category of business security solutions focused on providing visibility and control over high value business data across critical business systems within the data center 
our securesphere business security suite is a broad solution designed to prioritize and mitigate risks to high value business data  protect against hackers and malicious insiders  and address and streamline regulatory compliance 
securesphere is an integrated  modular suite  which provides database  file and web application security  and secures all business data across various systems in data centers  including traditional on premise data centers as well as private  public and hybrid cloud computing environments 
we also offer cloud based security services that deliver on demand and cost effective web application security 
we were founded in with the vision of protecting high value business data within the enterprise 
since that time we have been investing in our business security products to meet the rapidly evolving demands of customers 
we shipped our initial web application security and data security products in  in  we expanded our database security product to include compliance features  and in  we launched our file security offering 
in addition  in  we launched our cloud based initiatives with threatradar and  in  we introduced our cloud based offering for mid market enterprises and small and medium sized businesses smb that we provide through incapsula  inc  our majority owned subsidiary 
our research and development efforts are focused primarily on improving and enhancing our existing business security products and services  as well as developing new products and services and conducting advanced security research 
we conduct our research and development activities in israel  and we believe this provides us with access to some of the best engineering talent in the security industry 
as of december   we had employees dedicated to research and development  including our advanced security research group  the application defense center adc 
our research and development expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we derive our revenue from sales and licenses of our products and sales of our services 
products and license revenue is generated primarily from sales of perpetual software licenses installed on hardware appliances or virtual appliances for our securesphere business security suite 
services revenue consists of maintenance and support  professional services and training and subscriptions 
a majority of our revenue is derived from customers in the americas region 
in  of our total revenue was generated from the americas  from europe  middle east and africa emea and from asia pacific apac 

table of contents we market and sell our products through a hybrid sales model  which combines a direct touch sales organization and an overlay channel sales team that actively assist our extensive network of channel partners throughout the sales process 
we also provide our channel partners with marketing assistance  technical training and support 
we primarily sell our products and services through our channel partners  including distributors and resellers  which sell to end user customers  who we refer to in this annual report on form k as our customers 
we have a network of over channel partners worldwide  including both resellers and distributors 
in  our channel partners originated over  and fulfilled almost  of our sales

as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
opportunities  challenges and risks we believe that the growth of our business and our future success are dependent upon many factors  including our ability to maintain our technology leadership  improve our sales and marketing  address the needs of smaller enterprises and compete effectively in the marketplace for business security solutions 
while each of these areas presents significant opportunities for us  they also pose important challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our results of operations 
maintain technology leadership 
as a result of the rise in sophisticated attacks by hackers and malicious insiders  the difficulty in complying with regulations governing business data and the growing complexity of  and open access to  data centers  we believe that enterprises are struggling to provide visibility and control over business data that they need to protect 
we believe these challenges are driving the need for a new protection layer positioned closely around business data and systems in the data center 
we expect that as enterprises recognize the growing risk to high value business data and the need to comply with increasing regulatory compliance mandates  their spending will increase on solutions designed to control and protect such data 
we believe that traditional security and compliance products do not address the evolving needs of enterprises or do not do so adequately  and that this presents us with a large market opportunity 
to capitalize on this opportunity  we have introduced and expect that in the future we will need to continue to introduce innovations to our broad business security solutions 
we cannot assure you that our products will achieve widespread market acceptance or that we will properly anticipate future customer needs 
moreover  if our products do not satisfy evolving customer requirements  we will not capture the increase in spending that we expect will result from enterprises seeking to secure business data and systems 
invest in sales and marketing 
in order to capitalize on the anticipated increase in spending in the business security market  we will need to continue to invest significant resources to further strengthen our existing relationships with channel partners  extend our global network by adding new channel partners and grow our sales and marketing team 
any investments that we make in our sales and marketing will occur in advance of our experiencing any benefits from such investments  and so it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating our resources in this area 
we cannot assure you that the investments that we intend to make to strengthen our sales and marketing efforts will enable us to capitalize on the expected increase in spending in the business security market or result in an increase in revenue or an improvement in our results of operations 
address needs of smaller enterprises 
as market awareness of the benefits of a broad business security solution increases  we believe there is a significant opportunity to provide business security solutions to smaller enterprises as they confront increasing security threats and compliance mandates 
to capitalize on this opportunity  we intend to increase our business with mid market enterprises and smbs by expanding our cloud based service offerings and our distribution channel 
we have made  and may in the future continue to make  significant investments in our cloud based security products to address the business security needs of mid market enterprises and smbs 
if our cloud based security products  which are relatively new  fail to gain broad acceptance with mid market enterprises and smbs  our revenue growth  results of operations and competitive position in our industry could suffer 
compete effectively 
we operate in an intensely competitive market that has witnessed significant consolidation in recent years with large companies acquiring many of our competitors 
we track our success rate in competitive sales opportunities against certain competitors  some of which generate higher revenues and have greater market capitalizations than we do  and many of which are more established or have greater name recognition within our industry 
based upon our internal tracking of the results of such competitive sales opportunities  we believe that we have historically competed favorably against our larger competitors  and that we have a proven track record of successfully competing against such larger competitors 
nonetheless  some of our larger competitors have numerous advantages  including  but not limited to  greater financial resources  broader product offerings and more established relationships with channel partners and customers 
if we are unable to compete effectively for a share of the business security market  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents to date  we have incurred  and continue to incur  losses from operations and net losses 
however  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
further  we expect that  if we successfully execute our business plan and strategy  our loss from operations and our net losses will continue to decline  and that we will reach profitability 
should we need additional cash in the future  we may utilize existing lines of credit  enter into additional lines of credit or raise funds through the sale of equity securities 
key metrics of our business we monitor the key financial metrics discussed below to help us evaluate growth trends  establish budgets  measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies 
net revenue 
we measure our net revenue to assess the acceptance of our products from our customers  our growth in the markets we serve and to help us establish our strategic and operating plans for future periods 
we discuss the components of our net revenue in financial overview net revenue below 
gross margin 
we monitor our gross margin to assess the impact on our current and forecasted financial results from any changes to the pricing and mix of products we are selling to our customers 
loss from operations 
we track our loss from operations to assess how effectively we are planning and monitoring our operations as well as controlling our operational costs  which are primarily driven by headcount 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we evaluate the level of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to ensure we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations  including the development of future products and product enhancements and the expansion into new sales channels and territories 
number of customers 
we believe our customer count is a key indicator of our market penetration  the productivity of our sales organization and the value that our products bring to our customer base 
we also believe our existing customers represent significant future revenue opportunities for us 
we discuss for the periods presented revenue  gross margin  the components of loss from operations and number of customers further below under segments and results of operations  as applicable  and we discuss our cash and cash equivalents under liquidity and capital resources 
we also believe that deferred revenue and cash flow from operations are key financial metrics for our business 
the components of deferred revenue and cash flow from operations  as well as our rationale for monitoring these metrics  are discussed immediately below this table years ended or as of december  in thousands  except percentages and number of customers net revenue gross margin loss from operations total deferred revenue cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by used in operations number of customers deferred revenue our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue 
the majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unamortized portion of services revenue from maintenance and support contracts 
we monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods 
we also assess the increase in our deferred revenue balance plus revenue we recognized in a particular period as a measure of our sales activity for that period 
while the change in our deferred revenue and revenue recognized in a given period comprise the majority of our sales activity during that period  they do not constitute the entire sales activity during the period 
our total sales activity also includes sales of products and services for which we have not yet met the criteria to recognize revenue or add such amounts to our deferred revenue balance 
revenue and deferred revenue from these transactions is recognized or recorded in future periods when we have met the required criteria 
we discuss for the periods presented deferred revenue further below under results of operations 

table of contents net cash used in operations we monitor cash flow from operations as a measure of our overall business performance 
our cash flow from operations is driven primarily by sales of our products and licenses and  to a lesser extent  from up front payments from customers under maintenance and support contracts 
our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  costs of acquiring the hardware used for our appliances  marketing and promotional expenses and costs related to our facilities 
monitoring cash flow from operations enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non cash effects of certain items such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expenses  thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business 
segments for financial reporting purposes  we operate as two reportable business segments i imperva  which is comprised of our financial position and results of operations and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries  and ii incapsula  which is comprised entirely of the financial position and results of operations of our majority owned subsidiary

our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments have increased from million as of december  to million as of december  this increase is primarily the result of our initial public offering of common stock in november in which we raised million  after deducting underwriters discounts and offering expenses 
this amount was partially offset by our losses from operations as we continued to fund our investments in growth  including the development of future products and product enhancements  and expanded into new sales channels and geographies 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors  including  among other things  market acceptance of our products  the cost of our research and development activities  the acquisition of other businesses and overall economic conditions 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under our credit facility agreement with a financial institution 
the credit facility agreement  as amended  provides for borrowing capacity up to million and contains a minimum cash and cash equivalents balance covenant of million 
the credit facility expires on may  as of december   we were compliant with the covenant under the credit facility 

table of contents cash flows the following summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated has been derived from our consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k years ended december  dollars in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash flows from operating activities we have historically experienced negative cash flow from operations as we have continued to expand our business although we did generate million in cash flow from operations during the year ended december  our largest uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures 
our primary source of cash flow from operating activities is cash receipts from customers 
our cash flow from operations will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we grow our revenues and increase our headcount  primarily in our sales and marketing and research and development functions  in order to grow our business 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  reflected a net loss of million  adjusted for non cash charges of million  as well as a net change of million in our net operating assets and liabilities 
the net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a million increase in our deferred revenue  which represents unearned amounts billed to our customers  resulting from our larger installed base combined with strong maintenance and support renewal rates from our existing customers 
this change was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  reflected a net loss of million  partially offset by non cash charges of million  as well as a net change of million in our net operating assets and liabilities 
the net change in our operating assets and liabilities was the result of an increase in accounts receivable of million partially offset by an million increase in our deferred revenue  which represents unearned amounts billed to our customers  resulting from our larger installed base combined with strong maintenance and support renewal rates from our existing customers 
net cash used in operating activities of million for reflected a net loss of million  partially offset by a net change of million in our net operating assets and liabilities and aggregate non cash charges of million 
the net change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of a million increase in our deferred revenue  a million increase in accrued compensation and benefits  a million increase in accrued and other current liabilities  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
non cash charges included million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation 
cash flows from investing activities our investing activities consist primarily of expenditures to purchase property and equipment and purchases and sales of investments 
during the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million  primarily as a result of in net purchases of short term investments in addition to million in net purchases of property and equipment 
during the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million  primarily as a result of million in capital expenditures 
in  cash used in investing activities of million was primarily attributable to million in capital expenditures  a million increase in restricted cash relating to our purchase commitments and million in net purchases of short term investments 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as a result of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  which primarily resulted from the million of net proceeds of our november initial public offering of common stock  after deducting underwriters discounts and offering expenses  issuance of shares of restricted common stock of million  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million and proceeds from the sale of common stock of million 
these amounts were partially offset by net repayments on our revolving credit facility of million 
in  cash provided by financing activities was million  which consisted of million in proceeds from the issuance of restricted stock  million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and million in borrowings on our revolving credit facility  partially offset by million in repayments on the convertible promissory note that incapsula entered into in november with our chief executive officer 
for a description of our issuance of restricted stock and transactions with incapsula  see certain relationships and related person transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and incapsula  our majority owned subsidiary 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods 
management bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  which  in turn  could change the results from those reported 
our management evaluates its estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
the critical accounting policies requiring estimates  assumptions  and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below 
revenue recognition our management must make significant judgments and estimates to determine revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
we derive revenue from two sources i products and license revenue  which includes hardware and perpetual software license revenue and ii services revenue  which includes maintenance  professional services  training and subscription arrangements 
substantially all of product and license sales have been sold in combination with maintenance services 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we define each of the four criteria above as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
evidence of an arrangement consists of a purchase order issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a distributor or value added reseller agreement and  in limited cases  an end user agreement and or purchase order 
delivery or performance has occurred 
we use shipping and related documents  or written evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  to verify delivery or performance 
we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which primarily is upon shipment to value added resellers  distributors or end users 
in most instances  we do not have significant obligations for future performance  such as customer acceptance provisions  rights of return or pricing credits  associated with our sales 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or service is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
the sales price is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
standard payment terms to customers range from to days 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 

table of contents collection is reasonably assured 
we assess probability of collection on a customer by customer basis 
our customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates their financial condition and ability to pay for products and services 
if we conclude that collection is not reasonably assured based upon an initial review  we do not recognize revenue until payment is received 
maintenance and subscription revenue includes arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for our products and subscription services revenue primarily related to our cloud based services 
the terms of our subscription service arrangements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the related software 
maintenance is offered under renewable  fee based contracts  which include technical support  hardware repair and replacement parts  bug fixes  patches and unspecified upgrades on a when and if available basis 
maintenance and subscription revenue is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract  with the related expenses recognized as incurred 
maintenance and subscription contracts usually have a term of one to five years 
unearned maintenance and subscription revenue is included in deferred revenue 
professional service revenue primarily consists of the fees we earn related to installation and consulting services 
we recognize revenue from professional services upon delivery or completion of performance 
professional service arrangements are typically short term in nature and are largely completed within days from the start of service 
training services are recognized upon delivery of the training 
multiple element arrangements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance any tangible products containing software components and non software components that operate together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
in addition  the fasb amended the accounting standards for multiple element revenue arrangements not within the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance to provide updated guidance on whether multiple elements exist  how the elements in an arrangement should be separated  and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate elements  implement a price hierarchy  where the selling price for an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe  if available and vsoe is not available  or the best estimate of selling price besp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
this guidance did not change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions 
our non software products and services qualify as separate units of accounting because they have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and our revenue arrangements do not include a general right of return for delivered products 
most of our products are hardware appliances containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product 
therefore  our hardware appliances are considered non software deliverables and have been removed from the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
our product revenue also includes revenue from the sale of stand alone software products 
stand alone software may operate on our hardware appliance  but is not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware and continues to be subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance  which remains unchanged 
certain of our stand alone software when sold with hardware appliances is considered essential to the functionality and as a result is no longer accounted for under industry specific software revenue recognition guidance  however  this same software when sold separately is accounted for under the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades for our products  on a when and if available basis  through maintenance and support contracts 
to the extent that the software being supported is not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware  these support arrangements would continue to be subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
for stand alone software sales after december  and for all transactions entered into prior to january   we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance 
under the software revenue recognition guidance  we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
in the majority of our contracts  the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is maintenance and support services 
under the residual method  vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue 
if evidence of vsoe of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 

table of contents for all other transactions originating or materially modified after december   we recognize revenue in accordance with the amended accounting guidance 
for certain arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the arrangement fee to the non software element based upon the relative selling price of such element and  if software and software related eg  maintenance and support for the software element elements are also included in the arrangement  we allocate the arrangement fee to each of those software and software related elements as a group 
after such allocations are made  the amount of the arrangement fee allocated to the software and software related elements is accounted for using the residual method 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each element using vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or if not  tpe of selling price  if it exists 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for an element  we use our besp for that element 
the revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for that element 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  or subject to our future performance obligation 
consistent with our methodology under previous accounting guidance  vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range  evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical stand alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range 
in addition  we consider major service groups and geographies in determining vsoe 
we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
when we are unable to establish the selling price of our non software deliverables using vsoe or tpe  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for the purposes of allocating the arrangement by reviewing external and internal market factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices including discounting  the geographies in which we offer our products and services  the type of customer ie  distributor  value added reseller or direct end user and competition 
additionally  we consider historical transactions  including transactions whereby the deliverable was sold on a stand alone basis 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and approval by our management 
selling prices are analyzed on a quarterly basis to identify if we have experienced significant changes in our selling prices 
for our non software deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables 
for our hardware appliances we use besp as the selling price as we have no history of selling our hardware appliances separately 
for our maintenance and support and professional services and training  we primarily use vsoe as the selling price and when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe  we used besp 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation costs related to stock option  employee stock purchase plan  restricted stock unit  or rsu  and shares of restricted stock grants to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant  net of estimated forfeitures 
for stock option and employee stock purchase plan grants  we estimate the grant date fair value  and the resulting stock based compensation expense  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of rsus is determined using the closing price of the company s stock on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value of the stock based awards is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards 
the fair value of the option and employee stock purchase plan awards during  and were calculated using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions years ended december  option grants expected dividend rate risk free interest rate expected term in years expected volatility espp grants dividend rate risk free interest rate expected term in years expected volatility 
table of contents the black scholes options pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share based awards  including the grant s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
these assumptions include expected term 
the expected term represents the period over which the stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
for option grants that are considered to be plain vanilla  we used the simplified method to determine the expected term as set forth in the guidance provided by the us securities and exchange commission 
the simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time to vesting and the contractual life of the options 
for option grants that are not considered plain vanilla  the expected term is based on historical option exercise behavior and post vesting cancellations of options by employees 
for espp grants  the expected term is based on the length of the offering period  which is six months 
risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon us treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to each award s expected term 
expected volatility 
since we do not have a sufficient trading history of our common stock  the expected volatility was derived from the average historic volatilities of several unrelated public companies within our industry that we considered to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants and the offering period for espp grants 
expected dividend 
the expected dividend was assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to do so 
in addition to assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model  we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock based compensation for expense related to our awards 
our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures 
we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience  analysis of employee turnover and other factors 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the financial statements 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term  expected volatility and forfeiture rate related to our own stock based compensation on a prospective basis 
as we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock  we may have refinements to the estimates of our expected volatility  expected terms and forfeiture rates  which could materially impact our future stock based compensation expense 
long lived assets property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation on our consolidated balance sheets 
depreciation on property and equipment is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we make estimates of the useful life of our property and equipment in order to determine depreciation expense to be recorded each reporting period based on similar assets purchased in the past and our historical experience with such similar assets  or asset group  as well as anticipated technological or market changes 
the estimated useful life of our property and equipment directly impacts the timing of when our depreciation expense is recognized 
there is significant judgment involved with estimating the useful lives of our property and equipment  and a change in the estimates of such useful lives could cause our depreciation expense in future periods to increase significantly 
we assess impairment of our property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset is impaired or the estimated useful lives are no longer appropriate 
circumstances such as changes in technology or in the way an asset is being used may trigger an impairment review 
if indicators of impairment exist and the undiscounted projected cash flow associated with such assets are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recorded to write the asset down to their estimated fair values 
fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flow 
we have not recognized an impairment charge on our property and equipment in our consolidated statement of operations during  and income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the subsequent period when such a change in estimate occurs 
we use the liability method for accounting of deferred income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the 
table of contents determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized 
to the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets 
in the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we subsequently realize deferred income tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize and measure potential liabilities based upon a more likely than not criteria 
based upon these criteria  we estimate whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed  a further charge to expense would result 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that could be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves for uncertain tax positions are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves for uncertain tax positions and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties  if applicable 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations and thereafter total operating lease obligations severance pay fund purchase commitments total operating lease agreements represent our obligations to make payments under our non cancelable lease agreements for our facilities 
during the year ended december   we made regular lease payments of million under the operating lease agreements 
our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million of non current liabilities for our israeli severance pay fund 
the specific timing of any cash payments relating to this obligation cannot be projected with reasonable certainty and  therefore  no amounts for this obligation are included in the annual columns of the table set forth above 
purchase commitments are contractual obligations to purchase hardware appliances and related component parts from our vendors in advance of anticipated sales 
off balance sheet arrangements through december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our outstanding debt obligations 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investment accounts as of december  and totaled million and million  respectively  and consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments with maturities of less than one year from the date of purchase 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the united states 
however  because of the short term nature of the instruments in our portfolio  a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or our results of operation 
as of december   we have no amounts outstanding under our credit facility agreement 
to the extent in the future we enter into other long term debt arrangements  we would be subject to fluctuations in interest rates which could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operation 
foreign currency exchange risk our consolidated results of operations and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
substantially all of our revenue is generated in us dollars 
our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located  which is primarily in the us and israel and to a lesser extent in emea and asia pacific 
our consolidated results of operations and cash flow are  therefore  subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the effect of a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchanges rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements 
to date  we have used derivative financial instruments  specifically foreign currency forward contracts  to manage exposure to foreign currency risks  by hedging a portion of our forecasted expenses denominated in israeli shekels expected to occur within a year 
the effect of exchange rate changes on foreign currency forward contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged item 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes
