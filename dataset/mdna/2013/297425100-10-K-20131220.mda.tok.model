during fiscal  sales declined to billion 
gross margin increased to 
research  development and engineering decreased million across all segments to of sales 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million to of sales  mainly due to the million charge for the ddtc matter 
we are subject to us export laws and regulations  including the international traffic in arms regulations itar  that generally restrict the export of defense products  technical data  and defense services 
we have filed voluntary disclosure reports concerning certain technical and administrative violations of the itar with the us department of state s directorate of defense trade controls ddtc office of defense trade controls compliance ddtc office of compliance 
to address these problems  we have made a number of investments in our export compliance functions  including additional staffing  ongoing implementation of a new software system  employee training  and establishment of a regular compliance audit program and corrective action process 
the ddtc office of compliance acknowledged our progress and continuing improvements  but nevertheless informed us that it intends to impose civil monetary fines and administrative sanctions based on the information it had concerning our earlier history in handling itar controlled transactions  including the substance of our prior voluntary disclosures and other aspects of itar compliance errors 
management has been in discussions with the agency and provided supplemental information with the intent of reaching a settlement 
on august   the ddtc office of compliance proposed a total penalty of million  with million suspended and eligible for offset credit based on verified expenditures for past and future remedial compliance measures 
based on this proposal  we estimated and recorded a million charge in fiscal we have continued discussions with the ddtc office of compliance on final settlement terms  and the final settlement is subject to approval by the agency 
while we cannot be certain of the outcome  management believes that the final resolution of this matter will not be materially different from our estimated accrual 
management believes that the additional expense associated with improving our compliance program will increase compliance cost about million in fiscal compared to the prior year period

in april  we amended the secured credit facility to provide for million term loan us term loan 
the interest rate on the us term loan ranges from libor plus to libor plus  depending on the leverage ratios at the time the funds are drawn 
at october   we had million outstanding under the us term loan at an interest rate of libor plus  which is currently 
the loan amortizes at of the original principal balance quarterly through march  with the remaining balance due in july in july  we amended the secured credit facility to provide for a new million term loan euro term loan 
the interest rate on the euro term loan ranges from euro libor plus to euro libor plus  depending on the leverage ratios at the time the funds are drawn 
at october   we had million outstanding or million under the euro term loan at an interest rate of euro libor plus  which is currently 
the loan amortizes at of the original principal balance quarterly through march  with the remaining balance due in july in march  we entered into a secured credit facility for million made available through a group of banks 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and interest is based on standard inter bank offering rates 
the credit facility expires in july the interest rate ranges from libor plus to libor plus  depending on the leverage ratios at the time the funds are drawn 
at october   we had million outstanding under the secured credit facility at an interest rate of libor plus  which is currently 
an additional million of unsecured foreign currency credit facilities have been extended by foreign banks for a total of million available companywide 
available credit under the above credit facilities was million at fiscal year end  when reduced by outstanding borrowings of million and letters of credit of million 
on august   we issued million of notes requiring semi annual interest payments in march and september of each year until maturity 
the net proceeds from the sale of the notes  after deducting million of debt issuance cost  were million 
the notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the company 
the notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally on a senior basis  by all the existing and future domestic subsidiaries of the company unless designated as an unrestricted subsidiary  and those foreign subsidiaries that executed related subsidiary guarantees under the indenture covering the notes 
the notes are subject to redemption at the option of the company at any time prior to august   at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued interest to the date of redemption and a make whole provision 
the notes are also subject to redemption at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after august   at redemption prices starting at of the principal amount plus accrued interest during the period beginning august   and declining annually to of principal and accrued interest on or after august  in april  we redeemed the million senior notes due march notes 
in connection with the redemption  we wrote off million in unamortized debt issuance costs as a charge against interest expense 
in addition  we incurred a million redemption premium and received proceeds of million from the termination of its million interest rate swap agreements 
as a result  the redemption of the notes resulted in a net loss of million on extinguishment of debt 
we believe cash on hand  funds generated from operations and other available debt facilities are sufficient to fund operating cash requirements and capital expenditures through fiscal we believe we will have adequate access to capital markets to fund future acquisitions 
permanent investment of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries our non us subsidiaries have million in cash and cash equivalents at october  cash and cash equivalents at our us parent and subsidiaries aggregated million at october   and cash flow from these operations is sufficient to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt repayments of our domestic operations 
we have available credit to our us parent and subsidiaries of million on our us secured credit facility 
the earnings of our non us subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely invested  and accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes has been made on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability for temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries is not practical to determine because of the complexities regarding the calculation of unremitted earnings and the potential for tax credits 
government refundable advances government refundable advances consist of payments received from the canadian government to assist in the research and development related to commercial aviation 
these advances totaled million and million at october   and october   respectively 
the repayment of the advances is based on year over year commercial aviation revenue growth at cmc beginning in imputed interest on the advances was at october  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations our pension plans principally include a us pension plan maintained by esterline and non us plans maintained by cmc 
our principal post retirement plans include non us plans maintained by cmc  which are non contributory health care and life insurance plans 
we account for pension expense using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date  and we make actuarially computed contributions to our pension plans as necessary to adequately fund benefits 
our funding policy is consistent with the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
in fiscal and  operating cash flow included million and million  respectively  of cash funding to these pension plans 
we expect pension funding requirements for the plans maintained by esterline and cmc to be approximately million and million  respectively  in fiscal the rate of increase in future compensation levels is consistent with our historical experience and salary administration policies 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on long term target asset allocations of equity and fixed income 
we periodically review allocations of plan assets by investment type and evaluate external sources of information regarding long term historical returns and expected future returns for each investment type  and accordingly  believe a to assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is appropriate for both the esterline and cmc plans 
current allocations are consistent with the long term targets 
we made the following assumptions with respect to our esterline pension obligation in fiscal and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate rate of increase in future compensation levels assumed long term rate of return on plan assets we made the following assumptions with respect to our cmc pension obligation in fiscal and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate rate of increase in future compensation levels assumed long term rate of return on plan assets we use a discount rate for expected returns that is a spot rate developed from a yield curve established from high quality corporate bonds and matched to plan specific projected benefit payments 
although future changes to the discount rate are unknown  had the discount rate increased or decreased by basis points in fiscal  pension liabilities in total would have decreased million or increased million  respectively 
if all other assumptions are held constant  the estimated effect on fiscal pension expense from a hypothetical basis points increase or decrease in both the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material effect on our pension expense 
we made the following assumptions with respect to our esterline post retirement obligation in fiscal and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate initial weighted average health care trend rate ultimate weighted average health care trend rate we made the following assumptions with respect to our cmc post retirement obligation in fiscal and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate initial weighted average health care trend rate ultimate weighted average health care trend rate the assumed health care trend rate has a significant impact on our post retirement benefit obligations 
our health care trend rate was based on the experience of our plan and expectations for the future 
a basis points increase in the health care trend rate would increase our post retirement benefit obligation by million at october  a basis points decrease in the health care trend rate would decrease our post retirement benefit obligation by million at october  assuming all other assumptions are held constant  the estimated effect on fiscal post retirement benefit expense from a hypothetical basis points increase or decrease in the health care trend rate would not have a material effect on our post retirement benefit expense 
research and development expense for the three years ended october   research and development expense has averaged of sales 
we estimate that research and development expense in fiscal will be about of sales for the full year 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of fiscal year end 
liabilities for income taxes were excluded from the table  as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments 
in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt interest obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations includes million representing interest on capital lease obligations 
seasonality the timing of our revenues is impacted by the purchasing patterns of our customers and  as a result  we do not generate revenues evenly throughout the year 
moreover  our first fiscal quarter  november through january  includes significant holiday vacation periods in both europe and north america 
this leads to decreased order and shipment activity  consequently  first quarter results are typically weaker than other quarters and not necessarily indicative of our performance in subsequent quarters

currency risks we own significant operations in canada  france and the united kingdom 
to the extent that sales are transacted in a foreign currency  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
furthermore  we have assets denominated in foreign currencies that are not offset by liabilities in such foreign currencies 
at october   we had the following monetary assets subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk us dollar denominated backlog with customers whose functional currency is other than the us dollar  us dollar denominated accounts receivable and payable  and certain forward contracts  which are not accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
the foreign exchange rate for the dollar relative to the euro decreased to at october   from at october   the dollar relative to the uk pound decreased to from  and the dollar relative to the canadian dollar increased to from 
foreign currency transactions affecting monetary assets and forward contracts resulted in a million loss in fiscal  a million loss in fiscal  and a million gain in fiscal the million gain in fiscal included a million gain due to our holding euros to fund the souriau acquisition 
our policy is to hedge a portion of our forecasted transactions using forward exchange contracts with maturities up to months 
the company does not enter into any forward contracts for trading purposes 
at october   and october   the notional value of foreign currency forward contracts was million and million  respectively 
the net fair value of these contracts was a million asset and a million asset at october   and october   respectively 
if the us dollar increased by a hypothetical  the effect on the fair value of the foreign currency contracts would be an increase of million 
if the us dollar decreased by a hypothetical  the effect on the fair value of the foreign currency contracts would be a decrease of million

contract rate total fair value at the company has no derivative contracts maturing after fiscal critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  accounting for inventories  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  accounting for legal contingencies  accounting for pension benefits  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is determinable  and the collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize product revenues at the point of shipment or delivery in accordance with the terms of sale 
sales are net of returns and allowances 
returns and allowances are not significant because products are manufactured to customer specification and are covered by the terms of the product warranty 
revenues and profits on fixed price contracts with significant engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the achievement of contractual milestones and the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to total estimated costs for each contract cost to cost method 
we review cost performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing contracts at least quarterly 
the impact of revisions of profit estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period they become evident 
when change orders have been approved by both the company and the customer for both scope and price and realization is deemed probable  the original contract price is adjusted and revenues are recognized on contract performance as determined by the achievement of contractual milestones and the cost to cost method 
for partially approved change orders  costs attributable to unpriced change orders are treated as costs of the contract performance in the period the costs are incurred 
claims are also recognized as contract revenue when approved by both the company and the customer  based on contract performance 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses expected to be incurred on accounts receivable balances 
judgment is required in estimation of the allowance and is based upon specific identification  collection history and creditworthiness of the debtor 
inventories we account for inventories on a first in  first out or average cost method of accounting at the lower of its cost or market 
the determination of market requires judgment in estimating future demand  selling prices and cost of disposal 
judgment is required when determining inventory cost adjustments 
inventory cost adjustments are recorded when inventory is considered to be excess or obsolete based upon an analysis of actual on hand quantities on a part level basis to forecasted product demand and historical usage 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  including a significant sustained decline in an entity s market value  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business  or other factors 
goodwill is tested for impairment in a two step process 
the first step step one of the goodwill impairment test involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 
fair value fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or incurred or sold or settled in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced liquidation sale 
a reporting unit is generally defined at the operating segment level or at the component level one level below the operating segment  if said component constitutes a business 
the fair value of a reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value  which is defined as the book basis of total assets less total liabilities 
in the event a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  evidence of potential impairment exists 
in such a case  the second step step two of the impairment test is required  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  with the excess of fair value over allocated net assets representing the fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill 
as we have grown through acquisitions  we have accumulated billion of goodwill and million of indefinite lived intangible assets out of total assets of billion at october  the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
during the third fiscal quarter of  management performed a step one impairment test for racal acoustics  inc racal acoustics upon identification of an indicator of impairment 
the company s third quarter forecast in projected a higher operating loss in fiscal and lower earnings over the five years compared to the prior year forecast due to further delays and reductions in global defense programs 
as required under us gaap  a step two impairment test was required in fiscal  because the current fair value of the business using a discounted cash flow and market approach was less than its carrying amount of the business 
under step two  the fair value of all racal acoustics assets and liabilities were estimated  including tangible assets  existing technology  and trade names  for the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment 
assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates  royalty rates  and obsolescence rates used in valuing the intangible assets and pricing of comparable transactions in the market in valuing the tangible assets 
the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill resulted in an impairment charge of million in fiscal an impairment charge of million was recorded at racal acoustics in fiscal we performed our annual impairment review for fiscal as of july   and our step one analysis indicates that no impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived assets exists at any of our other reporting units 
our souriau reporting unit s margin in passing the step one analysis was about  mainly reflecting lower market valuation assumptions in management expects that continued improvements in operations will result in favorable actual results compared to our original plan 
it is possible  however  that as a result of events or circumstances  we could conclude at a later date that goodwill of million at souriau may be considered impaired 
we also may be required to record an earnings charge or incur unanticipated expenses if  due to a change in strategy or other reasons  we determined the value of other assets has been impaired 
these other assets include trade names of million and intangible assets of million 
the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and estimated product life cycles 
in making these judgments  we evaluate the financial health of the business  including such factors as industry performance  changes in technology and operating cash flows 
we used available market data and a discounted cash flow analysis in completing our annual impairment test 
we believe that our cash flow estimates are reasonable based upon the historical cash flows and future operating and strategic plans of our reporting units 
in addition to cash flow estimates  our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions 
except for souriau  the fair value of all our reporting units exceeds its book value by greater than 
a change in the discount rate used in the cash flow analysis would result in a change in the fair value of our other reporting units of approximately million 
a change in the growth rate assumed in the calculation of the terminal value of cash flows would result in a change in the fair value of our other reporting units by million 
none of these changes would have resulted in any of our other reporting units to be impaired 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets that are to be disposed of are required to be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
an asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the first step step one of an impairment test of long lived assets is to determine the amount of future undiscounted cash flow of the long lived asset 
in the event the undiscounted future cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the long lived asset  a second step is required step two  and the long lived asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value 
fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
as we have grown through acquisitions  we have accumulated million of definite lived intangible assets 
the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
contingencies we are party to various lawsuits and claims  both as plaintiff and defendant  and have contingent liabilities arising from the conduct of business 
we are covered by insurance for general liability  product liability  workers compensation and certain environmental exposures  subject to certain deductible limits 
we are self insured for amounts less than our deductible and where no insurance is available 
an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
pension and other post retirement benefits we account for pension expense using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date 
we select appropriate assumptions including discount rate  rate of increase in future compensation levels and assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and expected annual increases in costs of medical and other health care benefits in regard to our post retirement benefit obligations 
our assumptions are based upon historical results  the current economic environment and reasonable expectations of future events 
actual results which vary from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and accordingly  are recognized in expense in these periods 
significant differences between our assumptions and actual experience or significant changes in assumptions could impact the pension costs and the pension obligation 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position and results of operations
