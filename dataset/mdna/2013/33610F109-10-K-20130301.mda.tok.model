item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
these restrictions  particularly if we are at or near the required ratios or thresholds  could prevent or inhibit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pursue some business initiatives or effect certain transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our company  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  our continued ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to compliance with these financial and operating covenants and our failure to comply with such covenants could cause a default under the credit facility 
although we were in compliance with all of the financial and operating covenants of our outstanding debt agreements as of december   certain of the covenants become more restrictive over time  and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with these covenants in future periods 
our debt agreements also contain cross default provisions that would be triggered if we are in default under other loans in in excess of certain amounts 
in the event of a default  the lenders could accelerate the timing of payments under the debt obligations and we may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources  which may not be available to us on attractive terms  or at all  which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition  results of operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
we may incur additional costs in connection with the implementation of remedial actions and enhancement measures that were adopted in response to the internal investigation completed in july  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
as previously disclosed  management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  relating to our monitoring and oversight of compliance with financial covenants under our debt agreements  as more fully described in item a 
controls and procedures 
in response to this material weakness determination  as well as the findings of the subsequent internal investigation completed in july the internal investigation and recommendations of the audit committee of the company s board of trustees  the company s board of trustees adopted a number of measures designed to remediate the underlying causes of the material weakness  as well as certain other enhancement measures unrelated to the material weakness 
these remedial actions and enhancement measures include enhancements to debt covenant compliance controls  enhancements to financial reporting controls  enhancement of the role of the company s legal and accounting functions and general control enhancements regarding  among other things  enterprise risk management and communication by management with the audit committee and outside legal counsel 
our management  board of trustees and employees already have expended a substantial amount of time in connection with matters related to the internal investigation  diverting a significant amount of resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy 
although we have remediated this material weakness as of december   we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with the continued implementation of these remedial actions and enhancement measures  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
for more information regarding these remedial actions and enhancement measures  see item a 
controls and procedures remediation of material weakness 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity and financial condition and the market price of our securities 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
as previously disclosed  management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  relating to our monitoring and oversight of compliance with financial covenants under our debt agreements  as more fully described in item a 
controls and procedures 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

table of contents although we have remediated this material weakness as of december   we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will not be subject to additional material weaknesses in the future 
any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could prevent us from accurately reporting our results of operations  result in material misstatements in our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
this could prevent or inhibit our ability to access third party sources of capital  which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  thereby adversely affecting the perception of our business and the market price of our securities 
we have been informed that the sec has initiated an informal inquiry relating to the matters that were the subject of the company s internal investigation regarding the material weakness previously identified in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december   which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we have been informed that the sec has initiated an informal inquiry relating to the matters that were the subject of the company s internal investigation regarding the material weakness previously identified in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  we have been  and intend to continue  voluntarily cooperating fully with the sec 
we cannot reasonably estimate the timing  scope or outcome of this informal inquiry and are unable to predict whether a formal investigation will be initiated or what consequences any further investigation may have on us 
the informal inquiry  or any formal investigation that may be initiated  may result in the incurrence of significant legal expense  both directly and as the result of our indemnification obligations to our trustees and current and former employees 
in addition  the informal inquiry  or any formal investigation that may be initiated  may divert management s attention from our ordinary business operations and may limit our ability to obtain financing to fund our on going operating requirements 
adverse findings by the sec or the incurrence of costs  fees  fines or penalties that are not reimbursed by insurance policies  in connection with or as a result of this informal inquiry or any formal investigation that may be initiated  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we compete with other parties for tenants and property acquisitions 
our long term business strategy contemplates expansion through acquisitions 
the commercial real estate industry is highly competitive  and we compete with substantially larger companies  including substantially larger reits and institutional investment funds  which may have better access to lower cost capital for the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
as a result  we may not be able or have the opportunity to make suitable investments on favorable terms in the future  which may impede our growth and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  competition for acquisitions may significantly increase the purchase price and or require us to  among other things  make concessions to sellers and or agree to higher non refundable deposits  which could require us to agree to acquisition terms less favorable to us 
we also face significant competition for tenants in our properties from owners and operators of business park  office and industrial properties that may be more willing to make space available to prospective tenants at lower prices and with greater tenant improvements and other concessions than comparable spaces in our properties  especially in difficult economic times 
thus  competition could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and may reduce the rents we are able to charge and increase the tenant improvements and other concessions that we offer  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we may be unable to renew expiring leases or re lease vacant space on a timely basis or on attractive terms  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
approximately  and of our annualized cash basis rent is scheduled to expire in  and  respectively  excluding month to month leases 
current tenants may not renew their leases upon the expiration of their terms and may attempt to terminate their leases prior to the expiration of their current terms 
for example  as discussed in the risk factor above  our leases with the us government include favorable tenant termination provisions 
if non renewals or terminations occur  we may not be able to locate qualified replacement tenants and  as a result  we could lose a significant source of revenue while remaining responsible for the payment of our financial obligations 
moreover  the terms of a renewal or new lease  including the amount of rent  may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms  or we may be forced to provide tenant improvements at our expense or provide other concessions or additional services to maintain or attract tenants 
any of these factors could cause a decline in lease revenue or an increase in operating expenses  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 

table of contents if we are not successful in finding an additional capital partner for the redevelopment of first street  ne  we will be carrying a significant investment in a non income producing property  which could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow 
the greyhound lease at first street  ne is scheduled to terminate in august although we are exploring options related to this site  including bringing in an additional capital partner  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in finding an additional capital partner for the redevelopment project 
if we are unable to find an additional capital partner for the project  we will own a sizable non income producing property once the greyhound lease terminates and will be required to cover interest payments on the debt secured by the property and other costs related to owning the property from other sources  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow 
our unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan may limit our ability to raise additional capital through mortgage loans and expose us to the possibility of foreclosure  which could result in the loss of our investment in a property or group of properties 
our unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan were amended in may to provide the lenders with the right  in their sole discretion  to record mortgages on substantially all of our unencumbered properties  which may limit our ability to raise additional capital through loans secured by mortgages on those properties 
as a result  we may be forced to raise capital through other sources that may not be available on attractive terms  or at all  which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition  results of operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
moreover  incurring mortgage and other secured debt obligations increases our risk of property losses because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and ultimately our loss of the property securing any loans for which we are in default 
any foreclosure on a mortgaged property or group of properties could adversely affect the overall value of the property or portfolio of properties 
for tax purposes  a foreclosure on any of our properties that are subject to a nonrecourse mortgage loan would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage 
if the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property  we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure  but would not receive any cash proceeds  which could hinder our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements imposed by the internal revenue code 
if recent adverse global market and economic conditions worsen or do not fully recover  our business  results of operations  cash flow and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
overall financial market and economic conditions have been challenging in recent years  beginning with the credit crisis and recession that began in challenging economic conditions persisted throughout  including a continuing european sovereign debt crisis  volatility in the debt and equity markets and uncertainty surrounding us federal budget negotiations 
these conditions  which could continue or worsen  combined with high unemployment and residential and commercial real estate markets that have been slow to recover  among other things  have contributed to ongoing market volatility and uncertain expectations for the us and other economies 
we cannot predict whether these conditions will persist or deteriorate further 
if these conditions worsen or do not fully recover  they may limit our ability  and the ability of our tenants  to replace or renew maturing liabilities on a timely basis  access the capital markets to meet liquidity and capital expenditure requirements and may result in material adverse effects on our and our tenants financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  if our tenants businesses or ability to obtain financing deteriorates further  they may be unable to pay rent to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow 
acquisitions and developments initially may be dilutive and or may not produce the returns that we expect  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 
our long term business strategy contemplates expansion through acquisitions and developments  which initially may be dilutive to our net income 
in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property  we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property 
in particular  we estimate the return on our investment based on expected occupancy and rental rates  as well as expected development costs and leasing costs 
we have acquired  and in the future may acquire  properties not fully leased  and the cash flow from existing operations of such properties may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such properties until they are more fully leased at favorable rental rates 
moreover  operating expenses related to acquired properties may be greater than anticipated  particularly if we provide tenant improvements or other concessions or additional services in order to maintain or attract new tenants 
we also may experience unanticipated costs or difficulties integrating newly acquired properties into our existing portfolio or hiring and retaining sufficient operational staff to manage such properties 
if our estimated return on investment for the property proves to be inaccurate and the property is unable to achieve the expected occupancy and rental rates  it may fail to perform as we projected in originally analyzing the investment including  without limitation  as a result of tenant bankruptcies  increased tenant improvements and other concessions  our inability to collect rents and higher than anticipated operating costs  thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
this risk may be particularly pronounced for properties placed into development or acquired shortly before the recent economic downturn  where we estimated occupancy and rental rates without the benefit of knowing how those assumptions might be impacted by the changing economic conditions that followed 
redland corporate center ii  which was vacant at the time of acquisition in the fourth quarter of  was occupied and leased at december  three flint hill  which was also acquired in and placed in service during the fourth quarter of  was occupied and leased at december  atlantic corporate park  was occupied and leased compared to vacant and leased at time of acquisition in ashburn center  was leased and occupied at december   compared to leased and occupied at time of acquisition in 
table of contents in addition  when we acquire certain properties that are significantly under leased  we often plan to reposition or redevelop them with the goal of increasing profitability 
our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping such properties may prove to be inaccurate  which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals 
moreover  we may be unsuccessful in leasing up such properties after repositioning or redeveloping them and if one or more of these new properties do not perform as expected  our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
acquired properties may expose us to unknown liabilities 
we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities 
as a result  if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties  we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it  which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include liabilities for clean up of undisclosed or undiscovered environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business  and claims for indemnification by general partners  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
we are subject to the credit risk of our tenants  which may declare bankruptcy or otherwise fail to make lease payments  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
we are subject to the credit risk of our tenants 
we cannot assure you that our tenants will not default on their leases and fail to make rental payments to us 
in particular  disruptions in the financial and credit markets  local economic conditions and other factors affecting the industries in which our tenants operate may affect our tenants ability to obtain financing to operate their businesses or continue to profitability execute their business plans 
this  in turn  may cause our tenants to be unable to meet their financial obligations  including making rental payments to us  which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency 
a tenant in bankruptcy may be able to restrict our ability to collect unpaid rent and interest during the bankruptcy proceeding and may reject the lease 
in the event of the tenant s breach of its obligations to us or its rejection of the lease in bankruptcy proceedings  we may be unable to locate a replacement tenant in a timely manner or on comparable or better terms 
the loss of rental revenues from any of our larger tenants  a number of our smaller tenants or any combination thereof  combined with our inability to replace such tenants on a timely basis  may materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
a majority of our tenants hold leases covering less than  square feet 
many of these tenants are small companies with nominal net worth and  therefore  may be challenged in operating their businesses during economic downturns 
in addition  certain of our properties are  and may be in the future be  substantially leased to a single tenant and  therefore  such property s operating performance and our ability to service the property s debt is particularly exposed to the economic condition of the tenant 
the loss of rental revenues from any of our larger tenants or a number of our smaller tenants may materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
our variable rate debt subjects us to interest rate risk 
as of december   we had an unsecured revolving credit facility  a million unsecured term loan  and a million secured term loan and certain other debt  some of which is unhedged  that bears interest at a variable rate 
in addition  in february  we entered into a million secured term loan  which bears interest at a variable rate  and we may incur additional variable rate debt in the future 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt  of which  million was hedged through twelve interest rate swap agreements 
our million of variable rate debt does not include our million mortgage loan that encumbers first street  ne  which bears interest at a rate of libor plus  with a floor  because we do not expect libor to increase above before the loan reaches maturity in october libor was at december  increases in interest rates on variable rate debt would increase our interest expense  if not hedged effectively or at all  which would adversely affect net earnings and cash available for payment of our debt obligations and distributions to our security holders 
for example  if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt outstanding as of december  increased by  or basis points  the increase in interest expense on our existing variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flow by approximately million annually 

table of contents we have and may continue to engage in hedging transactions  which can limit our gains and increase exposure to losses 
we have and may continue to enter into hedging transactions to attempt to protect us from the effects of interest rate fluctuations on floating rate debt  or in some cases  prior to a proposed debt issuance 
our hedging transactions may include interest rate swap agreements or interest rate cap or floor agreements  or other interest rate exchange contracts 
hedging activities may not have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
no hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates 
moreover  interest rate hedging could fail to protect us and could adversely affect us because  among other things available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which we seek protection  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability  the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay  the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction  and the value of derivatives used for hedging may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value 
such downward adjustments  or mark to market losses  would reduce our equity 
hedging involves risk and typically involves costs  including transaction costs that may reduce our overall returns on our investments 
these costs increase as the period covered by the hedging increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates 
these costs will also limit the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders 
we generally intend to hedge as much of the interest rate risk as management determines is in our best interests given the cost of such hedging transactions 
reit qualification rules may limit our ability to enter into hedging transactions by  among other things  requiring us to limit our income from hedges 
if we are unable to hedge effectively because of the reit rules  we will face greater interest rate exposure 
development and construction risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 
our renovation  redevelopment  development and related construction activities may subject us to the following risks we may be unable to obtain  or suffer delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects  we may incur construction costs for a property that exceed our original estimates due to increased costs for materials or labor or other costs that we did not anticipate  we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all  especially with respect to large scale developments and redevelopments  which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities  and we may be unable to complete construction and lease up of a property on schedule  which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs 
additionally  the time frame required for development  construction and lease up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for a significant cash return 
because we are required to make cash distributions to our shareholders  if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient  we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions 
any of these conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects 

table of contents failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth and or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may make selected acquisitions outside our current geographic market from time to time as appropriate opportunities arise 
our historical experience is in the greater washington dc region  and we may not be able to operate successfully in other market areas where we have limited or no experience 
we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets 
these risks include  among others a lack of market knowledge and understanding of the local economies  an inability to identify promising acquisition or development opportunities  an inability to identify and cultivate relationships that  similar to our relationships in the greater washington dc region  are important to successfully effecting our business plan  an inability to employ construction trades people  and a lack of familiarity with local government and permitting procedures 
any of these factors could adversely affect the profitability of projects outside our current markets and limit the success of our acquisition and development strategy 
if our acquisition and development strategy is negatively affected  our growth may be impeded and our results of operations materially adversely affected 
our mezzanine loan investments are subject to significant risks  and losses related to these investments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
in and  we structured separate investments in two washington  dc office properties in the form of loans to the owners of the property a million loan that bears interest at a rate of per annum  is interest only and matures on april   and a million loan that bears interest at a rate of per annum  is interest only and matures on may  each loan is secured by a portion of the owners interest in the respective property and is effectively subordinate to a senior mortgage loan on the property 
we may engage in additional lending activities in the future  including mezzanine financing activities 
these types of loans involve a higher degree of risk than long term senior mortgage lending secured by income producing real property  because the loan may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender 
in addition  mezzanine loans may have higher loan to value ratios than conventional mortgage loans  resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 
if a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan  or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy  our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid in full 
where debt senior to our loan exists  the presence of intercreditor arrangements between the holder of the mortgage loan and us  as the mezzanine lender  may limit our ability to amend our loan documents  assign our loans  accept prepayments  exercise our remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers 
as a result  we may not recover some or all of our investment  which could result in losses 
in addition  even if we are able to foreclose on the underlying collateral following a default on a mezzanine loan  we would be substituted for the defaulting borrower and  to the extent income generated on the underlying property is insufficient to meet outstanding debt obligations on the property  may need to commit substantial additional capital to stabilize the property and prevent additional defaults to lenders with existing liens on the property 
significant losses related to mezzanine loans could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders 
under some of our leases  tenants have the right to terminate prior to the scheduled expiration of the lease  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
some leases at our properties provide tenants with the right to terminate prior to the scheduled expiration of the lease 
if a tenant terminates its lease with us prior to the expiration of the term  we may be unable to re lease that space on as favorable terms  or at all  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
property owned through joint ventures  or in limited liability companies and partnerships in which we are not the sole equity holder  may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interests 
we have  and may in the future  make investments through partnerships  limited liability companies or joint ventures  some of which may be significant in size 
in particular  during and  we entered a number of joint ventures in connection with our acquisition and development of various real estate assets 
partnership  limited liability company or joint venture investments may involve various risks  including the following 
table of contents our partners or co members might become bankrupt in which event we and any other remaining general partners or co members would generally remain liable for the liabilities of the partnership or joint venture  our partners or co members might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  our partners or co members may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions  requests  policies  or objectives  including our current policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a real estate investment trust  and agreements governing joint ventures  limited liability companies and partnerships often contain restrictions on the transfer of a member s or partner s interest or buy sell or other provisions that may result in a purchase or sale of the interest at a disadvantageous time or on disadvantageous terms 
the occurrence of one or more of the events described above could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to make distributions with respect to  and the market price of  our securities 
illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to adverse changes in the performance of such properties may be limited 
the real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control  including those described in the risk factor above under real estate investments are inherently risky  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property including the industrial properties that are currently being marketed for sale for the price or on the terms set by us  or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us 
we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 
moreover  the reit rules governing property sales and agreements that we may enter into with joint venture partners or contributors to our operating partnership not to sell certain properties for a period of time may interfere with our ability to dispose of properties on a timely basis without incurring significant additional costs 
we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold 
we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements 
in acquiring a property  we may agree to lock out provisions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions  such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property 
we may also acquire properties that are subject to mortgage loans that may limit our ability to sell those properties prior to the applicable loan s maturity 
these factors and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
liabilities under environmental laws for contamination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
our operating expenses could be higher than anticipated due to liability created under existing or future federal  state or local environmental laws and regulations for contamination 
an owner or operator of real property can face strict  joint and several liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances  including petroleum based products at  on  under or from the property 
similarly  a former owner or operator of real property can face the same liability for the disposal of hazardous substances that occurred during the time of ownership or operation 
we may face liability regardless of our lack of knowledge of the contamination  the extent of the contamination  the timing of the release of the contamination  or whether or not we caused the contamination 

table of contents environmental liability for contamination may include the following  without limitation investigation and feasibility study costs  remediation costs  litigation costs  oversight costs  monitoring costs  institutional control costs  penalties from state and federal agencies  and third party claims 
moreover  operations on site may be required to be suspended until certain environmental contamination is remediated and or permits are received and environmental laws can impose permanent restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used depending on the extent and nature of the contamination 
this may result in a default of the terms of the lease entered into with our tenants 
environmental laws also may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination 
in addition  the presence of hazardous substances at  on  under or from a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property or borrow using the property as collateral  thus harming our financial condition 
there may be environmental liabilities associated with our properties of which we are unaware 
for example  some of our properties contain  or may have contained in the past  underground tanks for the storage of hazardous substances  petroleum based or waste products  or some of our properties have been used  or may have been used  historically to conduct industrial operations  and any of these circumstances could create a potential for release of hazardous substances 
such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
non compliance with environmental laws at our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
our properties are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws 
non compliance with these environmental laws could subject us or our tenants to liability and changes in these laws could increase the potential costs of compliance or increase liability for noncompliance 
although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from a tenant s activities on the property  we could nonetheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest for environmental liabilities created by our tenants  and we cannot be sure that our tenants would satisfy their indemnification obligations under the applicable sales agreement or lease 
moreover  these environmental liabilities could affect our tenants ability to make rental payments to us 
non compliance with environmental laws at our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
liabilities arising from the presence of hazardous building materials at our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
as the owner or operator of real property  we may also incur liability based on various building conditions 
for example  buildings and other structures on properties that we currently own or operate or those we acquire or operate in the future contain  may contain  or may have contained  asbestos containing material  or acm 
environmental  health and safety laws require that acm be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines or penalties on owners  operators or employers for non compliance with those requirements 
these requirements include special precautions  such as removal  abatement or air monitoring  if acm would be disturbed during maintenance  renovation or demolition of a building  potentially resulting in substantial costs 
in addition  we may be subject to liability for personal injury or property damage sustained as a result of exposure to acm or releases of acm into the environment 
as a result  such liabilities arising from the presence of acm or other hazardous building materials at our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
the company s properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues  which could lead to liability for adverse health effects  property damage or remediation costs and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation  chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources  and other biological contaminants such as pollen  viruses and bacteria 
concern about indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants  including mold  has been increasing as exposure to these airborne contaminants have been alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic or other reactions 
as a result  the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or to increase ventilation 
in addition  the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants  employees of our tenants  and others if property damage or health concerns arise 
the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 

table of contents compliance with the americans with disabilities act and fire  safety and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that materially adversely impact our cash flow 
all of our properties are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act  or the ada 
the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial facilities  but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and non compliance could result in the imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants  or both 
while the tenants to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ada provisions  and typically under our leases are obligated to cover costs associated with compliance  if required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated  or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated  the ability of these tenants to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ada  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to security holders 
in addition  we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations  building codes and other land use regulations  as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties 
we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our security holders 
an uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policies on our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
under the terms and conditions of most of the leases currently in force on our properties  our tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons  air  water  land or property  on or off the premises  due to activities conducted on the properties  except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents 
additionally  tenants are generally required  at the tenant s expense  to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease  liability and full replacement value property damage insurance policies 
however  our largest tenant  the federal government  is not required to maintain property insurance at all 
we have obtained comprehensive liability  casualty  earthquake  flood and rental loss insurance policies on our properties 
all of these policies may  depending on the nature of the loss  involve substantial deductibles and certain exclusions 
in addition  we cannot assure you that our tenants will properly maintain their insurance policies or have the ability to pay the deductibles 
should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above  or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy  we could lose all or part of our capital invested in  and anticipated revenue from  one or more of the properties  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect any market on which our securities trade  the markets in which we operate  our business and our results of operations 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our business and our results of operations 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact the value of our properties through damage  destruction  loss or increased security costs 
in particular  we may be directly exposed in washington  dc  a large metropolitan area that has been  and may be in the future  a target of actual or threatened terrorism attacks 
the terrorism insurance that we obtain may not be sufficient to cover loss for damages to our properties as a result of terrorist attacks 
in addition  certain losses resulting from these types of events are uninsurable and others would not be covered by our current terrorism insurance 
additional terrorism insurance may not be available at a reasonable price or at all 
if the properties in which we invest are unable to obtain sufficient and affordable insurance coverage  the value of those investments could decline  and in the event of an uninsured loss  we could lose all or a portion of an investment 
the united states may enter into armed conflicts in the future 
the consequences of any armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business 
any of these events could result in increased volatility in or damage to the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in a continuation of the current economic uncertainty in the united states or abroad 
adverse economic conditions could affect the ability of our tenants to pay rent  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to make distributions to our security holders  and may adversely affect and or result in volatility in the market price for our securities 

table of contents we face risks associated with our tenants being designated prohibited persons by the office of foreign assets control 
pursuant to executive order and other laws  the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury  or ofac  maintains a list of persons designated as terrorists or who are otherwise blocked or banned  or prohibited persons 
ofac regulations and other laws prohibit conducting business or engaging in transactions with prohibited persons 
certain of our loan and other agreements may require us to comply with these ofac requirements 
if a tenant or other party with whom we contract is placed on the ofac list  we may be required by the ofac requirements to terminate the lease or other agreement 
any such termination could result in a loss of revenue or a damage claim by the other party that the termination was wrongful 
rising energy costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
electricity and natural gas  the most common sources of energy used by commercial buildings  are subject to significant price volatility 
in recent years  energy costs  including energy generated by natural gas and electricity  have fluctuated significantly 
some of our properties may be subject to leases that require our tenants to pay all utility costs while other leases may provide that tenants will reimburse us for utility costs in excess of a base year amount 
it is possible that some or all of our tenants will not fulfill their lease obligations and reimburse us for their share of any significant energy rate increases and that we will not be able to retain or replace our tenants if energy price fluctuations continue 
also  to the extent under a lease we agree to pay for such costs  rising energy prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
risks related to our organization and structure our executive officers have agreements that provide them with benefits in the event of a change in control of the company and certain of our executive officers have agreements that provide them with benefits if their employment is terminated without cause or not renewed  which could prevent or deter a change in control of the company 
we have entered into employment agreements with several of our executive officers  including douglas j 
donatelli  nicholas r 
smith  and james h 
dawson  that provide them with severance benefits if their employment ends under certain circumstances following a change in control of the company  terminated without cause  or if the executive officer resigns for good reason as defined in the employment agreements 
in addition  andrew p 
blocher  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  has an agreement with the company that provides him with severance benefits if he is terminated by the company without cause or if he resigns for good reason within months of a change in control of the company 
these benefits could increase the cost to a potential acquirer of the company and thereby prevent or deter a change in control of the company that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the interests of our security holders 
we may experience conflicts of interest with several of our executive officers relating to their ownership of units of our operating partnership 
several of our executive officers may have conflicting duties because  in their capacities as our executive officers  they have a duty to the company and its shareholders  and in the company s capacity as general partner of our operating partnership  they have a fiduciary duty to the limited partners  and some executive officers are themselves limited partners and own a significant number of units of limited partner interest in our operating partnership 
conflicts may arise when the interests of our shareholders and the limited partners of our operating partnership diverge  particularly in circumstances in which there may be an adverse tax consequence to the limited partners  such as upon the sale of assets or the repayment of indebtedness 
these conflicts of interest could lead to decisions that are not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders 
we depend on key personnel  particularly douglas j 
donatelli  with long standing business relationships  the loss of whom could threaten our ability to operate our business successfully and have other negative implications under certain of our indebtedness 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of our senior management team  including douglas j 
donatelli 
in particular  the extent and nature of the relationships that mr 
donatelli has developed in the real estate community in our markets is critically important to the success of our business 
although we have employment agreements with mr 
donatelli and certain other executive officers  there is no guarantee that mr 
donatelli or our other key executive officers will remain employed with us 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers 
the loss of services of one or more members of our senior management team  particularly mr 
donatelli  would harm our business and prospects 
further  loss of a member of our senior management team could be negatively perceived in the capital markets  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities 

table of contents further  the terms of certain of our debt instruments  including one of our term loans  include a default provision whereby if any one of douglas donatelli or nicholas smith  two of our named executive officers  ceases to maintain his current position or duties at our company for any reason  a default under such debt could be triggered unless  within six months  our board has appointed a qualified substitute individual acceptable to the majority of the lenders in their sole discretion 
one of our trustees may have conflicts of interest with our company 
one of our company s trustees  terry l 
stevens  currently serves as senior vice president and chief financial officer of highwoods properties  inc  a fully integrated  north carolina based reit that owns  leases  manages  develops and constructs office and retail properties 
as a result  conflicts may arise if we and highwoods properties  inc compete in the same markets for properties  tenants  personnel and other services 
our rights and the rights of our security holders to take action against our trustees and officers are limited  which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interests 
maryland law generally provides that a trustee has no liability for actions taken as a trustee  but may not be relieved of any liability to the company or its security holders for actions taken in bad faith  with willful misfeasance  gross negligence or reckless disregard for his or her duties 
our amended and restated declaration of trust authorizes us to indemnify  and to pay or reimburse reasonable expenses to  our trustees and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law 
in addition  our declaration of trust limits the liability of our trustees and officers for money damages  except as otherwise prohibited by maryland law or for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money  property or services  or a final judgment or other final adjudication based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the trustee or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated 
as a result  we and our security holders may have more limited rights against our trustees than might otherwise exist 
our amended and restated bylaws require us to indemnify each trustee or officer who has been successful  on the merits or otherwise  in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made a party by reason of his or her service to us 
in addition  we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our trustees and officers 
our series a preferred shares have  and future issuances of our preferred shares may have  terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
we have million shares of our series a cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares issued and outstanding 
our series a preferred shares have certain conversion and redemption features that could be triggered upon a change of control  which may make it more difficult for or discourage a party from taking over our company 
in addition  our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue up to million preferred shares  issuable in one or more classes or series 
our board of trustees may increase the number of preferred shares authorized by our declaration of trust without shareholder approval 
our board of trustees may also classify or reclassify any unissued preferred shares and establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote  to participate in earnings and to convert into securities of any such preferred shares  which rights may be superior to those of our common shares 
thus  in addition to our series a preferred shares  our board of trustees could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of the common shares might receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price of our common shares 
our ownership limitations may restrict business combination opportunities 
to maintain our qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code  no more than of the value of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest may be owned  directly or under applicable attribution rules  by five or fewer individuals as defined to include certain entities during the last half of each taxable year 
to preserve our reit qualification  our declaration of trust generally prohibits direct or indirect beneficial ownership as defined under the code by any person of i more than of the number or value of our outstanding common shares or ii more than of the value of our outstanding shares of all classes 
generally  shares owned by affiliated owners will be aggregated for purposes of the ownership limitation 
our declaration of trust has created an ownership limitation for the group comprised of louis t 
donatelli  douglas j 
donatelli and certain related persons  which prohibits such group from acquiring direct or indirect ownership as defined under the code of i more than of the number or value of our outstanding common shares or ii more than of the value of all of our outstanding shares of all classes 
in addition  pursuant to the articles supplementary setting forth the terms of our series a preferred shares  no person may own  or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code  more than by value or number of shares  whichever is more restrictive of our series a preferred shares 
unless the applicable ownership limitation is waived by our board of trustees prior to transfer  any transfer of our shares that would violate the ownership limitation will be null and void  and the intended transferee will acquire no rights in such shares 
shares that would otherwise be held in violation of the ownership limit will be designated as shares in trust and transferred automatically to a trust effective on the day before the purported transfer or other event giving rise to such excess ownership 
the beneficiary of the trust will be one or more charitable organizations named by us 
the ownership limitation could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control or other transaction in which holders of shares might receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price or that such holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests 
the ownership limitation provisions also may make our common shares an unsuitable investment vehicle for any person seeking to obtain  either alone or with others as a group  ownership of shares that would violate the ownership limitation provisions 

table of contents our board of trustees may change our investment and operational policies and practices without a vote of our security holders  which limits your control of our policies and practices 
our major policies  including our policies and practices with respect to investments  financing  growth  debt capitalization  reit qualification and distributions  are determined by our board of trustees 
although we have no present intention to do so  our board of trustees may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time without a vote of our security holders 
accordingly  our security holders have limited control over changes in our policies 
our declaration of trust and bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur 
if we become highly leveraged  then the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and harm our financial condition 
our declaration of trust contains provisions that make removal of our trustees difficult  which could make it difficult for our shareholders to effect changes to our management 
our declaration of trust provides that a trustee may be removed  with or without cause  only upon the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common shares 
vacancies may be filled by the board of trustees 
this requirement makes it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing trustees 
our bylaws may only be amended by our board of trustees  which could limit your control of certain aspects of our corporate governance 
our board of trustees has the sole authority to amend our bylaws 
thus  the board is able to amend the bylaws in a way that may be detrimental to your interests 
maryland law may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
maryland law provides broad discretion to our board of trustees with respect to their duties as trustees in considering a change in control of our company  including that our board is subject to no greater level of scrutiny in considering a change in control transaction than with respect to any other act by our board 
the maryland business combination act restricts mergers and other business combinations between our company and an interested shareholder for five years after the most recent date on which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder  and thereafter imposes special shareholder voting requirements on these combinations 
an interested shareholder is defined as any person who is the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of our common shares and also includes any of our affiliates or associates that  at any time within the two year period prior to the date of a proposed merger or other business combination  was the beneficial owner of or more of our voting power 
additionally  the control shares provisions of the maryland general corporation law  or mgcl  are applicable to us as if we were a corporation 
these provisions eliminate the voting rights of issued and outstanding shares acquired in quantities so as to constitute control shares  as defined under the mgcl  unless our shareholders approve such voting rights by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding all interested shares and shares held by our trustees and officers 
control shares are generally defined as shares which  when aggregated with other shares controlled by the shareholder  entitle the shareholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing trustees 
our amended and restated declaration of trust and or bylaws  provide that we are not bound by the maryland business combination act or the control share acquisition statute 
however  in the case of the control share acquisition statute  our board of trustees may opt to make this statute applicable to us at any time by amending our bylaws  and may do so on a retroactive basis 
we could also opt to make the maryland business combination act applicable to us by amending our declaration of trust by a vote of a majority of our outstanding common shares 
finally  the unsolicited takeovers provisions of the mgcl permit our board of trustees  without shareholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our declaration of trust or bylaws  to implement certain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common shares with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price or that shareholders may otherwise believe is in their best interests 

table of contents tax risks of our business and structure if we fail to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we will not be able to deduct our distributions  and our income will be subject to taxation  which would reduce the cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code commencing with our short taxable year ended december  the requirements for qualification as a reit  however  are complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing reits are limited 
the reit qualification rules are even more complicated for a reit that invests through an operating partnership  in various joint ventures  in other reits and in both equity and debt investments 
our continued qualification as a reit will depend on our ability to meet various requirements concerning  among other things  the ownership of our outstanding shares of beneficial interest  the nature of our assets  the sources of our income and the amount of our distributions to our shareholders 
if we fail to meet these requirements and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions  our distributions to our shareholders will not be deductible by us and we will be subject to a corporate level tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates  substantially reducing our cash available to make distributions to our shareholders 
in addition  if we failed to maintain our qualification as a reit  we would no longer be required to make distributions for federal income tax purposes 
incurring corporate income tax liability might cause us to borrow funds  liquidate some of our investments or take other steps that could negatively affect our operating results 
moreover  if our reit status is terminated because of our failure to meet a reit qualification requirement or if we voluntarily revoke our election  unless relief provisions applicable to certain reit qualification failures apply  we would be disqualified from electing treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which reit status is lost 
we may not qualify for relief provisions for reit qualification failures and even if we can qualify for such relief  we may be required to make penalty payments  which could be significant in amount 
even if we maintain our qualification as a reit  we are subject to any applicable state  local or foreign taxes and our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates 
failure of our operating partnership to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes would result in our failure to qualify as a reit 
failure of our operating partnership or a subsidiary partnership to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes would have serious adverse consequences to our shareholders 
if the irs were to successfully challenge the federal income tax status of our operating partnership or any of its subsidiary partnerships  our operating partnership or the affected subsidiary partnership would be taxable as a corporation 
in such event  we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to reits and  accordingly  would cease to qualify as a reit 
distribution requirements relating to qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes limit our flexibility in executing our business plan 
our long term business plan contemplates growth through acquisitions 
to maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we generally are required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding net capital gains for each of our taxable years 
to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
in addition  we are required to pay a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which actual distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income for that calendar year  of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and any amount of our undistributed taxable income required to be distributed from prior years 
we have distributed  and intend to continue to distribute  to our shareholders all or substantially all of our reit taxable income each year in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code and to eliminate all federal income tax liability at the reit level and liability for the nondeductible excise tax 
our distribution requirements limit our ability to accumulate capital for other business purposes  including funding acquisitions  debt maturities and capital expenditures 
thus  our ability to grow through acquisitions will be limited if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing 
in addition  differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in arriving at reit taxable income and the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow funds or make a taxable distribution of our shares or debt securities to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 

table of contents our disposal of properties may have negative implications  including unfavorable tax consequences 
if we make a sale of a property directly or through an entity that is treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership or a disregarded entity  and such sale is deemed to be a sale of dealer property or inventory  such sale may be deemed to be a prohibited transaction under the federal income tax laws applicable to reits  in which case our gain  or our share of the gain  from the sale would be subject to a penalty tax 
if we believe that a sale of a property might be treated as a prohibited transaction  we may seek to conduct that sales activity through a taxable reit subsidiary  in which case the gain from the sale would be subject to corporate income tax but not the prohibited transaction tax 
we cannot assure you  however  that the internal revenue service will not assert successfully that sales of properties that we make directly or through an entity that is treated as a partnership or a disregarded entity  for federal income tax purposes are sales of dealer property or inventory  in which case the penalty tax would apply 
moreover  we have entered and may enter into agreements with joint venture partners or contributors to our operating partnership that require us to indemnify  in whole or in part  such joint venture partners or such contributors for their tax obligations resulting from the recognition of gain in the case of taxable sales of certain contributed properties or a failure to maintain certain property level indebtedness on certain contributed properties for a period of years 
we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of our securities 
at any time  the federal income tax laws or regulations governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be amended 
we cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law  regulation or administrative interpretation  or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law  regulation or administrative interpretation  will be adopted  promulgated or become effective and any such law  regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively 
we and our shareholders  as the well as the market price of our securities  could be adversely affected by any such change in  or any new  federal income tax law  regulation or administrative interpretation 
dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 
the maximum federal income tax rate applicable to income from qualified dividends payable to us shareholders taxed at individual rates is 
dividends payable by reits  however  generally are not eligible for the reduced tax rates 
although such reduced tax rates do not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends payable by reits  the more favorable tax rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are taxed at individual rates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in shares of non reit corporations that pay dividends  which could adversely affect the market price of shares of reits  including our shares 
complying with reit requirements may force us to sell otherwise attractive investments 
to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy certain requirements with respect to the character of our assets 
if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter  we must correct such failure within days after the end of the calendar quarter by  possibly  selling assets notwithstanding their prospects as an investment to avoid losing our reit status 
if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter  and the failure exceeds a de minimis threshold  we may be able to preserve our reit status if a the failure was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect  b we dispose of the assets causing the failure within six months after the last day of the quarter in which we identified the failure  c we file a schedule with the internal revenue service describing each asset that caused the failure  and d we pay an additional tax of the greater of  or the product of the highest applicable tax rate multiplied by the net income generated on those assets 
as a result  we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
if we or our predecessor entity failed to qualify as an s corporation for any of our tax years prior to our initial public offering  we may fail to qualify as a reit 
to qualify and to maintain our qualification as a reit  we may not have at the close of any year undistributed earnings and profits accumulated in any non reit year  including undistributed earnings and profits accumulated in any non reit year for which we or our predecessor  first potomac realty investment trust  inc  did not qualify as an s corporation 
although we believe that we and our predecessor corporation qualified as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes for all tax years prior to our initial public offering  if it is determined that we or our predecessor did not so qualify  we would not have qualified as a reit for our short taxable year ended december  any such failure to qualify may also prevent us from qualifying as a reit for any of the following four tax years 

table of contents if first potomac management  inc failed to qualify as an s corporation during any of its tax years  we may be responsible for any entity level taxes due 
we believe first potomac management  inc qualified as an s corporation for federal and state income tax purposes from the time of its incorporation in through the date it merged into our company in however  the company may be responsible for any entity level taxes imposed on first potomac management  inc if it did not qualify as an s corporation at any time prior to the merger 
first potomac management  inc s former shareholders have severally indemnified us against any such loss  however  in the event one or more of its former shareholders is unable to fulfill its indemnification obligation  we may not be reimbursed for a portion of any taxes owed 
risks related to an investment in our equity securities our common and preferred shares trade in a limited market which could hinder your ability to sell our common or preferred shares 
our common shares experience relatively limited trading volume  many investors  particularly institutions  may not be interested or be permitted in owning our common shares because of the inability to acquire or sell a substantial block of our common shares at one time 
this illiquidity could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 
in addition  a shareholder may not be able to borrow funds using our common shares as collateral because lenders may be unwilling to accept the pledge of common shares having a limited market  thereby making our common shares a less attractive investment for some investors 
in addition  an active trading market on the nyse for our series a preferred shares issued in january which was our first issuance of preferred shares and march may not develop or  if it does develop  may not last  in which case the trading price of our series a preferred shares could be adversely affected or trade at prices lower than the initial offering price 
the market price and trading volume of our common and preferred shares may be volatile 
the market price of our common shares has been and may continue to be more volatile than in prior years and subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the trading volume in our common and preferred shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our common and preferred shares will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future  including as a result of factors unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common and preferred shares include actual or anticipated declines in our quarterly operating results or distributions  reductions in our funds from operations  declining occupancy rates or increased tenant defaults  general market and economic conditions  including continued volatility in the financial and credit markets  increases in market interest rates that lead purchasers of our securities to demand a higher dividend yield  changes in market valuations of similar companies  adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future  additions or departures of key management personnel  actions by institutional shareholders  our issuance of additional debt or preferred equity securities  speculation in the press or investment community  and unanticipated charges due to the vesting of equity based compensation awards upon achievement of certain performance measures that cause our operating results to decline or fail to meet market expectations 

table of contents an increase in market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 
one of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common shares is our distribution rate as a percentage of our share price  relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  prospective investors may desire a higher distribution rate on our common shares or seek securities paying higher dividends or interest 
the market price of our common shares likely will be based primarily on the earnings that we derive from rental income with respect to our properties and our related distributions to shareholders  and not from the underlying appraised value of the properties themselves 
as a result  interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions can affect the market price of our common shares 
for instance  if interest rates rise without an increase in our distribution rate  the market price of our common shares could decrease because potential investors may require a higher yield on our common shares as market rates on interest bearing securities  such as bonds  rise 
in addition  rising interest rates would result in increased interest expense on our non hedged variable rate debt  thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make distributions to our shareholders 
we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and we cannot assure you of our ability to pay dividends in the future or the amount of any dividends 
we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and our ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this annual report on form k and any risk factors in our subsequent filings with the sec 
for example  we significantly reduced our quarterly common share dividend during and  in january  announced a further reduction in our quarterly common share dividend to per share  which represents a reduction from the previous dividend rate of per share 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of trustees and their payment and amount will depend on our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status  compliance with our debt covenants and other factors as our board of trustees may deem relevant from time to time 
we cannot assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future or that the distributions will be made in amounts similar to our current distributions 
in particular  our outstanding debt  and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements  could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our equity securities  including paying dividends 
see risk factors risks related to our business and properties covenants in our debt agreements could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
further  distributions with respect to our common shares are subject to our ability to first satisfy our obligations to pay distributions to the holders of our series a preferred shares  and future offerings of preferred shares could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common shares 
in addition  some of our distributions may include a return of capital or may be taxable distributions of our shares or debt securities 
future offerings of debt securities  which would rank senior to our common and preferred shares upon liquidation  and future offerings of equity securities  which would dilute our existing shareholders and may be senior to our common shares or senior to or on parity with our preferred shares for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions  may adversely affect the market price of our equity securities 
in the future  particularly as we seek to acquire and develop additional real estate assets consistent with our growth strategy  we may attempt to increase our capital resources through debt offerings or additional equity offerings  including senior or subordinated notes and series of preferred shares or common shares 
for example  between and  we sold approximately million common shares and million preferred shares in underwritten public offerings and approximately million common shares through our controlled equity program 
our preferred shares will rank junior to all of our existing and future debt and to other non equity claims on us and our assets available to satisfy claims against us  including claims in bankruptcy  liquidation or similar proceedings 
further  upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and preferred shares and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common shares 
additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our equity securities  or both 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  holders of our equity securities bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our equity securities and diluting their share holdings in us 
shares eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  of future sales of common shares  or the availability of shares for future sales  on the market price of our common shares 
sales of substantial amounts of common shares  including common shares issuable upon the redemption of units of our operating partnership and exercise of options  or the perception that these sales could occur  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common shares and impede our ability to raise capital 
any substantial sale of our common shares could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 

table of contents the company also may issue from time to time additional common shares or preferred shares or units of our operating partnership in connection with the acquisition of properties  and we may grant demand or piggyback registration rights in connection with these issuances 
for example  in  we issued approximately million units of our operating partnership in connection with the acquisition of an office property in washington  dc and granted the holders of those units registration rights 
sales of substantial amounts of securities or the perception that these sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our securities 
in addition  the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through a sale of additional equity securities 
holders of series a preferred shares have extremely limited voting rights 
holders of series a preferred shares have extremely limited voting rights 
our common shares are the only class of our equity securities carrying full voting rights 
voting rights for holders of series a preferred shares exist primarily with respect to the ability to appoint additional trustees to our board of trustees in the event that six quarterly dividends whether or not consecutive payable on our series a preferred shares are in arrears  and with respect to voting on amendments to our declaration of trust or our series a preferred shares articles supplementary that materially and adversely affect the rights of series a preferred shares holders or create additional classes or series of preferred shares that are senior to our series a preferred shares 
other than very limited circumstances  holders of series a preferred shares will not have voting rights

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap that require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require subjective or complex judgments and are the policies and estimates that the company deems most important to the portrayal of its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
it is possible that the use of different reasonable estimates or assumptions in making these judgments could result in materially different amounts being reported in its consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition  including evaluation of the collectability of accounts and notes receivable  impairment of long lived assets  purchase accounting for acquisitions of real estate  derivative instruments and share based compensation 

table of contents the following is a summary of certain aspects of these critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition the company generates substantially all of its revenue from leases on its office and industrial properties as well as business parks 
the company recognizes rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of its leases  which includes fixed rate renewal periods leased at below market rates at acquisition or inception 
accrued straight line rents represent the difference between rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective lease agreements and the rental payments contractually due for leases that contain abatement or fixed periodic increases 
the company considers current information  credit quality  historical trends  economic conditions and other events regarding the tenants ability to pay their obligations in determining if amounts due from tenants  including accrued straight line rents  are ultimately collectible 
the uncollectible portion of the amounts due from tenants  including accrued straight line rents  is charged to property operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
tenant leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes incurred by the company 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period in which the expenses are incurred 
the company records a provision for losses on estimated uncollectible accounts receivable based on its analysis of risk of loss on specific accounts 
lease termination fees are recognized on the date of termination when the related lease or portion thereof is cancelled  the collectability of the fee is reasonably assured and the company has possession of the terminated space 
accounts and notes receivable the company must make estimates of the collectability of its accounts and notes receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  tenant reimbursements  lease termination fees and interest and other income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income as a higher required allowance for doubtful accounts receivable will result in lower net income 
the uncollectible portion of the amounts due from tenants  including straight line rents  is charged to property operating expense in the period in which the determination is made 
the company considers similar criteria in assessing impairment associated with outstanding loans or notes receivable and whether any allowance for anticipated credit loss is appropriate 
investments in real estate and real estate entities investments in real estate and real estate entities are initially recorded at fair value if acquired in a business combination or carried at initial cost when constructed or acquired in an asset purchase  less accumulated depreciation and  when appropriate  impairment losses 
improvements and replacements are capitalized at cost when they extend the useful life  increase capacity or improve the efficiency of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives of the company s assets  by class  are as follows buildings years building improvements to years furniture  fixtures and equipment to years lease related intangible assets the term of the related lease tenant improvements shorter of the useful life of the asset or the term of the related lease the company regularly reviews market conditions for possible impairment of a property s carrying value 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions  changes in management s intended holding period or potential sale to a third party indicate a possible impairment of the fair value of a property  an impairment analysis is performed 
the company assesses potential impairments based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition 
this estimate is based on projections of future revenues  expenses  capital improvement costs  expected holding periods and capitalization rates 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected market trends and leasing prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment based on forecasted undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
the company is required to make estimates as to whether there are impairments in the carrying values of its investments in real estate 
further  the company will record an impairment loss if it expects to dispose of a property  in the near term  at a price below carrying value 
in such an event  the company will record an impairment loss based on the difference between a property s carrying value and its projected sales price  less any estimated costs to sell 

table of contents the company will classify a building as held for sale in accordance with gaap in the period in which it has made the decision to dispose of the building  the company s board of trustees or a designated delegate has approved the sale  there is a high likelihood a binding agreement to purchase the property will be signed under which the buyer will be required to commit a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant financing contingencies will exist that could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner 
if these criteria are met  the company will cease depreciation of the asset 
the company will classify any impairment loss  together with the building s operating results  as discontinued operations in its consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale in its consolidated balance sheets in the period the held for sale criteria are met 
interest expense is reclassified to discontinued operations only to the extent the held for sale property is secured by specific mortgage debt and the mortgage debt will not be assigned to another property owned by the company after the disposition 
the company recognizes the fair value  if sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate the fair value  of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations when incurred  which is generally upon acquisition  construction  development or redevelopment and or through the normal operation of the asset 
the company capitalizes interest costs incurred on qualifying expenditures for real estate assets under development or redevelopment  which include its investments in assets owned through unconsolidated joint ventures that are under development or redevelopment  while being readied for their intended use in accordance with accounting requirements regarding capitalization of interest 
the company will capitalize interest when qualifying expenditures for the asset have been made  activities necessary to get the asset ready for its intended use are in progress and interest costs are being incurred 
capitalized interest also includes interest associated with expenditures incurred to acquire developable land while development activities are in progress and interest on the direct compensation costs of the company s construction personnel who manage the development and redevelopment projects  but only to the extent the employee s time can be allocated to a project 
any portion of construction management costs not directly attributable to a specific project are recognized as general and administrative expense in the period incurred 
the company does not capitalize any other general administrative costs such as office supplies  office rent expense or an overhead allocation to its development or redevelopment projects 
capitalized compensation costs were immaterial during  and capitalization of interest will end when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use  but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity  if the property is not occupied 
the company will also place redevelopment and development assets in service at this time and commence depreciation upon the substantial completion of tenant improvements and the recognition of revenue 
capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying assets  commencing when those assets are placed into service 
purchase accounting acquisitions of rental property  including any associated intangible assets  are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition 
any liabilities assumed or incurred are recorded at their fair value at the time of acquisition 
the fair value of the acquired property is allocated between land and building on an as if vacant basis based on management s estimate of the fair value of those components for each type of property and to tenant improvements based on the depreciated replacement cost of the tenant improvements  which approximates their fair value 
the fair value of the in place leases is recorded as follows the fair value of leases in place on the date of acquisition is based on absorption costs for the estimated lease up period in which vacancy and foregone revenue are avoided due to the presence of the acquired leases  the fair value of above and below market in place leases based on the present value using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between the contractual rent amounts to be paid under the assumed lease and the estimated market lease rates for the corresponding spaces over the remaining non cancelable terms of the related leases  which range from one to fifteen years  and the fair value of intangible tenant or customer relationships 
the company s determination of these fair values requires it to estimate market rents for each of the leases and make certain other assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the rental revenue  and depreciation and amortization expense recognized for these leases and associated intangible assets and liabilities 

table of contents derivative instruments the company is exposed to certain risks arising from business operations and economic factors 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities in which its future exposure to interest rate fluctuations is unknown 
the objective in the use of an interest rate derivative is to add stability to interest expenses and manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and intends to enter into derivative agreements only with counterparties that it believes have a strong credit rating to mitigate the risk of counterparty default or insolvency 
no hedging activity can completely insulate the company from the risks associated with changes in interest rates 
moreover  interest rate hedging could fail to protect the company or adversely affect it because  among other things available interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which the company seeks protection  the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability  the party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay  and the credit quality of the party owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs the company s ability to sell or assign its side of the hedging transaction 
the company may designate a derivative as either a hedge of the cash flows from a debt instrument or anticipated transaction cash flow hedge or a hedge of the fair value of a debt instrument fair value hedge 
all derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities at fair value 
for effective hedging relationships  the change in the fair value of the assets or liabilities is recorded within equity cash flow hedge or through earnings fair value hedge 
ineffective portions of derivative transactions will result in changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
for a cash flow hedge  the company records its proportionate share of unrealized gains or losses on its derivative instruments associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures within equity and investment in affiliates 
the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  the company has considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual inputs and guarantees 
share based payments the company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
for options awards  the company uses a black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on an assessment of the company s realized volatility over the preceding period that is equivalent to the award s expected life 
the expected term represents the period of time the options are anticipated to remain outstanding as well as the company s historical experience for groupings of employees that have similar behavior and considered separately for valuation purposes 
for non vested share awards that vest over a predetermined time period  the company uses the outstanding share price at the date of issuance to fair value the awards 
for non vested shares awards that vest based on performance conditions  the company uses a monte carlo simulation risk neutral approach to determine the value and derived service period of each tranche 
the expense associated with the share based awards will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
the fair value for all share based payment transactions are recognized as a component of income or loss from continuing operations

derivative financial instruments the company is exposed to certain risks arising from business operations and economic factors

the company intends to complete the improvements in satisfaction of these obligations 
the company had no other material contractual obligations as of december  funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a non gaap measure used by many investors and analysts that follow the real estate industry 
the company considers ffo a useful measure of performance for an equity reit because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of its properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization  which assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  the company believes that ffo provides a meaningful indication of its performance 
the company also considers ffo an appropriate supplemental performance measure given its wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts 
ffo  reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions  principally adjusts for the effects of gaap depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  which assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  represents net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses on sales of real estate and impairments of real estate assets  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with nareit s definition  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo  or similarly titled measures  used by other companies and this may not be comparable to those presentations 
historically  the company did not exclude impairments in its computation of ffo 
however  on october   nareit clarified that the exclusion of impairment write downs of depreciable assets in reported ffo was always intended and appropriate 
as a result  the company began excluding impairments from ffo in the fourth quarter of and has restated ffo from prior periods to exclude such charges consistent with nareit s guidance 
in addition  the company s methodology for computing ffo adds back noncontrolling interests in the income from its operating partnership in determining ffo 
the company believes this is appropriate as operating partnership units are presented on an as converted  one for one basis for shares of stock in determining ffo per diluted share 
ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the company presents ffo per diluted share calculations that are based on the outstanding dilutive common shares plus the outstanding common operating partnership units for the periods presented 
the company s presentation of ffo in accordance with nareit s definition  or as adjusted by the company  should not be considered as an alternative to net income computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of its liquidity
