item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  without limitation  those set forth in cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused on frontier and emerging areas in africa and south america 
our asset portfolio includes existing production and other major project developments offshore ghana  as well as exploration licenses with significant hydrocarbon potential offshore mauritania  morocco and suriname and onshore cameroon 
we were incorporated pursuant to the laws of bermuda as kosmos energy ltd 
in january to become a holding company for kosmos energy holdings 
pursuant to the terms of a corporate reorganization that was completed immediately prior to the closing of kosmos energy ltd 
s ipo on may   all of the interests in kosmos energy holdings were exchanged for newly issued common shares of kosmos energy ltd 
as a result  kosmos energy holdings became wholly owned by kosmos energy ltd 
recent developments on november   we entered into the revolving credit facility the corporate revolver 
the total size of the corporate revolver is million  with million of commitments initially available to us and an additional million of commitments being available if such lenders choose to increase their commitments or if commitments from new financial institutions are added 
in connection with the corporate revolver  we also amended and restated the billion commercial debt facility the facility to cancel million of unused commitments  cancel the uncommitted billion accordion and add certain financial covenants  among other things 
as a result of the transaction  million of deferred financing costs were written off as a loss on extinguishment of debt 
ghana during  we had six liftings of oil totaling  mbbl from the jubilee field production resulting in revenues of million 
our average realized price was per barrel 
we have received an approval for the phase a pod of the jubilee field  with production from phase a commencing in late drilling of the phase a wells is expected to be completed in and includes eight additional wells  including five production wells and three water injection wells 
in january  the ntomme a appraisal well confirmed a downdip extension of the ntomme field on the dt block 
the well encountered high quality stacked reservoir sandstones 
a drill stem test was performed on the well in may  which successfully flowed oil from multiple zones in the reservoir and confirmed continuity with the ntomme discovery well 
fluid samples recovered from the well indicate an oil gravity of approximately degrees api 
in march  the enyenra a appraisal well confirmed a downdip extension of the enyenra light oil field on the dt block 
analysis of well results  including wireline logs  reservoir pressures and fluid samples  indicated the enyenra a well encountered oil bearing pay 
fluid samples recovered from the well indicate an oil gravity of approximately degrees api 
in march  the owo ra discovery well of the enyenra field drill stem test was successful in encountering oil flow across three zones 

table of contents drilling of the teak a appraisal well was completed in may the well encountered non commercial reservoirs and accordingly was plugged and abandoned 
total well related costs incurred from inception of million are included in exploration expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for in july  the wawa exploration well made a hydrocarbon discovery on the dt block 
analysis of well results  including wireline logs  reservoir pressures and fluid samples  indicated the well encountered gas condensate and oil bearing pay 
fluid samples recovered from the well indicate an oil gravity of between and degrees api 
in august  a drill stem test performed on the akasa well on the wctp block was successful in encountering oil flow 
in november  we submitted a declaration of commerciality and plan of development covering the tweneboa  enyenra and ntomme discoveries the ten pod on the dt block 
the ten pod plans for a flexible and expandable development  with an initial base capacity of  barrels of oil per day 
the final development concept is subject to approval from the government of ghana 
drilling of the okure exploration well on the dt block was completed in december the well encountered non commercial reservoirs and accordingly was plugged and abandoned 
total well related costs incurred from inception of million are included in exploration expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the sapele exploration well on the dt block was spud in december drilling of the well was completed in february the well is not considered a productive well and accordingly will be plugged and abandoned 
in january  we relinquished the discovery area associated with the banda discovery on the wctp block  as we do not consider this discovery to be commercially viable 
as the exploration phase of the wctp pa has expired  we no longer have any rights to this discovery area unless we enter into a new petroleum agreement with the ghana ministry of energy and the ghana national petroleum company covering this and other relinquished areas of the wctp block 
this relinquishment is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended march   as we have previously recorded the unsuccessful well costs associated with the banda exploration well as exploration expenses 
cameroon in january  kosmos entered into a petroleum contract with the republic of cameroon for the fako block 
kosmos is the operator and has a participating interest in the block 
the republic of cameroon has an option to acquire an interest of up to in a commercial discovery on the block 
the block covers  acres  square kilometers and borders the southeast portion of our ndian river block in the rio del rey basin 
in october  the current renewal period of the ndian river block was extended through november  and carries a one well obligation 
the sipo exploration well on the ndian river block spud in february this well is expected to reach its target depth in april mauritania in april  we completed negotiations with mauritania ministry of petroleum  energy and mines and executed separate petroleum contracts covering blocks c  c and c offshore mauritania 
kosmos is the operator and has a participating interest in each of these blocks 
the government of mauritania has a carried interest during the exploration period and the option to participate in any discovery on these blocks  and if it elects to exercise such option its participation 
table of contents interest would be between and 
the first phase of the exploration period of the petroleum contract covering each of the blocks is four years in duration 
these contracts were officially gazetted by the government of mauritania on june   thereby establishing the effective date for the petroleum contracts 
in order to conform the southern boundaries of blocks c and c with the mauritanian border with senegal  the petroleum contracts were amended in september the total area covered by the blocks in now million acres  square kilometers 
the blocks are located within the western margin of the proven mauritanian salt basin  on the atlantic passive margin 
the source rock in the basin is the same age and type as the source rock generated by the petroleum system in the jubilee field 
additionally  we believe the play model in the basin is similar to the play model found in the jubilee field 
a petroleum system in mauritania has been proven by the presence of offshore producing fields in adjacent blocks to those which we hold 
during the first half of  we anticipate initiating a d seismic data acquisition program on approximately  line kilometers  covering portions of all three blocks 
based on interpretation of results of the d seismic data  a d seismic program will be targeted for commencement in morocco in march  we completed a  square kilometer d seismic acquisition program which covered the essaouira offshore block and the foum assaka block  both in the agadir basin offshore morocco 
processing and interpretation of the data continues 
in october  the moroccan government issued a joint ministerial order approving our acquisition of the additional participating interest from pathfinder  a wholly owned subsidiary of fastnet  one of our block partners 
upon receipt of this order  we closed the acquisition of such additional participating interest with pathfinder 
we expect final governmental processes required to officially reflect the acquisition under moroccan law to be completed in due course 
after giving effect to the acquisition  our participating interest in the foum assaka offshore block is 
in september  kosmos entered into an agreement to acquire an additional participating interest in the essaouira offshore block from canamens energy morocco sarl  one of our block partners 
certain governmental approvals and processes are still required to be completed before this acquisition can be closed 
after completing the acquisition  our participating interest in the essaouira offshore block will be 
in september  kosmos made its election under the tarhazoute reconnaissance contract to enter into a petroleum contract 
negotiation of the petroleum contract and associated documents is currently ongoing 
we anticipate we will be the operator of the license and hold a participating interest 
suriname in november  kosmos closed an agreement with chevron under which kosmos assigned half of its interest in block and block  offshore suriname  to chevron 
each party now has a participating interest in block and block in october  we completed a d seismic data acquisition program which covered approximately  square kilometers of portions of block and block  both in the suriname guyana basin 
processing of the data is ongoing

as a result of these transactions  million of deferred financing costs were written off as a loss on extinguishment of debt 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in the unrealized loss on the interest rate derivative instruments related to changes in fair value and a lower weighted average interest rate on the facility  partially offset by an accrual for transaction taxes during the year ended december  derivatives  net

our average production cost per barrel was 
in  there were no oil sales and  therefore  no associated oil and gas production costs

the company recognized an income tax provision attributable to earnings of million during and an income tax benefit of million during the company effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the large variance in income taxes between and is due to the release of a valuation allowance related to the ghana operations in the large effective tax rate in is primarily due to the fact that no tax benefit is currently being provided on losses in jurisdictions with a full valuation allowance and jurisdictions where no income tax is assessed 
liquidity and capital resources we are actively engaged in an ongoing process of anticipating and meeting our funding requirements related to exploring for and developing oil and natural gas resources in africa and south america 
we have historically secured funding from issuances of equity and commercial debt facilities to meet our ongoing liquidity requirements 
we received our first oil sales in january from jubilee 
table of contents field production  which generated cash flows from operations during and accordingly  the cash flows generated from our operating activities may also provide an additional source of future funding 
significant sources of capital facility in march  the company secured a billion commercial debt facility the facility from a number of financial institutions and extinguished the then existing commercial debt facilities 
the facility was syndicated to certain participants of the existing facilities  as well as new participants 
the facility supports our oil and gas exploration  appraisal and development programs and corporate activities 
in february  the company amended the facility 
the terms and conditions of the facility remained consistent with the original terms and conditions  however  the international finance corporation entered the facility 
the total commitment under the facility remained unchanged at billion 
in november  the company again amended the facility 
as part of the amendment  we cancelled million of unused commitments from the facility  reducing the total commitments to billion 
as a result of the transaction  million of deferred financing costs were written off as a loss on extinguishment of debt 
as of december   borrowings under the facility totaled billion and the undrawn availability under the facility was million

interest is payable on the last day of each interest period and  if the interest period is longer than six months  on the dates falling at six month intervals after the first day of the interest period 
we pay commitment fees on the undrawn and unavailable portion of the total commitments 
commitment fees are equal to per annum of the then applicable respective margin when a commitment is available for utilization and  equal to per annum of the then applicable respective margin when a commitment is not available for utilization 
we recognize interest expense in accordance with asc interest  which requires interest expense to be recognized using the effective interest method 
we determined the effective interest rate based on the estimated level of future borrowings under the facility 
the facility provides a revolving credit and letter of credit facility for an availability period that expires on may  in the case of the revolving credit facility and on the final maturity date in the case of the letter of credit facility 
the available facility amount is subject to borrowing base constraints and is also constrained by an amortization schedule once repayments under the facility begin

the first required payment could be as early as march   subject to the level of outstanding borrowings and the borrowing base constraints 
the facility has a final maturity date of march  we have the right to cancel all the undrawn commitments under the facility 
the amount of funds available to be borrowed under the facility  also known as the borrowing base amount  is determined each year on march and september as part of a forecast that is prepared by and agreed to by us and the technical and modeling banks 
the formula to calculate the borrowing base amount is based  in part  on the sum of the net present values of net cash flows and relevant capital expenditures reduced by certain percentages

we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the facility as of the october  forecast the most recent assessment date  which requires the maintenance of the field life cover ratio as defined in the glossary  not less than x  and the loan life cover ratio as defined in the glossary  not less than x 
in connection with the november amendment to the facility  certain terms of the facility were amended as follows the addition of certain financial covenants such that the company is required every six months or on a pro forma basis upon giving effect to certain specified transactions to maintain the debt cover ratio as defined in the glossary  not more than x  and the interest cover ratio as defined in the glossary  not less than x  to allow proceeds from any project permitted to be funded by the facility to be used  in accordance with certain payment priority provisions  to pay amounts of interest due under  and fees and expenses related to  the million corporate revolver and certain other debt that may be incurred by the company  the cancellation of the right of the company to increase the facility commitments beyond billion ie the cancellation of the uncommitted billion accordion  to permit i subsidiaries of the company other than certain of the company indirect subsidiaries which hold interests in kosmos energy ghana hc to incur certain indebtedness and guarantees  and grant certain liens over their assets  and ii the ghana obligors to guarantee the corporate revolver and certain other debt that may be incurred by the company on a subordinated basis  in each case to the extent permitted by the amended and restated facility agreement and the intercreditor agreement entered into by us and the lenders under the facility and the corporate revolver  the exclusion of certain of the company subsidiaries doing business in cameroon and morocco from i the restrictions contained in the charge granted to the lenders under the facility over the company subsidiary  kosmos energy operating  being the intermediate parent of such subsidiaries doing business in cameroon and morocco  and ii the receipt of funds from draws under the facility  and to make certain other amendments to the terms of the facility 
corporate revolver in november  we secured a corporate revolver from a number of financial institutions 
as of december   we had million of commitments under the corporate revolver 
availability under the corporate revolver may be increased up to million if existing lenders increase their commitments or if commitments from new financial institutions are added 
the corporate revolver is available for all subsidiaries for general corporate purposes and for oil and gas exploration  appraisal and development programs and corporate activities 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the corporate revolver and the undrawn availability under the corporate revolver was million 

table of contents interest is the aggregate of the applicable margin  libor and mandatory cost if any  as defined in the corporate revolver 
interest is payable on the last day of each interest period and  if the interest period is longer than six months  on the dates falling at six month intervals after the first day of the interest period 
we pay commitment fees on the undrawn portion of the total commitments 
commitment fees for the lenders are equal to per annum of the respective margin when a commitment is available for utilization 
the corporate revolver has a year availability period that expires on november  the available amount is not subject to borrowing base constraints

we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the corporate revolver as of november  the most recent assessment date  which requires the maintenance of the debt cover ratio as defined in the glossary  not more than x  and the interest cover ratio as defined in the glossary  not less than x 
the us and many foreign economies continue to experience uncertainty driven by varying macroeconomic conditions 
although some of these economies have shown signs of improvement  macroeconomic recovery remains uneven 
uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and associated global economic conditions have resulted in extreme volatility in credit  equity  and foreign currency markets  including the european sovereign debt markets and volatility in various other markets 
if any of the financial institutions within our facility or corporate revolver are unable to perform on their commitments  our liquidity could be impacted 
we actively monitor all of the financial institutions participating in our facility and corporate revolver 
none of the financial institutions have indicated to us that they may be unable to perform on their commitments 
in addition  we periodically review our banking and financing relationships  considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships 
based on our monitoring activities  we currently believe our banks will be able to perform on their commitments 
capital expenditures and investments we expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to develop our oil and natural gas prospects and as we complete our exploration and appraisal drilling program in our license areas  develop our discoveries that we determine to be commercially viable  purchase and analyze seismic and other geological and geophysical data to identify future prospects  and invest in additional oil and natural gas leases and licenses 
we have relied on a number of assumptions in budgeting for our future activities 
these include the number of wells we plan to drill  our participating interests in our prospects  the costs involved in developing or participating in the development of a prospect  the timing of third party projects  and the availability of suitable equipment and qualified personnel 
these assumptions are inherently subject to significant business  political  economic  regulatory  environmental and competitive uncertainties  contingencies and risks  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
we may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions proves to be 
table of contents incorrect or if we choose to expand our hydrocarbon asset acquisition  exploration  appraisal  development efforts or any other activity more rapidly than we presently anticipate 
we may decide to raise additional funds before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
we may seek to sell equity or debt securities or obtain additional bank credit facilities 
the sale of equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders 
the incurrence of additional indebtedness could result in increased fixed obligations and additional covenants that could restrict our operations 
capital program we estimate we will incur approximately million of capital expenditures for the year ending december  this capital expenditure budget consists of approximately for developmental related expenditures offshore ghana  and approximately for exploration and appraisal related expenditures  including new venture opportunities 
the ultimate amount of capital we will spend may fluctuate materially based on market conditions and the success of our drilling results 
our future financial condition and liquidity will be impacted by  among other factors  our level of production of oil and the prices we receive from the sale of these commodities  the success of our exploration and appraisal drilling program  the number of commercially viable oil and natural gas discoveries made and the quantities of oil and natural gas discovered  the speed with which we can bring such discoveries to production  and the actual cost of exploration  appraisal and development of our oil and natural gas assets

net cash provided by operating activities in was million compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million in and net cash used in operating activities of million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities in when compared to was primarily due to positive change in working capital items which offset a decrease in results from operations 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in when compared to was primarily due to sales of oil from the jubilee field which did not exist in 
table of contents investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in was million compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in when compared to was primarily attributable to changes in restricted cash  notes receivable and expenditures for oil and gas assets primarily in ghana for development activities 
the decrease in cash used in when compared to was primarily attributable to changes in restricted cash  notes receivable and expenditures for oil and gas assets primarily in ghana for development activities

financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities in was million compared with net cash provided by financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities for when compared to was primarily due to net proceeds received from the ipo of million received in and an increase in net payments under long term debt 
the decrease in cash provided in when compared to was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings under long term debt of million which offset net proceeds from the ipo of million 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes by period the payments due for our estimated contractual obligations as of december  payments due by year total thereafter in thousands operating leases facility interest payments on long term debt the amounts included in the table represent principal maturities only 
the scheduled maturities of debt are based on the level of borrowings and the available borrowing base as of december  any increases or decreases in the level of borrowings or increases or decreases in the available borrowing base would impact the scheduled maturities of debt during the next five years and thereafter

critical accounting policies this discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date the financial statements are available to be issued 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are detailed in item financial statements and supplementary data note accounting policies 
we have outlined below certain accounting policies that are of particular importance to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment or estimates by our management 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we use the sales method of accounting for oil and gas revenues 
under this method  we recognize revenues on the volumes sold based on the provisional sales prices 
the volumes sold may be more or less than the volumes to which we are entitled based on our ownership interest in the property 
these differences result in a condition known in the industry as a production imbalance 
a receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance on a specific property greater than the expected remaining proved reserves on such property 
as of december  and  we had no oil and gas imbalances recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
our oil and gas revenues are based on provisional price contracts which contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes 
the host contract is the receivable from oil sales at the spot price on the date of sale 
the embedded derivative  which is not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes  is marked to market through oil and gas revenue each period until the final settlement occurs  which generally is limited to the month after the sale occurs 
exploration and development costs 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred 
costs of unproved properties are transferred to proved properties when a determination that proved reserves have been found 
exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying unproved properties  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred 
if exploratory wells are determined to be commercially unsuccessful or dry holes  the applicable costs are expensed 
costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized 
costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and equipment and to lift crude oil and natural gas to the surface are expensed 
receivables 
our receivables consist of joint interest billings  oil sales  notes and other receivables for which we generally do not require collateral security 
receivables from joint interest owners are stated at amounts due  net of any allowances for doubtful accounts 
we determine our allowance by considering the length of time past due  future net revenues of the debtor ownership interest in oil and natural gas properties we operate  and the owner ability to pay its obligation  among other things 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes as required by the asc income taxes asc 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
our federal  state and international tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared  therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits  and net operating loss carryforwards 
adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns 
further  we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize or utilize our deferred tax assets 
if realization is not more likely than not  we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover  which would result in no benefit for the deferred tax amounts 
as of december  and  we have a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
if our estimates and judgments regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets change  the benefits associated with those deferred tax assets may increase or decrease in the period our estimates and judgments change 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates the need for and adequacy of valuation allowances based on the expected realizability of the deferred tax asses and adjusts the amount of such allowances  if necessary 

table of contents asc provides a more likely than not standard in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is necessary after weighing all of the available evidence 
when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including the following the status of our operations in the particular taxing jurisdiction including whether we have commenced production from a commercial discovery  whether a commercial discovery has resulted in significant proved reserves that have been independently verified  the amounts and history of taxable income or losses in a particular jurisdiction  projections of future taxable income  including the sensitivity of such projections to changes in production volumes and prices  the existence  or lack thereof  of statutory limitations on the period that net operating losses may be carried forward in a jurisdication  and the creation and timing of future taxable income associated with the turn around of deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we utilize oil derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with our anticipated future oil production 
these derivative contracts consist of three way collars 
we also use interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to our long term debt 
our derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either assets or a liabilities measured at fair value 
we do not apply hedge accounting to our oil derivative contracts 
effective june   we discontinued hedge accounting on our interest rate swap contracts and accordingly the changes in the fair value of the instruments are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
the effective portions of the discontinued hedges as of may   are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss aoci in the equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  and are being transferred to earnings when the hedged transaction settles 
estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows affect our periodic calculations of depletion and assessment of impairment of our oil and natural gas properties 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
as additional proved reserves are discovered  reserve quantities and future cash flows will be estimated by independent petroleum consultants and prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec and the fasb 
the accuracy of these reserve estimates is a function of the engineering and geological interpretation of available data  estimates of the amount and timing of future operating cost  production taxes  development cost and workover cost  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the persons preparing the estimates 
asset retirement obligations 
we account for asset retirement obligations as required by the asc asset retirement and environmental obligations 
under these standards  the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
if a reasonable estimate of fair value cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred  the liability is recognized when a reasonable 
table of contents estimate of fair value can be made 
if a tangible long lived asset with an existing asset retirement obligation is acquired  a liability for that obligation shall be recognized at the asset acquisition date as if that obligation were incurred on that date 
in addition  a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
we capitalize the asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by the same amount as the liability 
we record increases in the discounted abandonment liability resulting from the passage of time in depletion and depreciation in the consolidated statement of operations 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
additionally  asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligations  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
asc property  plant and equipment requires an impairment loss to be recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
that assessment shall be based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability  whether in use or under development 
an impairment loss shall be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to us are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  to improve reporting and transparency of offsetting netting assets and liabilities and the related affects on the financial statements 
this asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after january  we do not expect the adoption of this asu will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risks as it relates to our currently anticipated transactions refers to the risk of loss arising from changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
these disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage ongoing market risk exposures 
we enter into market risk sensitive instruments for purposes other than to speculate 
we manage market and counterparty credit risk in accordance with policies and guidelines 
in accordance with these policies and guidelines  our management determines the appropriate timing and extent of derivative transactions

interest rate sensitivity at december   we had indebtedness outstanding under the facility of billion  of which million bore interest at floating rates 
the interest rate on this indebtedness as of december  was approximately 
if libor increased at this level of floating rate debt  we would pay an additional million in interest expense per year on the facility 
we pay commitment fees on the million of undrawn availability and million of unavailable commitments under the facility and on the million of undrawn availability under the corporate revolver  which are not subject to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the fair market value of our interest rate swaps was a net liability of approximately million 
if libor increased by  we estimate the liability would decrease to approximately million  and if libor decreased by  we estimate the liability would increase to approximately million
