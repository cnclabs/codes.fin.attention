our executive office is located at south wacker drive  suite  chicago  illinois our telephone number is our common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol nci 
general development of the business since our inception  we have grown through the recruitment of new consultants combined with acquisition investments of select firms that are complementary to our business 
we completed a strategic review during and based on the results of that review we have been focused on managing our resources and concentrating on fewer practice areas that have growth potential and where we believe we enjoy scale and competitive advantages 
we combine achieved organic growth with strategic acquisitions that are complementary to our service offerings across all our segments 
over the past four years we have invested approximately million in businesses 
in  we acquired summit blue to bolster our presence within the energy segment  specifically energy efficiency  demand side management  smart grid and renewable energy strategies 
in  we expanded our healthcare segment with the acquisition of ethospartners  a national healthcare consulting group specializing in physician practice operations and revenue cycle managements  grew our financial  risk compliance advisory segment specifically within the anti money laundering  regulatory compliance and anti corruption areas with the acquisition of daylight forensics advisory  llc and added to our economics capabilities in the washington  dc market within the disputes  investigations economics segment with the acquisition of empiris  llc

in  we expanded our business strategy advisory services to companies in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries through the acquisition of easton associates  llc and expanded our healthcare advisory services through the acquisition of empath consulting  a provider of hospital work flow management and process control systems 
additionally  we grew our energy segment through the acquisition of pike research  llc a market intelligence firm focused on the global clean energy and smart technology markets 
in december  we acquired afe consulting in order to broaden our range of economics knowledge and expertise within the disputes  investigations economics segment 
we also acquired several smaller businesses to further complement our existing services 
in addition to our acquisitions we continue to strengthen our team of recognized experts and thought leaders across various industries 
in recent years we have hired over senior level consultants 
in addition to the growth discussed above  we continue to operate other businesses that complement our focus areas 
more recently  we have invested in our information technology infrastructure to support the technology enabled initiatives across all of our segments 
these services include e discovery services  data analytics  technology solutions  invoice and insurance claims processing  market research and benchmarking 
in addition to investing in talent retention  acquisitions and technology our strong cash flows have contributed to strengthening our financial position 
over the same four year period  we have reduced our bank debt balance from million to million 
in addition  in we began a stock buyback program and through december  have repurchased million shares at an average price of per share 
human capital resources at december   we had  employees 
after adjusting total employees for part time status  we had  full time equivalent fte employees 
these fte employees were comprised of the following  consultants in businesses that deliver professional services who record time to client engagements 
technology  data process professionals in businesses that are comprised of technology enabled professional services  including e discovery services and data analytics  technology solutions  invoice and insurance claims processing  market research and benchmarking 
these individuals may record time to client engagements in professional services engagements  though many do not record time to specific engagements 
project employees who perform client services on a contractual basis 
project employee levels vary from period to period based on staffing and resource requirements 
non billable employees who are assigned to administrative and support functions  including office services  corporate functions  and certain practice support functions 
the majority of costs related to these employees is recorded in general and administrative expense while the costs directly relating to practice support functions are recorded as costs of services before reimbursements 
our revenues are primarily generated from services performed by our consultants  therefore  our success depends in large part on attracting  retaining and motivating talented  creative and experienced consultants at all levels and across geographies 
we have acquired and seek to acquire these individuals through both recruitment and acquisitions of businesses 
in connection with recruiting  we employ internal recruiters  retain executive search firms  and utilize personal and business contacts 
our consultants are drawn from the industries we serve  from accounting and other consulting organizations  and from top rated colleges and universities 
our consultants include  but are not limited to  phds  mds  mbas  jds  cpas  cras certified risk analysts  cfes certified fraud examiners  asas accredited senior appraisers  engineers  nurses and former government officials 
in addition to recruiting consultants  we have acquired and seek to acquire certain consulting businesses to add highly skilled consultants to enhance our service offerings and to expand our geographical footprint 
we believe that the strategy of selectively acquiring consulting businesses and hiring additional consulting capabilities strengthens our platform  market share and overall operating results 
we retain our employees by offering competitive compensation packages of base and incentive compensation  and in certain instances share based compensation and retention incentives  attractive benefits and rewarding careers 
we periodically review and adjust  if needed  our consultants total compensation including salaries  annual cash incentive compensation  other cash and equity incentives  and benefits to ensure that it is competitive within the industry and is consistent with our performance 
in addition to compensation  we promote numerous charitable  philanthropic  and social awareness programs that not only support our community  but also provide rewarding experiences for our employees outside of their client activities 
we regularly evaluate consultant resource levels and utilization against future demand expectations and historical trends 
from time to time  we may reduce or add resources in certain areas in an effort to align with changing demands 
in connection with these changing demands  we also utilize project employees and engage independent contractors to supplement our full time consultants on certain engagements 
we find that retaining independent contractors on a per engagement basis from time to time allows us to quickly adjust staffing in response to changes in demand for our services without incurring up front recruiting costs of increasing our full time employee base 
in connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions  our general policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and some mid level consultants 
most of these covenants have restrictions that extend months or more beyond the termination of employment 
we utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to reduce the risk of attrition and to provide stability to our existing clients  staff and projects 
our bill rates or fees charged to clients are tiered in accordance with the experience and levels of our consultants 
we monitor and adjust those bill rates or fees according to then current market conditions for our service offerings and within the various industries we serve 
industry sectors we provide services to and focus on industries undergoing substantial regulatory or structural change 
our service offerings are relevant to most industries including federal and state agencies within the public sector 
however  we have significant industry specific knowledge and a large client base in the legal  energy  healthcare and financial services industries 
competition the market for consulting services is highly competitive  highly fragmented and subject to rapid change 
the market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including general management and information technology consulting firms  as well as global accounting firms  and other local  regional  national and international consulting firms 
many of these companies are international in scope and have larger teams of personnel  financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
in particular  the big four accounting firms  pwc  deloitte  ernst young and kpmg  are highly competitive in the consulting industry 
however  we believe that our experience  reputation  industry focus and broad range of service offerings enable us to compete effectively in the consulting marketplace 
developing client relationships we market our services directly to corporate counsel  law firms  governmental agencies  corporate boards  corporate executives and special committees 
we use a variety of business development and marketing channels to communicate directly with current and prospective clients  including on site presentations  industry seminars  and industry specific articles 
in addition  we have strengthened our market presence by developing our brand name 
new engagements are sought and won by our senior and mid level consultants working together with our business development team that supports all of our business segments 
we seek to leverage our client relationships in one business segment to cross sell service offerings provided by the other business segments 
clients frequently expand the scope of engagements during delivery to include follow on  complementary services 
our future performance will continue to depend upon our ability to win new engagements  retain consultants  develop and continue client relationships and maintain our reputation 
financial information about business segments we believe our unique mix of deep industry expertise  combined with our scale  broad geographic presence  multi disciplinary professionals and targeted service offerings position us to serve the majority of our clients challenges 
we continue to establish programs to facilitate collaborative product development and marketing efforts  and also to develop new  innovative and repeatable solutions for our clients

the remaining assets are unallocated 
allocated assets by segment were as follows shown in thousands december  december  disputes  investigations economics financial  risk compliance advisory healthcare energy unallocated assets total assets how our income is derived we derive our revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services 
a majority of our revenues are generated under hourly or daily rates billed on a time and materials basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenues recognized as the services are provided 
there are also client engagements for which we are paid a fixed amount for our services  often referred to as fixed fee billings  the vast majority of our healthcare operating segment utilizes fixed fee billing arrangements 
this may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions of the engagement 
from time to time  we earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
we also recognize revenues from business referral fees or commissions on certain contractual outcomes 
in addition  our technology  data process businesses also generate revenue on a per unit or subscription basis 
the performance based and referral related revenues we earn may cause unusual variations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations 
our most significant expense is labor costs  which consists of consultant salaries  incentive compensation  amortization of sign on and retention incentive payments  share based compensation and benefits 
labor costs are reported in cost of services before reimbursable expenses  which also includes sales and marketing expenses and the direct costs of recruiting and training consultants 
our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits and office related expenses 
administrative compensation includes salaries  incentive compensation  share based compensation and benefits for corporate management and administrative personnel that indirectly support client engagements 
office related expenses primarily consist of rent for our offices 
other overhead costs include bad debt expense  marketing  technology  finance and human capital management 
concentration of revenues revenues earned from our top clients amounted to  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase over the past two years related primarily to a concentration of larger mortgage servicing review and financial service dispute engagements in our financial  risk compliance advisory and disputes  investigations economics segments 
revenues earned from our top clients amounted to  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
no single client accounted for more than of our total revenues for any of the years ended december   and the mix of our largest clients may change from year to year 
non us operations we have offices in the united kingdom  canada  china  dubai and other countries outside the us and conduct business in several other countries 
the united kingdom accounted for of our total revenues for the year ended december  and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and no country  other than the united states and the united kingdom  accounted for more than of our total revenues in any of the three years ended december   and our non us subsidiaries  in the aggregate  represented approximately  or million  of our total revenues in compared to  or million  in and  or million  in available information we maintain a corporate website at www

item a 
risk factors in addition to other information contained in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference herein  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us and our business 
these factors could have a significant impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
risks related to the market our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by disruptions in the marketplace caused by economic and political conditions 
global economic and political conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve 
a severe and or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels and types of business activity engaged in by our clients and the industries we serve 
clients could determine that discretionary projects are no longer viable or that new projects are not advisable 
this may reduce demand for our services  depress pricing for our services or render certain of our services obsolete  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in global economic conditions or the regulatory or legislative landscape could also shift demand to services that we do not offer or for which we do not have competitive advantages  and this could negatively affect the amount of new business that we are able to obtain 
although we have implemented ongoing cost management measures  if we are unable to appropriately manage costs or if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions  we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes  and our business could be adversely affected 
additionally  significant economic turmoil or financial market disruptions could adversely impact the availability of financing to our clients and in turn may adversely impact our ability to collect amounts due from our clients or cause them to terminate their contracts with us  each of which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our business could be impacted by competition and regulatory and legislative changes 
the market for consulting services is highly competitive  highly fragmented  and subject to rapid change 
the market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including general management and information technology consulting firms  as well as the global accounting firms and other local  regional  national  and international consulting firms 
many of these firms are international in scope and have larger teams of personnel and financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
some firms may have lower overhead and other operating costs and  therefore  may be able to more effectively compete through lower cost service offerings 
many of our clients operate in highly regulated industries such as healthcare  energy  financial services and insurance 
regulatory and legislative changes in these industries potentially render certain of our service offerings obsolete and decrease our competitive position 
if we cannot compete effectively  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
our inability to successfully recruit and retain senior level consultants will affect our ability to win new engagements and compete effectively 
we rely heavily on a group of senior level consultants  and we believe our future success is dependent on our ability to retain their services 
competition for skilled consultants is intense  and compensation and retention related issues are a continuing challenge 
the consulting industry has low barriers to entry making it easy for consultants to start their own business or work independently 
in addition  it is relatively easy for consultants to change employers 
further  limitations on available shares under our equity compensation plans or a sustained decline in our stock price could also impair our ability to offer share based compensation as incentives to our senior level consultants 
our inability to attract  retain and motivate our senior level consultants could have an adverse effect on our ability to win new client engagements or meet client needs in our current engagements  and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
further  our failure to realize the expected financial returns from our recruiting investments could adversely impact our results of operations 
our international operations create special risks 
we have offices in the united kingdom  canada  china  dubai and other countries outside of the us and conduct business in several other countries 
we expect to continue to expand globally and our international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future 
our international operations carry special financial  business and legal risks  including cultural and language differences  employment laws and related factors that could result in lower utilization  higher staffing costs  and cyclical fluctuations of utilization and revenues  currency fluctuations that adversely affect our financial position and operating results  differing regulatory requirements and other barriers to conducting business  impact on consulting spend from international firms and global economies impacted by the european sovereign debt crisis and related government and economic response  managing the risks associated with engagements performed by employees and independent contractors with foreign officials and governmental agencies  including the risks arising from the anti bribery and corruption  greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations  including in high risk geographies  successful entry and execution in new markets  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  and potentially adverse tax consequences  such as net operating loss carry forwards that cannot be realized 
if we are not able to successfully mitigate the special risks associated with our international operations  our business prospects and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
risks related to capital and financing we cannot be assured that we will have access to sufficient sources of capital to meet our working capital needs or the future needs of our business 
in may  we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the credit agreement provides us a five year million revolving credit facility  which may be increased to million at our option  subject to the terms and conditions specified in the credit agreement 
we use the credit facility to assist in funding our short term working capital and long term cash requirements 
at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
there can be no assurance that the credit facility will continue to be sufficient to meet the future needs of our business  particularly if a decline in our financial performance occurs 
if this occurs  and we are unable to otherwise increase our operating cash flows or raise additional capital or obtain other debt financing  we may be unable to meet our future working capital needs  including  for example  consummating acquisitions 
furthermore  if our clients financial condition were to deteriorate  impairing their ability to make payments due to us  our operating cash flows would be adversely impacted which could require us to fund a greater portion of our working capital needs with borrowings under our credit facility 
lastly  certain financial institutions that are lenders under our credit facility could be adversely impacted by a depressed economy and therefore unable to meet their commitments under our credit facility  which in turn would reduce the amounts available to us under that facility 
our failure to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
our credit agreement contains financial covenants requiring that we maintain  among other things  certain levels of interest and debt coverage 
poor financial performance could cause us to be in default of these covenants 
while we were in compliance with these covenants at december   there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance in the future 
our borrowings under the credit facility tend to be higher during the first half of the year to fund annual incentive payments  and as a result  our consolidated leverage ratio is expected to increase from december  levels 
if we fail to comply with the covenants in our credit agreement  this could result in our having to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders to avoid the termination of their commitments and or the acceleration of the maturity of outstanding amounts under the credit facility 
the cost of our obtaining an amendment or waiver could be significant  and further  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain an amendment or waiver 
if our lenders were unwilling to enter into an amendment or provide a waiver  all amounts outstanding under our credit facility would become immediately due and payable 
we have variable rate indebtedness which subjects us to interest rate risk and may cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly 
borrowings under our credit facility are based on short term variable rates of interest which expose us to interest rate risk 
while market interest rates have remained low for some time  these rates could increase  adversely impacting our interest expense and cash outflows 
risks related to our business operations our revenues and profitability may suffer if we are not able to maintain current bill rates and or utilization rates 
our revenues  and in turn our profitability  are largely based on the bill rates charged to our clients and the number of hours our consultants work on client engagements  which we define as the utilization of our consultants 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the bill rates for our services or appropriate utilization rates of our consultants  our revenues  profit margins and profitability may suffer 
bill rates and consultant utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to predict future demand for our services and maintain the appropriate staffing levels without significant underutilized consulting personnel  our ability to transition consultants from completed projects to new client engagements  our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services  our competitors pricing of services  the market demand for our services  our ability to manage our human capital resources  our ability to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces as we increase the number of our consultants and execute our growth strategies  and the economic  political and regulatory environment as noted above 
additionally  the profitability of our fixed fee client engagements may not meet our expectations if we underestimate the cost of these engagements 
some of the work we do involves greater risk than ordinary consulting engagements 
we do work for clients that for financial  legal or other reasons may present higher than normal risks 
while we attempt to identify and mitigate our exposure with respect to higher risk engagements and higher risk clients  these efforts may be ineffective and an actual or alleged error or omission on our part or the part of our client or other third parties in one or more of these higher risk engagements could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 
examples of higher risk engagements include  but are not limited to interim management engagements  including those for hospitals and other healthcare providers  engagements where we assist clients in complying with healthcare related regulatory requirements  including clinical documentation improvement training and auditing services  revenue cycle and operational performance improvement services  billing services  medical record coding and auditing services  strategic consulting for hospital and health system merger and affiliation  and independent review organization assignments  corporate restructuring engagements  both inside and outside bankruptcy proceedings  engagements where we deliver a fairness opinion  engagements where we deliver project management services for large construction projects  engagements where we receive or process sensitive data  including personal consumer or private health information  engagements where we deliver a compliance effectiveness opinion  and engagements involving independent consultants reports in support of financings 
our inability to attract business from new or existing clients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
many of our client engagement agreements are short term in nature less than one year or can be terminated by our clients with little or no notice and without penalty 
for example  in our litigation related engagements  if the litigation is settled  our services usually are no longer necessary and our engagement is promptly terminated 
some of our services involve multiple engagements or stages 
in those engagements  there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for the additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements 
our client engagements are usually relatively short term in comparison to our office related expenses and other infrastructure commitments 
therefore  we rely heavily on our senior level consultant s ability to develop new business opportunities for our services 
in the past  we have derived significant revenues from events as inherently unpredictable as the california energy crisis  the sarbanes oxley act of  healthcare reform  the credit crisis and significant natural disasters including major hurricanes and earthquakes 
those events  in addition to being unpredictable  often have impacts that decline over time as clients adjust to and compensate for the challenges they face 
these factors also limit our ability to predict future revenues and make corresponding adjustments to our consulting staffing levels  which in turn could adversely impact our results of operations 
unsuccessful client engagements could result in damage to our professional reputation or legal liability which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our professional reputation and that of our consultants is critical to our ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract and retain employees 
any factors that damage our professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our client engagements subject us to the risk of legal liability 
any public assertion or litigation alleging that our services were deficient or that we breached any of our obligations to a client could expose us to significant legal liabilities  distract our management and damage our reputation 
our professional liability insurance may not cover every type of claim or liability that could potentially arise from our client engagements 
in addition  the limits of our insurance coverage may not be enough to cover a particular claim or a group of claims and the costs of defense 
we encounter professional conflicts of interest 
if we are unable to accept new client engagements for any reason  including business and legal conflicts  our consultants may become underutilized or discontented  which may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations  as well as our ability to retain these consultants 
in addition  although we have systems and procedures to identify potential conflicts of interest prior to accepting a new client engagement  there is no guarantee that all potential conflicts of interest will be identified  and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our reputation and result in professional liability which may adversely impact our business and results of operations 
we may be exposed to potential risks if we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls 
if we fail to achieve and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or fail to implement necessary new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes  we may fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis  and may be unable to adequately or accurately report on our business and our results of operations 
even with adequate internal controls  we may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud 
also  internal controls that are currently adequate may in the future become inadequate because of changes in conditions  and the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate 
this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
acquired businesses may not achieve expected results which could adversely affect our financial performance 
we have grown our business  in part  through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
the substantial majority of the purchase price we pay for acquired businesses is related to goodwill and intangible assets 
we may not be able to realize the value of those assets or otherwise realize anticipated synergies unless we are able to effectively integrate the businesses we acquire 
we face multiple challenges in integrating acquired businesses and their personnel  including differences in corporate cultures and management styles  retention of personnel  conflict issues with clients  and the need to divert managerial resources that would otherwise be dedicated to our current businesses 
additionally  certain senior level consultants  as sellers of the acquired businesses  are bound by non competition covenants that expire after a specific amount of time from the date of acquisition 
when these covenants expire  our ability to retain these senior level consultants could significantly impact the acquired businesses 
any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and retain personnel could cause the acquired businesses to fail to achieve their expected results  which would in turn  adversely affect our financial performance and may require a possible impairment of the acquired assets 
additionally  the financing of acquisitions through cash  borrowings or common stock could also impair our liquidity or cause significant stock dilution 
goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets  and an impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because we have acquired a significant number of businesses  goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to perform an annual impairment test at the reporting unit level on our goodwill and  on a quarterly basis  we are required to assess the recoverability of both our goodwill and long lived intangible assets 
we consider our operating segments to be our reporting units 
we may need to perform an impairment test more frequently if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  attrition of key personnel  a prolonged decline in our stock price and market capitalization  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of one of our businesses  and other factors 
if the fair market value of one of our reporting units or other long lived intangible assets is less than the carrying amount of the related assets  we could be required to record an impairment charge in the future 
the valuation of our reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and other factors 
in making these judgments  we evaluate the financial health of our reporting units  including such factors as market performance  changes in our client base and projected growth rates 
because these factors are ever changing  due to market and general business conditions  we cannot predict whether  and to what extent  our goodwill and long lived intangible assets may be impaired in future periods 
at december   we had goodwill of million and net intangible assets of million 
the amount of any future impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
see note goodwill and intangible assets  net to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we are subject to unpredictable risks of litigation 
although we seek to avoid litigation whenever possible  from time to time we are party to various lawsuits and claims 
disputes may arise  for example  from client engagements  employment issues  regulatory actions  business acquisitions  real estate and other commercial transactions 
there can be no assurances that any lawsuits or claims will be immaterial in the future 
our work with governmental clients has inherent risks related to the governmental contracting process 
we work for various us  state  local and foreign governmental entities and agencies 
these engagements have special risks that include  but are not limited to  the following governmental agencies generally reserve the right to audit our contract costs  including allocated indirect costs  and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices with respect to governmental contracts 
if the governmental entity finds that the costs are not reimbursable  then we will not be allowed to bill for them or the cost must be refunded to the governmental entity if it has already been paid to us 
findings from an audit also may result in our being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for work which would affect our future profit margins 
if a governmental client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of its audits or investigations  we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government 
governmental contracts  and the proceedings surrounding them  are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other commercial contracts 
negative publicity related to our governmental contracts  regardless of whether it is accurate  may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 
the impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only our relationship with the particular governmental agency involved  but also other agencies of the same or other governmental entities 
depending on the size of the engagement or the magnitude of the potential costs  penalties or negative publicity involved  any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
risks related to technology we have invested in specialized technology and other intellectual property for which we may fail to fully recover our investment or which may become obsolete 
we have invested in developing specialized technology and intellectual property  including proprietary systems  processes and methodologies  that we believe provide us a competitive advantage in serving our current clients and winning new engagements 
many of our service offerings rely on specialized technology or intellectual property that is subject to rapid change  and to the extent that this technology and intellectual property is rendered obsolete and of no further use to us or our clients  our ability to continue offering these services  and grow our revenues  could be adversely affected

overview we are an independent specialty consulting firm that combines deep industry knowledge with broad technical expertise 
we focus on industries that typically undergo substantial regulatory or structural change and provide services to enable clients to manage the uncertainty  risk and distress caused by those changes 
the nature of our services  as well as our clients demand for our services are impacted not only by these regulatory and structural changes  but also by the united states  global economies and other significant events specific to our clients 
our clients demand for our services ultimately drives our revenues and expenses 
we derive our revenues from fees on services provided 
the majority of our revenues are generated on a time and materials basis  though we also have engagements where fees are a fixed amount either in total or for a period of time 
from time to time  we may also earn incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fees  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
we also recognize revenues from business referral fees or commissions on certain contractual outcomes 
these performance based and referral revenues may cause unusual variations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations 
revenue is also earned on a per unit or subscription basis 
regardless of the terms of our fee arrangements  our ability to earn those fees is reliant on deploying consultants with the experience and expertise to deliver services 
our most significant expense is consultant compensation  which includes salaries  incentive compensation  amortization of sign on and retention incentive payments  share based compensation and benefits 
consultant compensation is included in cost of services before reimbursable expenses  in addition to sales and marketing expenses and the direct costs of recruiting and training consultants 
our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits and office related expenses 
administrative compensation includes salaries  incentive compensation  share based compensation and benefits for corporate management and administrative personnel that indirectly support client engagements 
office related expenses primarily consist of rent for our offices 
other administrative costs include bad debt expense  marketing  technology  finance and human capital management 
because our ability to derive fees is largely reliant on the hiring and retention of personnel  the average number of full time equivalents fte and our ability to keep consultants utilized are important drivers of the business 
the average number of fte is adjusted for part time status and takes into account hiring and attrition which occurred during the reporting period 
our average utilization rate as defined below provides a benchmark for how well we are managing our ftes in response to changing demand 
while hiring and retention of personnel is key to driving revenues  fte levels and related consultant compensation in excess of demand drive additional costs that can negatively impact margin 
from time to time  we hire independent contractors to supplement our consultants on certain engagements  which allows us to adjust staffing in response to changes in demand for our services  and manage our costs accordingly 
in connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions  our general policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and some mid level consultants 
most of these covenants have restrictions that extend months beyond the termination of employment 
we utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to reduce the risk of attrition and to safeguard our existing clients  staff and projects 
in addition to managing the number of employees and utilization of consultants  we also continually review and adjust our consultants total compensation including salaries  annual cash incentive compensation  other cash and share based compensation  and benefits to ensure that it is competitive within the industry and is consistent with our performance 
we also monitor and adjust our bill rates according to then current market conditions for our service offerings and within the various industries we serve 
additional information about our operations is included in the preceding business section 
acquisitions for details of our acquisitions see note acquisitions to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
key operating metrics we include the following metrics in order to provide additional operating information related to our business and reporting segments 
these key operating metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics at other companies 
during the three months ended june   in connection with our segment realignment see note segment information to the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we revised the definition of our technology businesses 
our technology  data process businesses are comprised of technology enabled professional services  including e discovery services and data analytics  technology solutions and data services  invoice and insurance claims processing  market research and benchmarking businesses 
prior period operating metrics have been revised to reflect all changes made to the following definitions 
average fte is our average headcount during the reporting period adjusted for part time status 
average fte is further split between the following categories client service fte combination of consulting fte and technology  data process fte defined as follows consulting fte individuals assigned to client services who record time to client engagements  technology  data process fte individuals in businesses primarily dedicated to maintaining and delivering the services described above and are not included in average bill rate and average utilization metrics described below  non billable fte individuals assigned to administrative and support functions  including office services  corporate functions and certain practice support functions 
period end fte represents our headcount at the last day of the reporting period adjusted for part time status 
consulting  technology  data process and non billable criteria also apply to period end fte 
average bill rate is calculated by dividing fee revenues before certain adjustments such as discounts and markups  by the number of hours associated with the fee revenues 
fee revenues and hours billed on performance based services and related to technology  data process fte are excluded from average bill rate 
as discussed above  changes in our definition of our technology  data process businesses resulted in changes to previously reported average bill rate 
average utilization rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of our consulting fte who recorded time to client engagements during a period  by the total available working hours for these consultants during the same period  hours annually 
as discussed above  changes in our definition of our technology  data process businesses resulted in changes to previously reported average utilization 
billable hours are the number of hours our consulting fte recorded time to client engagements during the reporting period 
segment operating profit represents total revenues less costs of services excluding long term compensation expense attributable to consultants 
long term compensation expense related to consultants includes share based compensation expense and compensation expense attributable to retention incentives 
all fte  utilization and average bill rate metric data provided in this report excludes the impact of independent contractors and project employees 
results of operations revenue before reimbursements growth was driven by contributions across all our segments  but primarily by our healthcare segment and by mortgage servicing review engagements in our financial  risk compliance advisory segment  also aided by significant growth in our technology  data process service offerings that span our segments 
the growth in our financial  risk compliance advisory segment was driven by several large mortgage servicing review engagements  partially off set by declines in other services 
settlements were recently announced between certain clients and the federal regulators which we expect to have a significant negative impact on our segment revenues 
the market trends driving our healthcare growth are expected to continue  and be aided by the complementary services added by our strategic acquisitions 
we believe the breadth and depth of our service offerings to the provider  payer  physician and life sciences market make us unique among consulting firms  which we expect to drive performance 
our energy segment finished the year strong  with nearly all of its growth driven by fourth quarter results 
our leading energy efficiency services drive that growth  now aided by the addition of our market research capabilities 
we anticipate that the outcome of the november elections will strengthen demand  assuming continued regulatory focus on energy efficiency  renewables and environmental issues 
in our disputes  investigations economics segment  we experienced continued challenges in our litigation support businesses throughout  with signs of improvements in the fourth quarter increased revenues from our technology  data process services within this segment helped to offset decreased revenue in our core disputes businesses

revenues before reimbursements in our disputes  investigations economics segment remained virtually flat for the year ended december  compared to as significantly higher technology revenues were largely offset by weaker general litigation and forensic accounting revenues 
including the impact of our acquisitions on a pro forma basis  revenues before reimbursements increased for the year ended december  compared to  mainly due to large engagements in the mortgage servicing review area and program changes relating to the us healthcare landscape 
as noted above  settlements were recently announced between certain clients and the federal regulators which will negatively impact our revenues relating to mortgage servicing reviews 
revenues before reimbursements included performance based fees of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease was mainly a result of fewer restructuring related performance based fees within our financial  risk compliance advisory segment 
utilization levels for the year ended december  ran at  down from a utilization rate in the decrease in utilization was offset by an increase in contractor and project employee resources  whose billable hours contributed to the revenues before reimbursements increase but were not captured in our utilization metric 
average bill rate was relatively flat at for the year ended december  compared to in average fte consulting also remained flat as staffing reductions within the disputes  investigations economics segment were offset by increases across the remaining segments due to new hires and acquisitions 
average fte technology  data process increased to support continued growth relating to technology solutions and financial services litigation related technology engagements within our disputes  investigations economics segment  claims and billing and technology solutions engagements within our healthcare segment  and our acquisition of pike research within our energy segment 
cost of services before reimbursable expenses 
cost of services before reimbursable expenses increased for the year ended december  compared to the increased cost of services was mainly due to higher wages and benefits associated with both increased fte client service and project based staffing levels 
in addition  medical expenses increased 
higher training  practice development and information technology costs also contributed to the increase 
severance expense for the year ended december  compared to was million and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by lower performance based incentives mainly driven by our lower restructuring related performance based fees 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by for the year ended december  compared to the increase was driven by increased wages and benefits and other operating costs primarily relating to employee development  communications and information technology 
in addition  average general and administrative fte increased for the year ended december  compared to these increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense  which decreased or million for the year ended december  compared to our days sales outstanding at december  improved to days from at december  due to strong fourth quarter collections

depreciation expense 
the increase in depreciation expense of for the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to recent technology infrastructure spending

other operating costs contingent acquisition liability adjustment

the related businesses exceeded their original performance expectations 
other operating costs office consolidation 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million expense relating to closing an office location acquired with our afe purchase 
the expense is an estimate which includes assumptions of expected sublease income 
interest expense

our effective income tax rate was for the years ended december  and the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance requires management judgment and could impact our financial results and effective tax rate 
results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues before reimbursements 
revenues before reimbursements increased by in compared to the increase was primarily due to improvements driven by strength in the financial  risk compliance advisory and healthcare segments as well as increases in the energy segment 
incremental revenue from our acquisitions  an increase in performance based fees and increased senior hiring contributed to the improved performance 
including the impact of our acquisitions on a pro forma basis  revenues before reimbursements would have increased approximately 
revenues before reimbursements included performance based fees of million and million  for the years ended and  respectively

consultant utilization improved to from in  while average billable fte s increased to  compared to  in average bill rate was for  up from in cost of services before reimbursable expenses 
cost of services before reimbursable expenses increased in compared to the increased cost of services was mainly due to higher performance based incentive compensation  wages and benefits increasing with headcount and  overall  solid revenue growth and improvement in our operating results 
in addition  amortization of certain recruiting incentives  retention and performance based incentives were higher in mainly due to and senior level hires 
these increases were partially offset by lower client service severance expense which was million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in compared to consistent with our improved financial performance  higher incentive compensation expense  along with increased information technology costs and additional costs related to acquisitions  drove most of the increase and was partially offset by lower bad debt expense  which decreased from average general and administrative fte s were up while supporting additional client service fte s 
bad debt expense decreases resulted from the improved collection of our accounts receivable

other operating costs benefit office consolidation

as a result  we reversed million of the accrual for future rent obligation and recorded a benefit to other operating costs 
in addition  we recorded additional costs of million to increase our reserves for future rent obligations for one of our abandoned chicago office spaces as a result of continued weak sublease market conditions 
other operating costs benefit intangible assets impairment 
during  we recorded an intangible assets impairment charge of million related to customer lists and relationships and non compete agreements in two markets within our disputes  investigations economics and financial  risk compliance advisory segment 
depreciation expense 
the decrease in depreciation expense of for compared to was primarily due to the full depreciation of certain assets and relatively lower spending on property and equipment in recent years 
amortization expense 
amortization decreased by million  or in compared to this was due to reduced amortization associated with certain intangible assets within our disputes  investigations economics segment which were subject to an impairment charge recorded during the three months ended december  in addition  certain intangible assets became fully amortized as their useful lives came to term 
this decrease was partially offset by increased amortization relating to our recent acquisitions

the timing of revenues varies from quarter to quarter due to various factors  including the ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalty  attaining certain contractual objectives  the size and scope of assignments  and general economic conditions 
because a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the number of client assignments  or the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments  can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
operating results are also impacted by other operating costs 
in addition  interest expense and interest income fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of balance changes in cash and debt 
liquidity and capital resources our cash flow activities were as follows shown in thousands for the years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities generally  our net cash provided by operating activities is used to fund our day to day operating activities  augmented by borrowings under our credit facility 
first quarter operating cash requirements are generally higher due to payment of our annual incentive bonuses while subsequent quarters net cash from operations are expected to be positive 
during the year ended december   we continued with our share repurchase program initiated in the fourth quarter of  increased growth related capital expenditures to support our expanding technology  data process businesses and invested in key talent retention 
our cash equivalents are primarily limited to money market accounts or a rated securities  with maturity dates of days or less 
we calculate accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso by dividing the accounts receivable balance  net of reserves and deferred revenue credits  at the end of the quarter  by daily net revenues 
daily net revenues are calculated by taking quarterly net revenues divided by days  approximately equal to the number of days in a quarter 
calculated as such  dso was days at december   compared to days at december  and days at december  a change in engagement mix in  specifically a greater portion of non litigation based work  contributed to the decline 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
higher net income and non cash compensation expense were more than offset by higher incentive bonus payments for the performance year paid in and higher accounts receivable 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was due to lower working capital requirements  higher revenue and improved collections 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
higher payments for acquisitions in and higher capital expenditures as we invest in our technology infrastructure and higher furniture and fixture spending relating to new office space in washington  d 
c were partially offset by lower deferred acquisition liability payments in cash used in investing activities was lower in compared to due to lower deferred acquisition payment obligations and lower capital spending on property and equipment in in  we acquired daylight and ethospartners 
for further information on our acquisitions see note acquisitions to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we announced the sale of a portion of our disputes  investigations economics segment see note subsequent events to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
net proceeds of approximately million were received in financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities in was primarily due to lower repayments  net of borrowings under our credit facility which was offset by higher share repurchases 
for the year ended december   we purchased  shares of our common stock in the open market for million 
also during the year ended december   million in contingent acquisition liabilities were paid relating to prior year acquisitions 
in  cash was used to pay down debt  purchase  shares of our common stock in the open market for million and pay million in financing fees for our new credit agreement 
in  excess cash was used to prepay million on our term loan facility 
we expect to increase our share repurchase plan in  compared to depending on business and market conditions 
debt  commitments and capital for further information regarding our debt see note bank debt to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   including the above mentioned credit facility  we had total contractual obligations of million 
the following table shows the components of our significant commitments at december  and the scheduled years of payments shown in thousands contractual obligations total to to thereafter deferred purchase price obligations cash purchase agreements revolving credit facility lease commitments we have commitments recorded in other current liabilities and other non current liabilities of approximately million reflected in table above relating to costs associated with an information technology infrastructure project that we commenced during the quarter ended december  to support our corporate technology needs in addition to the needs of our expanding technology business 
in addition  we have various contracts with information technology related vendors to support our enterprise reporting system which contain termination clauses allowing us to terminate the contracts for a penalty 
currently  we do not expect to terminate these contracts and expect to pay approximately million over the next two years through at december   we had million in liabilities relating to deferred acquisition liability obligations reflected in the table above 
of this balance  million is in the form of contingent acquisition liability obligations which was recorded at estimated fair value and discounted to present value 
settlement of the liabilities is contingent upon certain acquisitions meeting performance targets 
should each of these acquisitions reach their maximum target  our maximum payout would be million 
of the million lease commitments at december   million are related to offices we have abandoned or reduced excess space within  which have been subleased or are available for sublease 
at december   we had contractual subleases of million  which is not reflected in the commitment table above 
such sublease income would offset the cash outlays 
we may seek to exercise termination clauses  if any  to shorten the term of the lease commitments 
the lease commitments for these offices extend through on october   our board of directors extended until december  its previous authorization to repurchase up to million of our common stock in open market or private transactions 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares for million 
from inception of plan through december   we have repurchased  shares for approximately million 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  future cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will provide adequate liquidity to fund anticipated short term and long term operating activities 
however  in the event we make significant cash expenditures in the future for major acquisitions or other unanticipated activities  we may require more liquidity than is currently available to us under our credit facility and may need to raise additional funds through debt or equity financing  as appropriate 
in addition  if our lenders are not able to fund their commitments due to disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise  our liquidity could be negatively impacted 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues when evidence of an arrangement exists  the price of work is fixed or determinable  work is performed and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generate the majority of our revenues from providing services under the following types of billing arrangements time and material  fixed fee and transaction event based 
for our time and material billing arrangements  clients are invoiced based on the number of hours worked by our consultants at the contracted bill rates or units of service delivered  which are reviewed on a periodic basis 
revenue is recognized as work is performed on our time and material engagements 
additionally  revenue is recognized on our units of production engagements in a similar manner based on measures such as the number of items processed at agreed upon rates 
with our fixed fee billing engagements  we are contracted to complete a pre determined set of professional services for a pre determined fee 
however  the fee and engagement scope can be adjusted based on a mutual agreement between us and the client 
in many cases  the recording of fixed revenue amounts requires us to make an estimate of the total amount of work to be performed  and revenues are then recognized as efforts are expended based on i objectively determinable output measures  ii input measures if output measures are not reliable or iii the straight line method over the term of the arrangement 
in transaction or event based billing arrangements  fees are tied to the completion of contractually defined requirements 
in many cases  this contingent fee is earned in addition to an hourly or fixed fee  but is not recognized until certain milestones or objectives are met 
we also recognize revenue from business referral fees or commissions on certain contractual outcomes 
revenue recognized by transaction or event based billing arrangements may cause unusual variations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
in connection with recording revenues  estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenues to cash 
we may provide multiple services under the terms of an arrangement and are required to assess whether one or more units of accounting are present 
reimbursable expenses for our engagements include transportation  lodging  out of pocket and independent contractor costs 
such expenses are included in our revenue as applicable and are passed through to cost of services 
typically  reimbursable expenses are recognized as revenue during the period in which the expenses are incurred 
revenues recognized for services performed but not yet billed are recorded as unbilled receivables on our consolidated balance sheet 
advance payments and retainers are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as services are provided 
any taxes assessed on revenues relating to services provided to our clients are recorded on a net basis 
accounts receivable realization we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our review and assessment of our clients ability to make required payments  and the estimated realization  in cash  by us of amounts due from our clients 
if our clients financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
notes receivable and prepaid sign on and retention bonuses we grant and pay sign on and retention bonuses to attract and retain highly skilled consultants 
generally  we require grantees to sign incentive recovery agreements  which obligate the grantees to fulfill a service term  typically between one to five years 
if such service term is not fulfilled  the monetary equivalent of the uncompleted service term is required to be paid back to us 
we record paid sign on and retention bonuses to current and non current other assets and the bonuses are amortized as compensation expense over the service period as defined by the incentive recovery agreements 
certain sign on and retention bonuses of relatively low amounts are expensed to compensation expense when paid 
we also issue notes receivable in the form of unsecured employee loans with terms generally three to five years 
these loans were issued to recruit and retain highly skilled consultants 
the principal amount and accrued interest is either paid by the consultant or forgiven by us over the term of the loans  so long as the consultants continue employment and comply with certain contractual requirements 
the expense associated with the forgiveness of the principal amount of the loans and accrued interest is recorded as compensation expense over the service period  which is consistent with the term of the loans 
the accrued interest is calculated based on the loan s effective interest rate and is recorded as interest income 
business combinations we recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree as of the acquisition date at fair value 
fair value measurements require extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
in addition  we recognize and measure contingent consideration at fair value as of the acquisition date 
contingent consideration obligations that are classified as liabilities are remeasured at fair value each reporting period with the changes in fair value resulting from either the passage of time  revisions  or ultimate settlement to the amount or timing of the initial measurement recognized in income 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair value of the net assets acquired  which is accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting 
intangible assets consist of identifiable intangibles other than goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill include customer lists and relationships  employee non compete agreements  backlog revenue and trade names 
our long term assets are subject to changes in events or circumstances that could impact their carrying value 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually during the second quarter 
in addition to our annual goodwill test  on a periodic basis  we are required to consider whether it is more likely than not that the fair value has fallen below the carrying amount of an asset  thus requiring us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test 
we consider elements and other factors including  but not limited to adverse changes in the business climate in which we operate  attrition of key personnel  unanticipated competition  our market capitalization in excess of our book value  our recent operating performance  and or our financial projections 
the goodwill impairment test is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit  as defined by accounting standards codification asc  is an operating segment of a business one level below if discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management 
at december   we have four operating segments which are also considered to be our reporting units  as follows disputes  investigations economics  financial  risk compliance advisory  healthcare and energy 
on january   we adopted the principles prescribed in financial accounting standards board accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment which permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying a two step goodwill impairment test 
this step is referred to as step zero 
if an entity concludes that it is not likely that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we would not be required to perform a two step impairment test for that reporting unit 
the guidance lists certain factors to consider when making the qualitative assessment 
in the event that the conclusion requires the two step test  the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis income approach and a comparable company analysis market approach 
the second step is performed only if the carrying value exceeds the fair value determined in step one 
we determine the fair value of a reporting unit by using an equal weighting of estimated fair value using the income and market approach 
the income approach uses estimated future cash flows and terminal values 
assumptions used to determine future cash flows include forecasted growth rates  profit margins  longer term historical performance and cost of capital 
our assumptions are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
our internal projections and operating plans and thus our estimated fair value may be impacted by the overall economic environment 
our assumption may change as a result of  among other things changes in our estimated business future growth rate  profit margin  long term outlook  market valuations of comparable companies  the ability to retain key personnel  changes in operating segments  competitive environment and weighted average cost of capital 
under the market approach for determining fair value  we adopt certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation 
inputs to the valuation can be readily observable  market corroborated or unobservable 
wherever possible  we use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs  however  due to the use of our own assumptions about the inputs in measuring fair value  our goodwill impairment testing also makes use of significant unobservable inputs 
the fair value of our reporting units is also impacted by our overall market capitalization and may be impacted by volatility in our stock price and assumed control premium  among other things 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value determined in step one  step two is performed 
step two requires us to calculate the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
this is accomplished by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit as of the measurement date  similar to the purchase price allocation used when purchasing a new business 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities and deem the residual fair value of the reporting unit as the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
to the extent that the implied fair value of goodwill is below our carrying value  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied fair value 
the resulting impairment charge may be significantly higher than the difference between the carrying value and fair value determined in step one as a result of fair value assigned to other assets and liabilities in the hypothetical purchase price allocation completed in step two 
our annual goodwill impairment test was completed in the second quarter of and was completed based on our four reporting units 
at that time  as a result of our segment realignment  we did not perform step zero and completed the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its net asset carrying value 
accordingly  there was no indication of impairment and the second step was not performed 
intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized based on the period of consumption 
we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
further information regarding our goodwill balances and current year impairment testing and review can be found in note goodwill and intangible assets to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation we recognize the cost resulting from all share based compensation arrangements  including stock option  restricted stock and restricted stock units that we grant under our long term incentive plans in the financial statements based on their grant date fair value 
management judgment is required in order to i estimate the fair value of certain share based payments  ii determine the expected attribution period and iii assess expected future forfeitures 
additionally  certain performance based or market based awards are granted and vest based on the achievement of certain financial targets  or share price targets which requires us to estimate the probability of whether or not the targets will be achieved 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and a number of foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and results of recent operations 
when appropriate  we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance requires management judgment and could impact our financial results and effective tax rate 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted standards in september  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance which adds an optional qualitative assessment to goodwill impairment testing under asc the new guidance permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity concludes that it is not likely that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it would not be required to perform the two step impairment test for that reporting unit 
the guidance lists certain factors to consider when making the qualitative assessment 
the guidance is effective for annual or interim goodwill tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this guidance effective january  the adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance which requires public entities to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements 
under fasb asc topic presentation of comprehensive income  an entity has the option to present the components of net income and comprehensive income in either one or two financial statements 
this update eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity 
this update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  we adopted this guidance effective january  the adoption of this guidance impacted our presentations only 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
the interest rate risk is associated with borrowings under our credit facility and our investment portfolio  classified as cash equivalents 
the foreign currency risk is associated with our operations in foreign countries 
at december   borrowings under our credit facility bear interest  in general  based on a variable rate equal to an applicable base rate equal to the higher of a reference prime rate or one half of one percent above the federal funds rate or libor  in each case plus an applicable margin 
we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to the fluctuations in libor 
we use interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in libor 
at december   our interest rate swaps effectively fixed our libor base rate on million of our debt 
based on borrowings under the credit facility at december  and after giving effect to the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  our interest rate exposure is limited to million of debt  and each quarter point change in market interest rates would result in approximately a million change in annual interest expense 
at december   our cash equivalents were primarily limited to money market accounts or a rated securities  with maturity dates of days or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates rise 
because of the short periods to maturity of these instruments  an increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we operate in various foreign countries  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   we had net assets of approximately million with a functional currency of the uk pound sterling and million with a functional currency of the canadian dollar related to our operations in the united kingdom and canada  respectively 
at december   we had net assets denominated in the non functional currency of approximately million 
as such  a ten percent change in the value of the local currency would result in less than a million currency gain or loss in our results of operations 
excess cash held outside the united states is immaterial and therefore we have limited exposure to repatriating funds back to the united states
