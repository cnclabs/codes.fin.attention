investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview in  we continued to reposition the company to put our past troubles behind us and to put in place the proper management  employees and plans for future success 
the most significant event of for the company was our resolution of the investigations by the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of new york usao and by the securities and exchange commission 
in june   we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the usao 
in conjunction with the dpa  a criminal complaint was filed against the company 
the usao agreed  as part of the dpa  to defer prosecution of that complaint for eighteen months 
if we comply fully with the dpa  the charges will be dismissed at the conclusion of the eighteen month period 
among other things  the dpa requires us to continue to comply with various control changes we had made in response to the discovery that improper payments had been made to one customer by three former employees 
the dpa also mandates that we do not commit any criminal acts 
if we fail to comply with the dpa  the usao has the right to prosecute the complaint and to file additional charges if we have committed any new criminal acts 
in addition  we agreed to forfeit million 
we paid million during the third quarter of and we will pay the remaining million in december  we agreed with the sec to the entry of a consent judgment cj to settle a civil action filed by the sec 
pursuant to the cj  we agreed not to violate the anti fraud and registration provisions of sections a  a and c of the securities act of  and the books and records provisions of sections b a and b b of the securities exchange act of we further agreed to pay a civil penalty of million to the sec 
this fine was paid in full during the second quarter of the resolution of these investigations is a milestone for the company 
this should enable us to move on from the events of the past and concentrate on the company s future 
we will no longer be distracted by the substantial time and effort it took to complete the investigations 
we can now dedicate our resources both capital and human to efforts that we hope will positively impact our bottom line 
in addition  it reduces the potential of our competitors to raise concerns about the company s business conduct and long term viability 
they will again have to compete based on the merits of their products compared to ours 
this is a competition that we believe we are well positioned to win 
with regard to the company s reputation following these unfortunate events  we are proud that neither the dpa nor the settlement with the sec required us to institute any new controls 
rather  both the usao and the sec referenced the numerous new or enhanced controls that we previously implemented after the commencement of our internal investigation we believe that this is a validation of the path taken by company management 
the company  along with our former cfo  jim weber  and the estate of reijane huai  our former chairman and ceo  also remains a defendant in a class action lawsuit brought by stockholders the class action 
in january   we reached an agreement in principle to settle the class action for million and a stipulation and agreement of settlement was filed with the court on march  the class action is more fully described in part  item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k 
if the settlement is approved by the court  it should limit one more legacy distraction 
in connection with the class action and a derivative action lawsuit that was dismissed in march  we have been involved with discussions with the companies that provide our directors and officers insurance d o insurance coverage 
the d o insurance in place at the time that the two actions were commenced was divided into million layers  each written by a different insurer 
the d o insurance should provide us with recovery of fees spent defending the two actions and the costs of settlement or damages 
however  some of the insurers have raised questions with regard to the validity of the insurance agreements due to the presumed knowledge of wrongful acts by certain former company officers at the time the insurance was purchased 
in october  we reached a settlement with the insurer of the first million layer of our d o insurance pursuant to which the insurer agreed to pay us million in full satisfaction of its obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover any additional funds from the additional insurance companies 
even if we are able to recover under the additional layers of our d o insurance  we will still be responsible for the million gap between the recovery from the first insurer and the attachment point of the next million layer 

table of contents with regard to our business operations  in we focused on having the correct management team in place and refining our goals for our products going forward 
since september   we have hired new leadership in the following roles chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief technical officer  vice president sales marketing north america  vice president sales marketing emea  vice president sales marketing apac  and vice president of global support 
with this team in place  we reviewed our personnel  our products and our expenses 
among other decisions  we undertook a global reduction in force in july   that eliminated thirty five positions from our then existing headcount to better align our expense structure with our anticipated revenues 
our revenues are now primarily generated by our falconstor branded gateway appliances and complete turn key appliances with integrated disks  and licenses of our stand alone software products 
the appliances integrate our software with standard hardware configurations 
the integrated products were created in response to feedback we received from our resellers and the end users suggested that we could increase sales if we offered turn key appliances 
this has proven to be correct 
we are pleased that we have been able to absorb a cumulative decrease in total revenues from oems over the past three years of approximately million representing successive over annual declines 
overall  product revenues decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we attribute the decline in product revenues to four main factors 
first  we did not launch any new products in second  we had continued turnover in our sales force  particularly in north america  as our new sales leaders put their teams in place 
third  macroeconomic conditions around the world contributed to the overall softness in it spend 
last  sales from our legacy oems continued to decline 
our product revenues from falconstor branded solutions decreased over product revenues from oems declined from we do not expect to exit the oem business entirely 
oems can be valuable partners for us in a number of ways 
among these are allowing penetration of markets  both geographical and industry sector  where we do not have sufficient resources or history  providing feedback on product development and quality  and providing distribution channels for products that we may be de emphasizing in our falconstor branded product line 
we expect that an oem relationship in china will continue to be a source of revenue to the company 
support and services revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in the increase in support and services was primarily attributable to an increase in maintenance and technical support services 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  as discussed more fully below  included in our net loss for the year ended december  was an income tax provision of million compared with an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  we had stock based compensation expense which relates to stock options and restricted stock we grant to employees  officers and directors as part of our incentive compensation plan  and to some consultants as payment for services of million in and million in  which is reflected in the net results for each year 
typically  we look to operating income as another measure of our progress 
this number enables us to measure and to compare our results of operations from one year to the next 
operating loss for was million  compared with an operating loss of million in these numbers again include stock based compensation expense 
included in the operating loss is a million reduction of investigation  litigation and settlement related costs in compared to costs of million in related to investigation  litigation and settlement related costs 

table of contents we continued to work to decrease our operating expenses in besides watching our expenditures  we undertook a review of our workforce and made strategic reductions in our headcount that eliminated thirty five positions from our then existing headcount to better align our expense structure with our anticipated revenues 
overall our operating expenses decreased or million to million in from million in included in our operating results for both and was a reduction of million and costs of million  respectively  related to investigation  litigation and settlement related costs 
our gross margins were for as compared with in operating margin is a measure of operating efficiency 
we incur research and development expenses before the product is offered for licensing 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for engineering and testing  but also include other items such as the depreciation and amortization of hardware and software used in development 
we also have expenses for software support  sales and marketing  and general and administrative functions 
our operating margin increased to in from in the impact of investigation  litigation and settlement related costs on operating margin in was compared with in the key factors we look to for our future business prospects are our ability to establish and to expand relationships with resellers  and sales and re orders by those resellers  growth in deferred revenue  the development and sales of our new products  re orders from existing customers  and the growth of the overall market for data protection and storage solutions 
we anticipate that in product revenue by resellers and  to a lesser extent  direct licenses to end users  should grow 
we expect to see the results of our investments in new leadership and in our sales force and our marketing teams 
we also have instituted  and we will be instituting further  support  training and incentive programs intended to increase sales by resellers 
many enterprises look to value added resellers or solution providers to assist them in making their information technology purchases 
these resellers typically review an enterprise s needs and suggest a hardware  software  or combined hardware and software solution to fulfill the enterprise s requirements 
we continue to enhance our reseller program 
our business partner program for our resellers was rolled out in emea in we had previously instituted it in the americas and apac in this program provides enhanced sales collateral  training  and  in some cases  financial incentives  for our resellers 
as service providers to companies  resellers reputations are dependent on satisfying their customers needs efficiently and effectively 
resellers have wide choices in fulfilling their customers needs 
if resellers determine that a product they have been providing to their customers is not functioning as promised  or is not providing adequate return on investment  or if the customers are not satisfied with the level of support they are receiving from the suppliers  the resellers will move quickly to offer different solutions to their customers 
additional sales by resellers are therefore an important indicator of our business prospects 
in  we signed agreements with new resellers worldwide 
the type of resellers with whom we are signing agreements has continued to evolve 
while we still sign agreements with strong local and regional resellers  we have also entered into reseller agreements with national and multi national resellers who have their own distribution networks 
the enhanced distribution and marketing networks offered by these larger resellers should help us to continue to grow our sales 
we also terminated relationships with resellers who we believed were not selling our products at the levels we expected in we will continue to enter into relationships with resellers and to discontinue relationships with resellers with whom we are not satisfied 

table of contents our deferred revenues consist primarily of amounts attributable to future support and maintenance of our products 
the level of deferred revenue is an important indicator of our success 
maintenance and support for our products is sold for fixed periods of time 
maintenance and support agreements are typically for one year  although some agreements are for terms in excess of one year 
if we do not deliver the support needed by end users of our products or by our oem partners and resellers  then they will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
if end users stop using our products  they also will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
our deferred revenue decreased from to million in the main reason for the decline was a result of the phasing out of our products by our legacy oems over the past few years 
in addition  since our product sales declined as a result of the global economic conditions  we sold fewer new maintenance and support contracts 
we expect to continue to be affected by seasonality of the information technology business on a quarterly basis 
historically  information technology spending has been higher in the fourth and second quarters of each calendar year  and somewhat slower in the other quarters  particularly the first quarter 
we did not experience this typical seasonality in we believe that this was an aberration based on global economic conditions and the internal revamping our sales force 
we anticipate that our quarterly results for will show the effects of historical seasonality 
share based compensation expense continued to have a negative impact on our earnings in on an on going basis we weigh the impact of the expense on our consolidated financial statements against the impact of discontinuing the grant of equity based compensation to our worldwide workforce 
it continues to be our view that the opportunity to participate in the growth of our company is an important motivating factor for our current employees and a valuable recruiting tool for new employees 
we will thus continue to apply the criteria and the methodology we have used in the past to determine grants of stock options or other equity based compensation to our employees 
for the management of our business and the review of our progress  we will continue to look to our results excluding share based compensation expense 
we will use these non gaap financial measures in making operating decisions because they measure the results of our day to day operations and because they provide a more consistent basis for evaluating and comparing our results across different periods 
the primary risks to our success come from product development 
for more information on the risks we face  please see part i  item a  risk factors  of this filing 
we need to provide a continuing series of new products and improvements to existing products 
innovation in the data protection market is key to survival 
customers expect that data protection software will become both more capable and easier to manage over time 
if we are unable to deliver new  innovative products in a reasonable time frame  we will fall behind our competitors 
innovation requires adequate resources and the right people 
if we do not have enough resources or the right people  we will fall behind

we do not anticipate that any of our legacy oem partners will contribute over of our annual revenues for the foreseeable future 
during  we continued our focus and emphasis on the falconstor branded business 
as a result of overall macroeconomic conditions  we experienced significant competitive pricing practices from our competitors  customers delaying or postponing it spending and the overall uncertainty in the marketplace 
these factors have all contributed to the overall decrease in our non oem product revenues 
in addition  the recently concluded government investigation also contributed to the challenges and disruptions we faced in our business

the anticipated growth in our maintenance and technical support service revenue is expected to result primarily from i the purchase of maintenance and support contracts by our customers  and ii the renewal of maintenance and support contracts by our existing and new customers after their initial contracts expire 
during the year ended december   the growth in maintenance revenue in the non oem channel business was primarily offset by i a decline in maintenance revenue from certain legacy oem customers due to consolidation in the industry  ii the decrease from non oem product revenues during the current year  which are generally sold with maintenance  and iii deeper discounts provided on product in the current economic and competitive environment 
professional services revenues remained consistent at million for the years ended december  and december  the professional services revenue varies from period to period based upon i the number of solutions sold during the existing and previous periods  ii the number of our customers who elect to purchase professional services  and iii the number of professional services contracts that are performed during the period

critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  deferred income taxes  accounting for share based payments  goodwill and other intangible assets  software development costs  fair value measurements and litigation 
revenue recognition 
as discussed further in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements  we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on revenue recognition 
product revenue is recognized only when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the fee is fixed and determinable  among other criteria 
an arrangement is evidenced by a signed customer contract  a customer purchase order  and or a royalty report summarizing software licenses sold for each software license resold by an oem  distributor  or reseller to an end user 
product fees are fixed and determinable as our standard payment terms range from to days  depending on regional billing practices  and we have not provided any of our customers with extended payment terms 
when a customer purchases our integrated solutions and or licenses software together with the purchase of maintenance  we allocate a portion of the fee to maintenance based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the contractual optional maintenance renewal rate 
if professional services are included in our multi element software arrangements  we allocate a portion of the fee to these services based on its vsoe of fair value which is established using rates charged when sold on a stand alone basis 
accounts receivable 
we review accounts receivable to determine which receivables are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for uncollectible accounts and returns  we consider i historical return rates  ii specific past due accounts  iii analysis of our accounts receivable aging  iv customer payment terms  v historical collections  write offs and returns  vi changes in customer demand and relationships  vii actual cash collections on our accounts receivables and viii concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness 
when determining the appropriate allowance for uncollectable accounts and returns each period  the actual customer collections of outstanding account receivable balances impact the required allowance for returns 
we recorded total provision expenses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these amounts are included within our consolidated statement of operations in each respective year 
changes in the product return rates  credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs  revenues and our general and administrative expenses 
income taxes 
as discussed further in note income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on income taxes  we regularly evaluate our ability to recover deferred tax assets  and report such deferred tax assets at the amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in determining the period in which related tax benefits are realized for financial reporting purposes  excess share based compensation deductions included in net operating losses are realized after regular net operating losses are exhausted 

table of contents we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on income taxes  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return  should be recorded in the financial statements 
pursuant to the authoritative guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it meets the more likely than not threshold that the position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
in addition  the authoritative guidance addresses de recognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods  and also requires increased disclosures 
accounting for share based payments 
as discussed further in note share based payment arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements  we account for share based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on stock compensation 
we have used and expect to continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of share based compensation expense 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected option term and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of share based compensation expense reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
we estimate expected volatility based primarily on historical daily price changes of our stock and other factors 
the expected option term is the number of years that we estimate that the stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise 
the estimated expected term of the stock awards issued has been determined pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
additionally  we estimate forfeiture rates based primarily upon historical experience  adjusted when appropriate for known events or expected trends 
we may adjust share based compensation expense on a quarterly basis for changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of these events and trends and recognize the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization in the period in which we revised the forfeiture estimate 
if other assumptions or estimates had been used  the share based compensation expense that was recorded for the years ended december   and could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions or estimates are used in future periods  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as discussed further in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on goodwill and other intangibles 
the authoritative guidance requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite life 
absent any prior indicators of impairment  we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each of our fiscal years 
as of each of december  and  we had million of goodwill 
as of each of december  and  we had million net of accumulated amortization  of other identifiable intangible assets 
we do not amortize goodwill  but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often if a trigger event occurs 
we amortize identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step process based on an evaluation of the reporting unit 
the first step involves a comparison of a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
in the second step  if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we compare the goodwill s implied fair value and its carrying value 
if the goodwill s carrying value exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to such excess 
we evaluate the recoverability of other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in business climate  several periods of operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset a group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
as of december  and  we did not record any impairment charges on either our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 

table of contents software development costs 
as discussed further in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements  we account for software development costs in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of software development costs  net of amortization 
the authoritative guidance requires that the costs associated with the development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products be expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product has been established 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established and assumptions are used that reflect our best estimates 
if other assumptions had been used in the current period to estimate technological feasibility  the reported product development and enhancement expense could have been affected 
annual amortization of capitalized software costs is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product  generally estimated to be five years from the date the product became available for general release to customers 
software development costs are reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value 
net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross future revenues from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
because the development of projected net future revenues related to our software solutions used in our net realizable value computation is based on estimates  a significant reduction in our future revenues could impact the recovery of our capitalized software development costs 
we amortize software development costs using the straight line method 
fair value measurement 
as discussed further in note fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements  we determine fair value measurements of both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on fair value measurements and disclosures 
in the current market environment  the assessment of the fair value of our marketable securities  specifically our debt instruments  can be difficult and subjective 
the volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined  and the rapid changes occurring in the current financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time 
the fasb authoritative guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
level instruments represent quoted prices in active markets 
therefore  determining fair value for level instruments does not require significant management judgment  and the estimation is not difficult 
level instruments include observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets  issuer credit ratings  non binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data  model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities 
these level instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level instruments 
level instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
all of our marketable debt instruments classified as level are valued using an undiscounted cash flow analysis  a non binding market consensus price and or a non binding broker quote  all of which we corroborate with unobservable data 
non binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers 
these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs  including non binding and binding broker quotes  observable market prices for identical and or similar securities  and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs  and to a lesser degree non observable market inputs 
adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using non binding market consensus prices and non binding broker quotes  and classified as level  were not significant as of december  there were no instruments classified as level as of december  
table of contents other than temporary impairment after determining the fair value of our available for sale debt instruments  gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income  until either the investment is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary 
determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment 
for investments in debt instruments  these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer  the issuer s credit rating  and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full  and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity 
given the current market conditions  these judgments could prove to be wrong  and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations 
litigation 
as discussed further in note litigation  to our consolidated financial statements  in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on contingencies  the company accrues anticipated costs of settlement  damages and losses for claims to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable 
the company records a receivable for insurance recoveries when such amounts are probable and collectable 
in such cases  there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued 
if  at the time of evaluation  the loss contingency related to a litigation is not both probable and estimable  the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable and  the company will expense these costs as incurred 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  the company will accrue the minimum amount of the range
