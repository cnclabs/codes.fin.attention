table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a worldwide leader in the design  development  and manufacture of high performance process control defect inspection  advanced packaging lithography  metrology  and process control software systems used by microelectronics device manufacturers 
we provide process and yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems for macro defect inspection  lithography  probe card test and analysis  and transparent and opaque thin film measurements 
all rudolph systems feature sophisticated software and production worthy automation 
rudolph systems are backed by worldwide customer support 
in june  we announced that we had acquired specific assets and liabilities of nanophotonics gmbh  located in mainz  germany nanophotonics acquisition 
the acquired business has been integrated into our inspection technology group 
the impact of the acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  we announced that we had acquired azores corporation  located in wilmington  massachusetts azores acquisition 
the acquired business marks our entry into the advanced packaging and fpd lithography markets 
the impact of the acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we have made a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date for the nanophotonics and azores acquisitions 
we expect to finalize our analysis of the purchase price allocation within the first year of the acquisitions  and therefore adjustments to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets may occur 
rudolph s business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment 
the amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors  including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer  tablet  cell phone  other personal electronic devices and automotive sales 
current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry are similar year over year capital spending to down for our revenues and profitability  tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market 
we monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly published industry data such as the book to bill ratio 
the book to bill ratio is a month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments 
a book to bill ratio above shows that semiconductor device equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period 
the three month rolling average north american semiconductor equipment book to bill ratio was for the month of december  increasing from the september book to bill ratio of historically  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
for the years ended december   and  sales to customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for   and of our revenues  respectively 
in  sales to taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co 
and samsung semiconductor  inc accounted for and of our revenues  respectively 
in  sales to infineon technologies and samsung semiconductor inc accounted for and of our revenues  respectively 
in  sales to samsung semiconductor inc and advanced semiconductor engineering  inc 
accounted for and of our revenues  respectively 
we do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products  and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time 
a delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly 
in addition  during a given quarter  a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
our macro defect inspection and probe card and test analysis systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system  our transparent film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system  our opaque film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately million to million per system  and our lithography steppers range in average selling price from approximately million to million per system 

table of contents a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the united states 
we expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
the following table lists  for the periods indicated  the revenue derived from customers outside of the united states in percentages of total revenues years ended december  asia europe total international revenue the sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to months  and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology 
due to the length of these cycles  we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments

our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems  services  spare parts and software licensing 
our revenues were million  million and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
this represents a decrease of from to and a increase of from to the decrease in revenue from to is primarily due to customer deferring purchases during the second half of due to changes in demands for their products and uncertainty in the global economy 
the increase in revenue from  to is primarily due to increased capital spending by our back end customers in the semiconductor industry 

table of contents the following table lists  for the periods indicated  the different sources of our revenues in dollars thousands and as percentages of our total revenues year ended december  systems and software inspection metrology data analysis and review parts services total revenue total systems and software revenue decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to a slow down in system sales in the second half of as our customers deferred purchases due to changes in demands for their products and uncertainty in the global economy 
this contributed to decreases in the number of inspection and metrology systems sold year over year and reflects decreases in inspection systems revenue of million and metrology systems revenue of million 
the year over year increase in data analysis and review software revenues of million from to is primarily due to increased sales across all data analysis and review software product families 
the average selling price of similarly configured systems has been consistent and therefore did not have a material impact on our revenue for the same period 
systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to of total revenue for compared to of total revenue for the year over year increase in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from to is primarily due to increased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems 
parts and services revenues are generated from part sales  maintenance service contracts  system upgrades  as well as time and material billable service calls 
total systems and software revenue increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to an increase in demand for our products in advanced packaging 
this contributed to an increase in the number of inspection systems sold year over year and reflects an increase in inspection systems revenue of million 
the year over year decreases in metrology systems revenue of million and data analysis and review software revenues of million from to are primarily due to decreased sales across all metrology and data analysis and review software product families

systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to of total revenue for compared to of total revenue for the year over year decrease in parts and service revenues in absolute dollars from to is primarily due to decreased spending by our customers on repairs of existing systems as they purchased new systems 
parts and services revenues are generated from part sales  maintenance service contracts  system upgrades  as well as time and material billable service calls 
deferred revenues of million are recorded in other current liabilities at december  and primarily consist of million for deferred maintenance agreements and million for systems awaiting acceptance and outstanding deliverables 
gross profit 
our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies  excess and obsolete inventory write offs  pricing by competitors or suppliers  new product introductions  production volume  customization and reconfiguration of systems  international and domestic sales mix  and parts and service margins 
our gross profit was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to product mix  which included an increase in software sales 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to product mix  which included a decrease in software sales 
we do not track gross margin by the sources of revenue 

table of contents operating expenses the operating expenses consist of research and development 
the macro defect inspection  thin film transparent  opaque process control  and probe card test analysis market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations 
we believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements of existing products  including the transition to copper and low k dielectrics  wafer level packaging  the continuous shrinkage in critical dimensions  and the evolution of ultra thin gate process control  is critical to our success 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our technical  management and financial resources to research and development programs 
research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research  design and development activities 
they also include consulting fees  the cost of related supplies and legal costs to defend our patents 
our research and development expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year dollar increase from to was primarily due to higher compensation  increased patent litigation costs  as well as  the inclusion of a full year of engineering costs associated with an acquisition completed in the third quarter of the year over year dollar increase from to was primarily due to higher compensation and project costs  as well as  additional research and development costs for acquired businesses in we continue to maintain our commitment to investing in new product development and enhancement to existing products in order to position ourselves for future growth 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales  marketing  and general administrative personnel  as well as commissions and other non personnel related expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year increase from to in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily due to incremental higher compensation and corporate legal expenses 
this year over year decrease from to is primarily due to decreased corporate legal expenses  partially offset by increased compensation costs 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in amortization expense from to was due to a full year of amortization from assets derived from an acquisition completed in the third quarter of the increase in amortization expense from to was due to amortization from intangible assets from the nanophotonic acquisition in the second quarter of interest income expense 
in  net interest income was million 
in and  net interest expense was million and million  respectively 
the year over year increase in net interest expense for was primarily due to interest expense related to the convertible senior notes issued in the third quarter of the year over year increase in net interest expense for was primarily due to a full year of interest expense related to the convertible senior notes 
other income expense 
in and  net other expense was million and million  respectively 
in net other income was million 
the year over year dollar changes in net other income expense were primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
income taxes 
income tax expense was million in in and  we recorded income tax benefit of million and million  respectively 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million or of income before provision for income taxes 
this differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of  primarily as a result of projected tax payments in us and foreign locations  offset by valuation allowances 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million or of income before provision for income taxes 
the income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of  primarily as a result of reversal of valuation allowances  partially offset by projected tax payments in us and foreign locations 

table of contents income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million or of income before provision for income taxes 
the income tax benefit differs from the federal statutory income tax rate of  primarily as a result of reversal of valuation allowances  partially offset by projected tax expense in us and foreign locations 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred tax assets from future taxable income and establish valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
we consider available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
at december  and  we had valuation allowances of million and million on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax asset at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the decrease in valuation allowance of million is primarily due to a release of the tax valuation allowance 
we evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax asset based on positive earnings from through as well as the projected earnings in future years and believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset and evaluate the valuation allowance 
the american taxpayer relief act of was passed by congress and signed into law in january 
the provisions under this law were made retroactive to january  however  as a result of the law being signed in january  the financial impact of any retroactive provision will be recorded as a discrete event in the first quarter of we estimate that this discrete event will reduce tax expense in the first quarter of by approximately million for research and development tax credits for litigation 
as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings  we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  which includes  among other things  our on going litigation with itc in which we are in the process of appealing an order of the us district court in a patent infringement action related to the predictive scrub feature of our precisionpoint  precisionworx and probeworx products in which we were the defendants 
see part  item for a discussion of this action and the district court adverse order affirming the jury award and ordering other relief in this matter 
we have appealed the order and damages assessment 
in the event that the ultimate decision in the itc litigation results in a judgment of damages against us at the high end of the identified ranges  such result will have a material impact on the our results of operations and may also have a material impact on our liquidity and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million  while working capital amounted to million 
at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in working capital 
typically during periods of revenue growth  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers 
similarly  during periods of declining revenue  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected 
net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income  adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges  of million  an increase in accrued liabilities of million  a decrease in income tax receivable of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million  and increase in other current liabilities of million  partially offset by an increase of accounts receivable of million and an increase of inventories of million

capital expenditures over the next twelve months are expected to be approximately million to million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in the period  net cash provided by financing activities comprised proceeds received from sales of shares through share based compensation plans of million and tax benefit from share based compensation plans of million 
in the period  net cash provided by financing activities comprised net proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes of million  proceeds from the sale of a warrant of million  tax benefit from employee stock plans of million and proceeds received for sales of shares through share based compensation plans of million  partially offset by the purchase of the convertible note hedge of million 
in the period  net cash provided by financing activities comprised proceeds received from sales of shares through share based compensation plans of million and tax benefit from share based compensation plans of million 
from time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses  products and or technologies 
we may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash  stock  or a combination of cash and stock 
in july  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of company common stock with no established end date 
as of the time of filing this annual report on form k  we have not purchased any shares under this program 
on july   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes  which mature on july  and pay interest semiannually commencing on january  in connection with the issuance  we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
the convertible note hedge transaction is intended to reduce potential dilution in our common stock upon conversion of the notes 
however  the warrant transaction will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrant 
net proceeds realized from the sale of the convertible senior notes  the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions were million 
we continue to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  which may include financing potential acquisitions and strategic transactions  growth initiatives and working capital 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions  which will affect our ability to generate additional cash 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements  we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings  sales of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately million at december  we are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods when cash settlement of this liability may occur

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  business acquisitions  intangible assets  share based payments  income taxes and warranty obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue recognition generally results at the following points for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment  revenue is recognized upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment  the portion of revenue associated with certain installation related tasks is deferred  and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation related tasks  for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment  revenue is recognized at customer technical acceptance  for transactions which have occurred prior to january   revenue for arrangements with multiple elements  such as sales of products that include software and services  was allocated to each element using the residual method based on the fair value of the undelivered items as determined using the prior guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements  for transactions occurring on or after january  containing multiple elements  the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or estimated sales prices esp until delivery of the deferred elements 
third party evidence is not typically used to determine selling prices as to limited availability of reliable competitor products selling prices 
the esp is established considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  gross margin objectives  internal costs and competitor pricing strategies 

table of contents revenues from parts sales are recognized at the time of shipment 
revenue from training and service contracts is recognized ratably over the training period and contract period 
a provision for the estimated cost of fulfilling warranty obligations is recorded at the time the related revenue is recognized 
revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vsoe exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
license support and maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if our assumptions are otherwise incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we maintain reserves for our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those originally projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
business acquisitions 
we account for acquired or merged businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition or merger at their respective fair values 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
accordingly  for significant acquisitions  we typically obtain assistance from independent valuation specialists 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for intangible assets  we typically utilize the income method 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows including timing and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment 
for example  different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
all of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
goodwill 
our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is october st or prior to the next annual testing date if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
under the amendments of asc  asu no 
 testing goodwill for impairment  beginning in the first quarter of  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  we elect this option and after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is not likely that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
we have not elected this option to date 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of our aggregated reporting unit using the market value of our common stock at october st  multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares market capitalization and an implied control premium as if it were to be acquired by a single stockholder 
we obtain information on completed sales of similar companies in a comparable industry to estimate an implied control premium for us 
we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodwill 
if the results of the initial market capitalization test produce results which are below the reporting unit carrying value  we will also consider if the market capitalization is temporarily low and  if so  we may also perform a discounted cash flow test 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
this determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of 
table of contents goodwill which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
long lived assets and acquired intangible assets 
we periodically review long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses  such as future cash flows and disposition costs  may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and the impairment of such long lived assets  if any  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
no such indicators were noted in share based compensation 
the fair value of our stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our share grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the need for a valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
at december  and  we had valuation allowances of million and million on certain of our deferred tax assets to reflect the deferred tax asset at the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the decrease in valuation allowance of million is primarily due to a release of the tax valuation allowance 
we evaluated the realizability of the deferred tax asset based on positive earnings from and as well as the projected earnings in future years and believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future years 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of the deferred tax asset and evaluate the valuation allowance 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step requires us to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that the tax position has met the threshold for recognition  therefore  we must evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step requires us to measure the tax benefit of the tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized when effectively settled 
this measurement step is inherently difficult and requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate the uncertain tax positions each quarter based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 

table of contents although we believe the measurement of our liabilities for uncertain tax positions is reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  it could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the asu requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
this asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
we do not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
the asu is to simplify how entities  both public and non public  test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in the asu permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
this asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the asu is to improve the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to facilitate convergence of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the fasb decided to eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity  among other amendments in this asu 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
the asu is to defer only those changes in asu no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates and market liquidity including our investments in certain available for sale securities and our convertible senior notes 
our available for sale securities consist of fixed and variable rate income investments municipal notes  bonds and an auction rate security 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates  market liquidity and credit ratings of issuers from our available for sale securities 
it is possible that we are at risk if interest rates  market liquidity or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of december   an immediate adverse change of in interest rates eg to would result in an immaterial decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
the interest rate on our convertible senior notes is fixed 
therefore  any change in interest rates will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency risk we have branch operations in taiwan  singapore and south korea and wholly owned subsidiaries in europe  japan and china 
our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies 
these foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar relative to the reporting currencies of our foreign subsidiaries at december  would have affected the foreign currency denominated non operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries by approximately million 
we cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a substantial portion of our international systems sales are denominated in us dollars with the exception of japan and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales 
substantially all our sales in japan are denominated in japanese yen 
from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within months 
the change in fair value of the forward contracts is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations each reporting period 
as of december  and  we had twenty six and eight forward contracts outstanding  respectively 
the total notional contract value of these outstanding forward contracts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
