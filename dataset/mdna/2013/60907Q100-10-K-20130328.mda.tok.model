item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks and cautionary statement concerning forward looking statement 
the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on our behalf 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information available at the time these statements and disclosures were prepared 
this report includes and incorporates by reference forward looking statements within the meaning of the act 
these statements are included throughout this report  and in the documents incorporated by reference in this report  and relate to  among other things  projections of revenues  earnings  earnings per share  cash flows  capital expenditures  or other financial items  expectations regarding acquisitions  discussions of estimated future revenue enhancements  potential dispositions  and changes in interest rates 
these statements also relate to our business strategy  goals and expectations concerning our market position  future operations  margins  profitability  liquidity  and capital resources 
the words believe  anticipate  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  plan  predict  project  will  and similar terms and phrases identify forward looking statements in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference in this report 
although we believe the assumptions upon which these forward looking statements are based are reasonable  any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and the forward looking statements based on these assumptions could be incorrect 
our operations involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are outside of our control  and any one of which  or a combination of which  could materially affect our results of operations and whether the forward looking statements ultimately prove to be correct 
actual results and trends in the future may differ materially from those suggested or implied by the forward looking statements depending on a number of factors 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expected include the following changes in interest rates  changes in economic conditions in our market area  greater loan losses than anticipated  the effect on us and our industry of difficult market conditions  unprecedented volatility and the soundness of other financial institutions  the effect of legislative regulatory initiatives  our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry  the effect of our concentration in loans secured by real estate  the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  our ability to obtain additional capital in the future on terms that are favorable  other factors described under risk factors above 

table of contents because of these uncertainties  our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward looking statements 
in addition  our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results 
therefore  we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward looking information and statements 
we will not update the forward looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting the forward looking statements 
overview the purpose of this discussion is to provide information about the major components of our results of operations and financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to assist in the evaluation of our performance 
we generate a significant amount of our income from the net interest income earned by monarch bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
monarch bank s cost of money is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
we also generate income from non interest sources 
non interest income sources include bank related service charges  fee income from residential mortgage sales  fee income from title insurance  fee income from the sale of investment and insurance services  income from bank owned life insurance boli policies  as well as gains or losses from the sale of investment securities 
analysis of operating results net income our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  the bank and its subsidiaries  after all significant inter company transactions have been eliminated

diluted earnings per share were for december   and for december  two important and commonly used measures of profitability are return on assets net income as a percentage of average total assets and return on stockholders equity net income as a percentage of average stockholders equity 
our returns on average assets were and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the returns on average stockholders equity were and for the same time periods 
net income for the year ended december  was  an increase of compared to this growth was attributable to both net interest income and non interest income 
net income available to common stockholders  which is net of preferred stock dividends of  in and  in  was  at december   compared to  in net interest income increased million or to million in compared to earning asset growth coupled with lower cost liabilities were the source of this increase 
loans held for sale increased million and loans held for investment grew million  year over year 
average outstanding loans held for sale increased million and average loans held for investment increased million 
the combined yield on these loans declined basis points 

table of contents interest bearing deposits increased million  year over year  and average outstanding interest bearing deposits increased million 
the overall costs associated with deposits declined basis points 
total borrowings increased million  year over year  while average outstanding borrowings only increased million  and the cost of borrowing declined basis points 
non interest income increased million to million in our primary source of non interest income is mortgage banking income  which increased million  or for a total of million 
our mortgage division  operating under the name of monarch mortgage delivered record production in other non interest income increased thousand in compared to included in other non interest income in were non recurring net proceeds from bank owned life insurance boli totaling thousand 
non interest expense increased million to million in  compared to million in salaries and benefits  commissions and loan expense represent million  or of this increase  which was related primarily to mortgage production 
our provision for loan losses was million in  million  or less than our provision of million 
at the same time net charge offs were million  a decrease in net charge offs of million or compared to million one year prior 
our allowance for future losses increased thousand in through use of the provision  management seeks to provide for future losses inherent in the existing portfolio 
this is achieved by utilizing various metrics including but not limited to  loss history  economic conditions and industry trends 
provision and allowance management requires a great deal of judgment and is a primary focus of our team 
the net effect on pre tax and pre non controlling interest income was an increase of  or  to  compared to  in net interest income net interest income  which is the excess of interest income over interest expense  is a significant source of revenue 
net interest income is influenced by a number of factors  including the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rates earned on earning assets and the interest rates paid to obtain funding to support the assets 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  this represents an increase of or  over when net interest income was  rates  though stable  have remained at historically low levels over the past four years 
although in recent months the economy has shown measured signs of recovery  we have been at  or near  the bottom of an economic downturn that began in the later months of for much of that time 
at the time the federal reserve open market committee fomc  which sets the federal funds rate  began to decrease the federal funds target 
it did this in an effort to stabilize the economy and head off a recession 
between september and december the fomc decreased the target funds rate a total of basis points which resulted in the current  historically low  federal funds rate of 
during this same period  wall street journal prime wsjp  which moves in tandem with the federal funds target rate  has held at 
repeated comments by the fomc indicate that they intend to maintain this low rate environment until  at least  mid in addition to setting the target funds rate  the fomc utilizes other tools to shape monetary policy 
it uses the federal funds rate to manage short term interest  but it can also influence long term rates 
over the past few years  through the systematic purchase of longer term treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities  the fomc has kept the money supply flowing and long term interest rates artificially low  in an effort to encourage banks to lend and businesses to borrow 
as the fomc escalated its purchases in long term mortgage backed securities in  it had a significant impact on the long term mortgage market in the form of a refinance boom 
during we continued reshaping our balance sheet in preparation for future increases in rates 
our focus has been on building non maturity core deposits to support our loans held for investment portfolio 
a portion of these deposits also support a base level of our loans held for sale portfolio 
we define core deposits as non brokered  in market deposits 
demand deposits grew million  or  million of this growth was in non interest bearing demand 
money market accounts grew million  or in we also utilized short term non core brokered funds and borrowings at the federal home loan bank fhlb to meet the volume demands of our loans held for sale portfolio  which increased dramatically in response to the long term strategies of the fomc 
as stated previously  historically low mortgage rates lead to high refinance production 
in addition purchase money production was also strong 
typically  loans held for sale remain in our portfolio an average of days before being delivered to our investors 
however  in the third quarter of the high volume of refinance business coupled with increased purchase 
table of contents money volume led to a slowdown in investor processing  which pushed this average to days 
due to the sheer volume of mortgages being processed  investors began pushing back or delaying the purchase of loans  even though their commitments were in place 
therefore growth in our loans held for sale portfolio was a function of both production levels and timing 
at december  our loans held for sale had increased million  or to million over year end on average  our loans held for sale portfolio increased million  or to million 
interest income from our loans held for sale increased million  or in to million 
during we continued our loans held for investment strategy of supporting our existing client base  promoting disciplined growth with regard to new clients  and promoting short term fixed rate loan pricing where possible 
however  many borrowers were still reluctant to enter the market  despite low rates 
this led to heavy competition in both rate and term for high quality loans 
our outstanding loans held for investment increased million or to million in however  interest income from loans held for investment only increased thousand or to million 
total interest income was  in compared to  in earning asset yield declined basis points to in compared to in the prior year 
loan yield is the result of both the interest rate and any fees collected on a loan 
interest and fees on loans are the largest component of our interest income 
interest and fees on loans held for investment decreased basis points in to a blended yield of compared to in the yield on our loans held for sale  which is driven by fomc monetary policy  declined basis points in to  compared to in volume fluctuations coupled with the changes in yield discussed previously have resulted in decreases in the combined loan portfolios of basis points to in from in the yield on our securities portfolio increased basis points from in to in during  million of the million in outstanding securities at december  either matured or were subject to rate call 
securities totaling million were purchased in the year over year increase in yield is related to one low yielding non callable agency security in at the instrument level  the overall yield of our outstanding securities portfolio at december  is lower than year end our restricted stock and deposits in other banks yield increased basis points or thousand in we have restricted stock with fhlb  the federal reserve and community bankers bank which earn dividends 
in  fhlb paid thousand in dividends compared to thousand in  due to internal restrictions they had in place in the yield on our bank owned life insurance boli declined basis points to in compared to in total interest expense declined  or to  for the year ended december   compared to interest cost declined basis points from in to in interest bearing deposits  the largest component of interest expense  declined basis points  from in to in during the year  we adjusted the pricing of our products  while remaining market competitive 
the rate on our money market accounts declined basis points to  while our blended time deposit or certificate of deposit cd rate declined basis points to 
our borrowing cost decreased basis points in to 
this decline is due to a higher level of low cost borrowing relative to total borrowing 
we have a loan for million with fhlb that bears a rate of 
in  we borrowed less on average  so this relatively high rate had a greater impact on yield 
in we secured a million holding company line of credit from pnc bank with a variable rate of month london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points 
in addition  we continued to borrow from fhlb under our lines 
at december  the borrowings on our fhlb line totaled million  or million higher than december  however  our average borrowings at fhlb were million 
as stated previously  we utilize our line to help fund our loans held for sale portfolio 
additional analysis with regard to interest income will reference the following tables 
for discussion purposes  our net interest income analysis and our changes in net interest income rate volume analysis tables are adjusted to include tax equivalent income on boli and tax exempt municipal securities that is not in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the following table is a reconciliation of our income statement presentation to these tables

the difference between rates earned on interest earning assets with an adjustment made to tax exempt income to provide comparability with taxable income  ie the fte adjustment and the cost of the supporting funds is measured by the net interest margin

the goal of a rate volume analysis is to compare two or more earning periods to determine whether the difference between the results of those periods is due to changes 
table of contents in rate  or volume  or some combination of the two 
this is achieved through a what if analysis 
we calculate what the potential income would have been in the new period if the prior period rate had remained unchanged  and compare that result to what the potential income would have been in the prior period if the current rates were in effect 
through the analysis of these income potentials  we are able to determine how much of the dollar change between periods is due to the impact of differing rates and how much is volume driven 
net interest income has been adjusted to include income from boli and the tax effect of tax exempt municipal securities 
our net interest income in increased million when compared to  million of this increase was due to changes in volume and thousand was due to changes in rates 
earning asset growth provided million due to volume driven earnings  million of which was absorbed by increased volume in liabilities 
changes in rates had almost no impact as savings in liability costs of million were offset by reduced earning asset potential of million 
growth  net of changes in interest rates on our loans held for sale portfolio  contributed an additional million to income 
commercial loan growth net of reduced interest rates  in our loans held for investment portfolio provided an additional thousand  while the remaining loan categories showed lower combined earnings of thousand due to lower yield 
the remaining earning assets on our balance sheet reduced our earnings a combined thousand 
a decrease in interest rates on liabilities contributed an additional million to net interest income in  but growth in our cds and other borrowings absorbed million of that savings 
interest bearing deposits  which are the primary source of interest expense  grew an average of million in  million of which was in average cds outstanding at a potential cost of million which was offset by a million savings potential due to rate reductions

table of contents market risk management we spend a great deal of time focusing on the management of the balance sheet to maximize net interest income 
our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility  and our primary objectives for managing interest rate volatility are to identify opportunities to maximize net interest income while ensuring adequate liquidity and carefully managing interest rate risk 
the asset liability management committee alco  which is composed of executive officers  is responsible for monitoring corporate financial performance  meeting liquidity requirements  establishing interest rate parameters  indices  and terms for loan and deposit products  assessing and evaluating the competitive rate environment  monitoring and measuring interest rate risk  reporting our performance results to our board 
interest rate risk refers to the exposure of our earnings and market value of portfolio equity mve to changes in interest rates 
the magnitude of the change in earnings and mve resulting from interest rate changes is impacted by the time remaining to maturity on fixed rate obligations  the contractual ability to adjust rates prior to maturity  competition  and the general level of interest rates and customer actions 
there are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on our earnings and capital 
repricing risk arises largely from timing differences in the pricing of assets and liabilities 
reinvestment risk refers to the reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower or higher rates 
basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not all affected equally 
yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full range of maturities 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  alco reviews the changes in net interest income and mve given various changes in interest rates 
we also consider the most likely interest rate scenarios  local economics  liquidity needs  business strategies  and other factors in determining the appropriate levels of interest rate risk 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  simulation analysis is used to determine the impact on net interest income and mve from changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the amount of assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice through specified periods if there are no changes in balance sheet mix 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis in table reflects our assets and liabilities on december  that will either be repriced in accordance with market rates  mature or are estimated to mature early or prepay within the periods indicated 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of our position at any other time 
interest bearing demand deposits and money market balances are considered interest sensitive for of the outstanding balances 
management believes this structure makes for a more accurate and meaningful view of our interest sensitivity position

this is due the volume in our loans held for sale portfolio 
although we remain asset sensitive beyond three months to five years  the level of sensitivity is greatly diminished 
as stated previously  this is a model of a one day position 
because of their limited term before being delivered to investors  loans held for sale are treated as though it were a single duration asset  as opposed to a constantly renewing asset 
other borrowings also reflect maturities based upon funding loans held for sale 
table a has been modified  extracting loans held for sale from assets and the related borrowings of million from liabilities 
this modification would result in a neutral position with regard to short term interest rates sensitivity 
we believe our balance sheet is well positioned with regard to interest rate sensitivity and future rate changes when they occur

simulation analysis is used to subject the current repricing conditions to rising interest rates in increments of   and and falling interest rates in decrements of and to determine how net interest income changes for the next twelve and twenty four months  with flat growth  under two rate assumptions 
the assumptions are shocked  in a scenario that assumes the entire rate change has occurred in a single month  and ramped  in a scenario that assumes rate changes have occurred equally throughout the analysis period 
alco also applies a shocked and ramped assumption when measuring the effects of changes in interest rates over a twelve month period on mve by discounting future cash flows of interest bearing deposits and loans using new rates at which deposits and loans would be made to similar depositors and borrowers 
market value changes in the investment portfolio are estimated by discounting future cash flows and using duration analysis 
loan and investment security prepayments are estimated using current market information 
tables and a show the estimated impact of changes in interest rates up   and and down and  on net interest income and on mve as of december  in thousands 
change in net interest income shocked assumption results the projected change in net interest income due to changes in interest rates in the twelve month projection at december   were in compliance with our internally established guidelines for increases of  and  and decreases of 
in the twenty four month projection  the degree of change in net interest income due to changes in interest rates were in compliance with our established internal guidelines for increases of and decreases of 
decreases in interest rates of and increases of were non compliant under both projected time periods and increases of and were non compliant for twenty four months 
the internal guidelines are set by management and approved by our board 
these guidelines have been established to assist the company in monitoring potential sensitivity to interest rate risk  but a non 
table of contents compliant result is not an indication of excessive risk 
it is merely an indicator that closer monitoring by management may be necessary 
ramped assumption results the projected change in net interest income due to changes in interest rates in the twelve month projection at december   were in compliance with our established internal guidelines at all rate increments except decreases of 
in the twenty four month projection  the degree of change in net interest income due to changes in interest rates were in compliance with our established internal guidelines for increases of and decreases of  but all other changes in interest income were non compliant 
our loans held for sale portfolio creates challenges when modeling net interest income due to the underlying flat growth assumption 
the model assumes that as rates move up or down the volume in our loans held for sale would remain constant  thereby  yielding income that is above policy limits when rates increase and below policy limits when rates decline 
history has demonstrated that loans held for sale behave in a completely different manner 
when rates decrease volume goes up and will compensate to some level for the impact of the rate decrease 
conversely  when rates increase so will the volume and income will decline as a result 
market value of equity under both the shocked and ramped assumptions changes in the market value of equity for increases of    and were in compliance with our established internal guidelines 
however for decreases of both and the results were not within our internal guidelines 
these projected changes in the mve model are based on flat growth assumptions and no changes in the mix of assets or liabilities 
both the modified interest rate sensitivity model and the simulation model indicate that we are well positioned for potential rate shifts 
these models support the actions that management has taken with regard to the length of maturities in our portfolio and the products we offer 
we will continue to analyze our portfolio and modify our actions as needed to support company growth in the future

at december   we employed a total of full and part time employees compared to at year end in addition  higher compensation related benefits such as social security tax and medicare tax expenses have contributed to the increase 
loan expense continues to grow as a function of costs associated with underwriting and processing mortgage loans at our current volume 
additionally  expense related to the shipping of mortgage loan packages to secondary market investors has had an impact on postage 
the telephone is a critical communication tool for the banking industry as a whole and our mortgage lenders in particular 
our bank and mortgage lenders spend a great deal of time out of the office meeting with clients and prospects 
this expense has grown with our banking and mortgage operations 
we launched our mbpw division in with the opening of an office in williamsburg and newport news 
we also opened our suffolk office in our mortgage operations continue to expand to new markets as well 
these additions and improvements have contributed to the increases in both occupancy and furniture and equipment expense in monarch has continued to focus on marketing our company brand and gaining exposure in the communities we serve through advertising  community activities and sponsorships

our review process is supported by a series of reports related to loan production  loan quality  credit concentrations  policy exceptions  loan delinquencies and non performing and potential problem loans 
we also utilize diversification in our loan portfolio as a means of managing risk 
our allowance for loan losses is to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management is responsible for determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  subject to review by our board of directors 
among other factors  we consider on a monthly basis our historical loss experience  the size and composition of our loan portfolio  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  non performing credits including impaired loans  our risk rating based loan watch list  and local and national economic conditions 
the economy of our trade area is well diversified 
there are additional risks of future loan losses that cannot be precisely quantified or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
since those factors include general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses is an estimate 
to determine the total allowance for loan losses  we estimate the reserves needed for each segment of the portfolio  including loans analyzed on both  a pooled basis and individually 
our allowance for loan losses consists of amounts applicable to the following loan types i the commercial loan portfolio  ii the real estate loan portfolio  iii the consumer loan portfolio 
in addition  loans within these portfolios are evaluated as a group or on an individual or relationship basis and assigned a risk grade based on the underlying characteristics 
loans are pooled by risk grade within the portfolio types  and losses are modeled utilizing metrics such as the risk rating  historical experience  other known and inherent risks  and quantitative techniques which management has determined fit the characteristics of that type 
the commercial loan portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans which are usually secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and normally incorporate a personal guarantee  however  some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis 
commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business 

table of contents the real estate loan portfolio includes all loans secured by real estate 
this type is further broken down into the following segments construction loans  residential family loans  home equity lines  multifamily loans  and commercial real estate loans 
construction and multifamily loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies  independent appraisal reviews  sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners 
construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project 
residential family and home equity loan originations utilize analytics to supplement the underwriting process 
commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans  in addition to those of real estate loans 
these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate 
commercial and real estate portfolio loans are evaluated on an individual or relationship basis and assigned a risk grade at the time the loan is made 
additionally  we perform periodic reviews of the loan or relationship to determine if there have been any changes in the original underwriting which would change the risk grade and or impact the borrower s ability to repay the loan 
the consumer loan portfolio includes consumer and installment loans and overdraft protection loans 
these loans  which are in relatively small loan amounts  are spread across many individual borrowers 
we utilize analytics to supplement general underwriting 
loans within the consumer class are assigned risk grades and evaluated as a pool  unless specifically identified through delinquency or other signs of credit deterioration  at which time the identified loan is individually evaluated 
additionally  loans that have been specifically identified as a credit risk due to circumstances that may affect the ability of the borrower to repay interest and or principal are analyzed on an individual basis 
adverse circumstances may include loss of repayment source  deterioration in the estimated value of collateral  elevated trends of delinquencies  and charge offs 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses monthly in order to maintain the allowance at a level that is sufficient to absorb probable credit losses 
such factors as the level and trend of interest rates and the condition of the national and local economies are also considered 
from time to time  events or economic factors may affect the loan portfolio  causing management to provide additional amounts to or release balances from the allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses is sensitive to risk ratings assigned to individually evaluated loans  economic assumptions  and delinquency trends driving statistically modeled reserves 
there are nine numerical risk grades that can be assigned to loans pass watch list minimal special mention modest substandard average doubtful acceptable loss acceptable with care

at december  we did not have any loans risk graded as a loss or as doubtful 
we do not have any potential problem loans which have not been evaluated and disclosed at december  loans identified as special mention and substandard may or may not be classified as nonaccrual  based on current performance 
watch list loans are evaluated on an individual or relationship basis to determine if any  or all  of our loans to the borrower are at risk 
we evaluate the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
for additional discussion on this evaluation refer to note and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
this evaluation includes  but is not limited to  the application of a loss factor using a three year moving average look back at our historical losses 
this loss factor is multiplied by the outstanding principal within each segment to arrive at an overall loss estimate 
environmental factors may also be applied to a segment or segments of loans based on management s subjective evaluation of such conditions as credit quality trends  collateral values  portfolio concentrations  specific industry conditions in the regional economy  regulatory examination results  external audit and loan review findings  recent loss experiences in particular portfolio classes  etc 
any unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s 
table of contents attempt to ensure that the overall reserve appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of credit losses 
the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy 
this examination may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies 
in  we expensed  in provision for loan losses compared to  in based on the current economic environment and the composition of our loan portfolio  the level of our charged off loans combined with our peer bank loss experience  we considered this provision to be a prudent allocation of funds for our loan loss allowance

the allowance is increased by the provision for losses and by recoveries from losses 
charged off loan balances are subtracted from the allowance 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined on a monthly basis 
various factors as defined in the previous section allowance and provision for loan losses are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status after they are past due for days 
non performing loans include loans on which interest is no longer accrued  accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more as to principal and interest payments  and loans classified as troubled debt restructurings  and these are detailed in table total non performing loans as a percentage of total loans were and at december  and december   respectively

deposits provide funding for our investment in loans and securities 
our primary objective is to increase core deposits as a means to fund asset growth at a lower cost 
interest paid for deposits must be managed carefully to control the level of interest expense

demand deposit products are an area of focus due to their low cost 
in  we participated in the federal deposit insurance transaction account guarantee program  which provided that through december  our clients received unlimited coverage for balances in both their non interest bearing and low interest bearing deposit accounts 
this program expired december   but provisions of the dodd frank act provided separate unlimited coverage for non interest bearing demand and interest on lawyer trust accounts ioltas until december  this coverage expired december  non interest bearing demand deposits increased an average of million or in and an annual million or 
the majority of our non interest bearing demand accounts are commercial  small business and attorney escrow accounts 
commercial accounts have increased an average of million in the past year and small business checking has increased an average of million 
on an annual basis commercial accounts have increased million and small business accounts have increased million 
now accounts grew million on average and million year over year in although the majority of our now accounts are personal accounts  commercial now accounts increased million on average in to million 
year over year  commercial now accounts increased million 
the consistent trending between average and ending balances in our demand accounts indicates steady growth throughout the year 
monarch began focusing on growing low cost demand and now accounts several years ago 
this focus has taken the form of developing a well trained  dedicated cash management team with a goal of providing high quality service and cost effective products to our commercial and small business clients  thereby growing business deposits and also obtaining their personal banking accounts in the process 
on average  savings account balances were relatively flat in compared to while year over year growth was million 
this is a change from recent years in which there has been a declining trend in these balances 
savings accounts are typically utilized by individuals with limited savings capacity or with specific short term goals  looking for a place to set aside funds but who are not particularly interest rate sensitive 
money market accounts have increased an average million or and million or  on an annual basis in our money market portfolio consists of both core and non core accounts 
core money market accounts increased an average million  and million annually  in our core money market account is a multi tiered product offering better rates than savings accounts but at higher deposit levels 
it is a highly competitive product that offers more flexibility than time deposits with the benefit of rates comparable with short term time deposits 
non core money market account balances declined on average million in compared to  but grew million on an annual basis 
in the third quarter of we ended one of our two non core money market relationships which had a contractually high balance associated with it  and in we negotiated a new non core relationship with a lower contractual balance and interest rate

our off balance sheet transactions recognized as of december  were a letter of credit to secure public funds  commitments to extent credit and standby letters of credit 
our letter of credit to secure public funds was from the federal home loan bank  and was for million at december  and commitments to extend credit and unfunded commitments under existing lines of credit amounted to million at december  and million at december   which represent legally binding agreements to lend to clients with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being funded  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue guaranteeing the performance of a client to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements 
at december  and december   we had million and million respectively  in outstanding standby letters of credit 
we do not have any off balance sheet subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
there was no commitments to purchase securities at december  there was a commitment to purchase a tax exempt municipal security with an original face or  at a price of on december  this security settled january  we and our subsidiaries have thirty seven non cancellable leases for premises

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those applications of accounting principles or practices that require considerable judgment  estimation  or sensitivity analysis by management 
in the financial service industry  examples  though not an all inclusive list  of disclosures that may fall within this definition are the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of mortgage servicing rights  valuation of derivatives or securities without a readily determinable market value  and the valuation of the fair value of intangibles and goodwill 
except for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and fair value estimations related to foreclosed real estate  we do not believe there are other practices or policies that require significant sensitivity analysis  judgments  or estimations 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
our critical accounting policies are listed below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on gaap guidance which requires that losses be accrued when they have a probability of occurring and are estimable and that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has three basic components the formula allowance  the specific allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses along with various economic factors and  as a result  could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since this history is updated with the most recent loss information  the errors that might otherwise occur may be mitigated 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified loans 
historical loss information  expected cash flows and fair value of collateral are used to estimate these losses 
the unallocated allowance captures losses whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowance 
the use of these values is inherently subjective  and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
derivative financial instruments we use derivatives to manage risks related to interest rate movements 
interest rate swap contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported at fair value 
the gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge initially is included as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when interest on the related debt is paid 
we document our risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge 
our interest rate risk management strategy is to stabilize cash flow requirements by maintaining interest rate swap contracts to convert variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
periodically  we participate in a mandatory delivery program for mortgage loans 
under the mandatory delivery system  loans with interest rate locks are paired with the sale of a notional security bearing similar attributes 
interim income or loss on the pairing of the loans and securities is recorded in mortgage banking income on our income statement 
in addition  at the time the loan is delivered to an investor  matched securities are repurchased and a gain or loss on the pairing is recorded in mortgage banking income on our income statement 
management has elected to limit our exposure to this form of delivery to million in outstanding loans 
we were not participating in the mandatory delivery program at december  fair value measurements under gaap we are permitted to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the estimation of fair value is significant to certain assets  including loans held for sale  available for sale securities  and foreclosed real estate owned 
these assets are recorded at fair value or lower of cost or fair value  as applicable 
the fair values of loans held for sale are based on commitments from investors 
the fair values of available for sale securities are based on published market or dealer quotes for similar securities 
the fair values of rate lock commitments are based on net fees currently charged 
table of contents to enter into similar agreements 
the fair value of foreclosed real estate owned is estimated based on our evaluation of fair value of similar properties 
fair values can be volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  and market conditions  among others 
since these factors can change significantly and rapidly  fair values are difficult to predict and subject to material changes that could impact our financial condition and results of operation 
non gaap presentations our management s discussion and analysis refers to the efficiency ratio  which is computed by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non interest income 
this is a non gaap financial measure which we believe provides investors with important information regarding our operational efficiency 
comparison of our efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be possible because other companies may calculate the efficiency ratio differently 
in referring to our net income  we are referring to income under gaap 
the analysis of net interest income in this document is performed on a tax equivalent basis 
we feel the tax equivalent presentation better reflects total return  as many financial assets have specific tax advantages that modify their effective yields 
a reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income to net interest income under gaap is provided in those statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets 
due to this fact  the effects of inflation on our balance sheet are minimal  meaning that there are no substantial increases or decreases in net purchasing power over time 
the most significant effect of inflation is on other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
we feel that the most significant impact on financial results is changes in interest rates and our ability to react to those changes 
as discussed previously  management is attempting to measure  monitor and control interest rate risk 
impact of prospective accounting standards for discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to recent accounting pronouncements in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by our board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
our board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability management committee alco 
in this capacity  this committee develops guidelines and strategies that govern our asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with our financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of our earnings 
alco uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while this committee routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling and month horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the results of this simulation model are presented in tables and a included in item of this form k 
this model assumes flat growth and captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on our balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated four times each year 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum internal tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one and two year horizon given a   and basis point bp upward shift or a  or basis point downward shift in interest rates 
the model does simulations using two assumptions  a sudden or shocked one month parallel and pro rata shift in rates and a ramped parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month and month period for changes in net interest income and for months for market value of portfolio equity sensitivity 

table of contents all of the month period results in the net interest income simulation met the approved internal limits of our asset liability management policy with the exception of the downward shift of basis points in both the shocked and ramped assumptions and an upward shift of basis points in the shocked assumption 
only the upward shift of basis points and downward shift of basis points were within internal policy limits for either month model 
upward movements of  and basis points and downward movement of basis point were outside of internal policy limits 
the results of changes in market value of portfolio equity sensitivity indicate that downward shifts of basis points under both assumptions would yield results that were not within the approved internal policy limits 
we continue to focus its efforts on complying with approved limits 
the model assumes flat growth and is a snapshot approach that attempts to capture how the assets and liabilities that are on our balance sheet at a specific point in time  which in this case is december   would perform under changing rate scenarios 
this approach only focuses on management s decisions about the pricing  structure and duration of assets and liabilities to that point  filtering out the impact of future decisions 
it also ignores the natural behavior of one of our significant earning assets  loans held for sale  which would typically increase in a lower rate environment and decrease in a higher rate environment 
in spite of this flaw in the flat growth model the overall simulation is beneficial because it allows management to evaluate current strategies and determine if changes need to be made in the future with regard to those strategies 
the potential impact of rising rates on net interest income and equity is a primary concern for most members of the banking industry today  because rates have remained at historic lows long enough for the majority of assets and liabilities to re price to the low levels creating a potential for liability sensitivity 
borrowers want to lock in loan rates for a longer period when rates are low because it decreases their costs 
at the same time  depositors want to keep time deposits and similar savings products short so that they are not locked in to lower earnings when rates rise 
this combination  if allowed to occur would create liability sensitivity  resulting in margin compression when rates rise because rates on deposits and borrowings would increase at a faster pace than rates on loans and other earning assets 
monarch has attempted to balance the desires of our clients with the realities of positioning the bank for protection from margin compression in the future 
based on model results  monarch s balance sheet appears to be adequately positioned to avoid margin compression when rates begin to rise 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a bank forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  asset and liability growth  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flow 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on clients with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that our alco committee might take in response to or in anticipation of changes in interest rates
