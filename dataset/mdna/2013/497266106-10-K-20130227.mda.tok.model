the company transports petrochemicals  refined petroleum products  black oil products and agricultural chemicals by tank barge 
as of december   the company operated a fleet of inland tank barges  including leased barges  with million barrels of capacity  and operated an average of inland towboats during  of which an average of were chartered 
the company s coastal fleet consisted of tank barges  two of which are single hull and of which are chartered  with million barrels of capacity  and coastal tugboats  three of which were chartered 
the company also operates eight offshore barge and tug units  one of which is chartered  transporting dry bulk commodities in united states coastal trade 
through its diesel engine services segment the company provides after market services for medium speed and high speed diesel engines  reduction gears and ancillary products for marine and power generation applications  distributes and services high speed diesel engines and transmissions  pumps and compression products  and manufactures and remanufactures oilfield service equipment  including pressure pumping units  for the land based pressure pumping and oilfield service markets 
for  net earnings attributable to kirby were  or per share  on revenues of  compared with net earnings attributable to kirby of  or per share  on revenues of  the year included a  before taxes  or 
per share  credit to selling  general and administrative expense  resulting from a net decrease in the fair value of the contingent earnout liability associated with the april acquisition of united 
this compares with a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses increasing the fair value of the contingent earnout liability by  before taxes  or 
per share 
the year also included an estimated 
to 
per share negative impact from low water throughout the mississippi river system during the second  third and fourth quarters  net of certain revenue and cost recovery from contracts with terms that provide reimbursements for delays and increased costs  and the impact of hurricane isaac in the second quarter which made landfall near the mouth of the mississippi river on august  as a category storm  impacting both the marine transportation and diesel engine services segments  and hurricane sandy in the fourth quarter which made landfall in the new jersey area as a category storm  impacting the northeast marine transportation operations 
the year operating results also included a  before taxes  or 
per share  severance charge associated with the integration of kirby offshore marine s administrative functions in the company 
the year operating results included an estimated 
per share negative impact from high water and flooding throughout the mississippi river system and along the gulf intracoastal waterway in the morgan city area during the second quarter  net of certain revenue and cost recovery from contracts with terms that provide reimbursements for delays and increased costs 
the year results also included a 
per share credit in the provision for taxes on income associated with a favorable multi year ruling  partially offset by a 
per share severance charge associated with the consolidation of kirby offshore marine s administrative staff with the administrative staff of the company 
marine transportation for  of the company s revenue was generated by its marine transportation segment 
the segment s customers include many of the major petrochemical and refining companies that operate in the united states 
products transported include intermediate materials used to produce many of the end products used widely by businesses and consumers plastics  fiber  paints  detergents  oil additives and paper  among others  as well as residual fuel oil  ship bunkers  asphalt  gasoline  diesel fuel  heating oil and agricultural chemicals 
consequently  the company s inland marine transportation business and coastal black oil and petrochemical business tend to mirror the volumes produced by the company s petrochemical and refining customer base  while the company s coastal refined products business tends to mirror the general performance of the united states economy 
the company marine transportation results include the operations of allied  acquired on november   penn  acquired on december  and kirby offshore marine  acquired on july   and described below

driven by a low cost natural gas feedstock advantage afforded to united states petrochemical producers  petrochemical demand remained strong throughout the year 
black oil demand also remained strong  driven by continued stable refinery output  healthy export levels of heavy fuel oil  and the movement of canadian and bakken crude oil from the midwest to the gulf coast  as well as the movement of south texas crude oil along the gulf intracoastal waterway 
refined product demand remained positive  benefiting from additional volumes from major customers 
agricultural chemical demand was favorable  as demand returned early for the traditional fall fertilizer season 
the company s inland petrochemical and black oil products fleets achieved consistent tank barge utilization levels in the to range throughout during  approximately of the inland marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot contract revenues 
time charters  which insulate the company from revenue fluctuations caused by weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines  represented of the inland revenues under term contracts during compared with during inland term contract rates renewed in each of the quarters increased in the to average range compared with term contracts in the corresponding quarters of spot contract rates  which include the cost of fuel  increased modestly in each quarter compared with the prior quarters 
effective january   annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of multi year contracts resulted in rate increases on those contracts in the range  excluding fuel 
the coastal marine transportation operations reflected improvements in market conditions during the second half  with tank barge utilization improving to the to range in the third quarter and to in the fourth quarter  and some days higher  compared with for the first six months 
during the second half  and particularly the fourth quarter  the coastal market experienced increased demand for crude and condensates moves  as well as success in expanding the coastal customer base to inland customers with coastal requirements 
the acquisitions of allied and penn during the fourth quarter also contributed to the higher revenues and operating income  more than offsetting the additional interest expense and transaction fees incurred 

table of contents during  approximately of the coastal marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot contract revenues 
as of december   with the acquisitions of allied and penn  along with stronger demand for coastal tank barges  approximately of the coastal operations revenues were under term contracts 
coastal time charters represented approximately of the revenues under term contracts during for the coastal operations  term contracts renewed in the first six months were relatively stable compared with contract rates in the first six months 
no term contracts were renewed in the third quarter 
contracts renewed in the fourth quarter increased in the to average range compared with the fourth quarter 
spot contract rates for the first and second quarter were relatively stable compared with the corresponding prior quarter 
spot contract rates for the third quarter improved in the to average range compared with the second quarter  while spot contract rates for the fourth quarter increased in the to average range compared with the third quarter 
the operating margin was compared with for the slight improvement in operating margin was primarily a reflection of higher inland tank barge utilization and higher inland term and spot contract rates negotiated throughout  partially offset by a lower but improved operating margin for the coastal operations 
diesel engine services during  the diesel engine services segment generated of the company s revenue  of which was generated from manufacturing  from overhauls and service and from direct parts sales 
the results of the diesel engine services segment are largely influenced by the economic cycles of the marine and power generation markets and the land based pressure pumping and oilfield services industries 
the and results include the operations of united  acquired on april   and described above 
the following table shows the markets serviced by the company  the revenue distribution for  and the customers for each market markets serviced revenue distribution customers land based land based oilfield services  oil and gas operators and producers  compression  on highway transportation marine inland river carriers dry and liquid  offshore towing dry and liquid  offshore oilfield services drilling rigs supply boats  harbor towing  dredging  great lakes ore carriers power generation standby power generation  pumping stations diesel engine services revenue for increased and operating income decreased compared with the increase in revenue reflected the acquisition of united on april   a strong first quarter land based market that benefited from the manufacture and remanufacture of pressure pumping units  as well as favorable sales and service of diesel engines and transmissions 
land based revenues for the last nine months of saw revenues decline as low natural gas prices led to a decline in drilling for natural gas in north american shale formations  resulting in lower demand for the manufacturing of land based pressure pumping units  as well as a decline in service of land based diesel engines and sales of diesel engines  transmissions and parts 
partially offsetting the decline in the manufacturing of pressure pumping units was the demand for other service equipment  as well as an increase in the number of pressure pumping units to be remanufactured 
the segment also experienced higher service work for oil service customers as the gulf of mexico oil and gas drilling activity increased  partially offset by weakness in the second half in the midwest and gulf coast marine markets resulting from the deferral of large engine overhaul projects driven by the low water issues on the mississippi river from and hurricane isaac during the third quarter 
revenue from the power generation market was consistent with for engine generator set upgrades and parts sales for both domestic and international customers 
as a result of the weak land based oil service industry  the results included a credit of  to selling  general and administrative expenses  resulting from a net decrease in the fair value of the contingent earnout liability associated with the acquisition of united 

table of contents the operating margin for was  including the positive earnings impact of the  credit to the contingent earnout liability  compared with for the lower operating margin for reflected the weak land based oil services market due to the curtailment in the manufacturing of pressure pumping units and softer sales and service of land based diesel engines and transmissions 
cash flow and capital expenditures the company continued to generate strong operating cash flows during with net cash provided by operating activities of  compared with net cash provided by operating activities for of  the increase for was primarily from higher net earnings attributable to kirby  higher depreciation and amortization and a higher deferred tax provision in versus  partially offset by a  greater net decrease in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
in addition  during and  the company generated cash of  and  respectively  from the exercise of stock options  and  and  respectively  from proceeds from the disposition of assets 
for  cash generated and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility and private placement of senior notes were used for capital expenditures of  including  for inland tank barge and towboat construction   for progress payments on the construction of two offshore articulated dry bulk barge and tugboat units scheduled for completion in the first half   primarily for upgrading the existing marine transportation inland and coastal fleets and diesel engine services facilities  and  for acquisitions of businesses and marine equipment 
the company s debt to capitalization ratio increased to at december  from at december   primarily due to borrowing under the new senior notes loan to finance the purchase of penn and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility used to purchase the asset of allied  less the increase in total equity from net earnings attributable to kirby for of  stock issued with a fair value of  in connection with the acquisition of penn  exercise of stock options and the amortization of unearned equity compensation 
as of december   the company had  outstanding under its revolving credit facility   outstanding under the term loan  of which  was classified as current portion of long term debt  and  of senior notes outstanding 
during  the company s inland operation took delivery of new inland tank barges  added inland tank barges from lyondell that the company previously operated for lyondell  and transferred in four tank barges from the coastal operations  increasing capacity by approximately  barrels 
during  the company s inland operation retired inland tank barges and returned a net three charter inland tank barges  reducing capacity by approximately  barrels 
the company inland operation also took delivery of five inland towboats 
the company projects that capital expenditures for will be in the  to  range 
the construction program will consist of inland tank barges with a total capacity of  barrels and three inland towboats 
based on current commitments  steel prices and projected delivery schedules  the company s payments on new inland tank barges and towboats will be approximately  and approximately  in progress payments on the construction of two offshore articulated dry bulk barge and tugboat units for delivery in the first half with an estimated total cost of  for each unit 
the balance of approximately  to  is primarily capital upgrades and improvements to existing marine equipment and marine transportation and diesel engine services facilities 
outlook petrochemical and black oil products inland tank barge utilization levels remained strong during in the to range 
while the united states economy remains sluggish  with consistently high unemployment levels and weak consumer confidence  the united states petrochemical industry continues to see strong production levels for both domestic consumption and exports 
low priced domestic natural gas  a basic feedstock for the united states petrochemical industry  provides the industry with a competitive advantage against foreign petrochemical producers 
as a result  united states petrochemical production improved during and has remained strong throughout  thereby producing increased marine transportation volumes for basic petrochemicals to both domestic consumers and terminals for foreign destinations 
the black oil products market also continued to improve during and  primarily due to a continued stable united states refinery utilization level aided by the export of diesel fuel and heavy fuel oil  and demand for the transportation of crude oil from shale formations in south texas  as well as the movement of canadian and bakken crude oil from the midwest to the gulf coast 

table of contents the united states petrochemical industry is globally competitive based on a number of factors  including a highly integrated and efficient transportation system of pipelines  tank barges  railroads and trucks  largely depreciated yet well maintained and operated facilities  and a low cost feedstock slate  which includes natural gas 
certain united states producers have announced plans for plant capacity expansions and the reopening of idled petrochemical facilities 
the current production volumes from the company s petrochemical customers have resulted in the company s inland tank barge utilization levels in the to range and any increased production from current facilities  plant expansions or the reopening of idled facilities should drive feedstock and production volumes higher  in turn leading to higher tank barge utilization levels and higher term and contract pricing  which could be mitigated by additional tank barge capacity 
at the end of  the company estimated there were approximately  inland tank barges in the industry fleet  of which approximately were over years old and approximately of those over years old 
given the age profile of the industry inland tank barge fleet  the expectation is that older tank barges will continue to be removed from service and replaced by new tank barges that will enter the fleet 
during and early  with the improved demand for inland petrochemical and black oil product tank barges and federal tax incentives on new equipment  the company estimates that approximately inland tank barges were ordered industry wide for delivery throughout many older tank barges will be retired  but the extent of the retirements is dependent on petrochemical and refinery production levels  crude oil movements and industry wide tank barge utilization levels 
during and the first half of  the marine transportation segment was negatively impacted by excess coastal tank barge capacity 
the coastal operations reflected improvements in market conditions during the second half  with tank barge utilization improving to the to range in the third quarter and to in the fourth quarter  and some days higher  compared with for the first six months 
during the second half  and particularly the fourth quarter  the coastal market experienced increased demand for crude and condensates moves  improvements in the overall condition of the coastal vessels  as well as success in expanding the coastal customer base to include inland customers with coastal requirements 
the acquisitions of allied and penn during the fourth quarter also contributed to the higher revenues and operating income  more than offsetting the additional interest expense and transaction fees incurred 
at the end of  the company estimated there were approximately tank barges operating in the  barrel or less coastal industry fleet 
the company believes that very few coastal tank barges were built during and  and that no orders for coastal tank barges have been placed for deliveries 
in the diesel engine services segment  with the increase in drilling rigs operating in the gulf of mexico during late and  service activity levels have reflected a modest improvement and should continue to modestly improve as drilling activity increases 
the land based diesel engine services market consists of manufacturing and remanufacturing of oilfield service equipment  including pressure pumping units  and servicing their components  which include high speed diesel engines  transmissions and pumps  many of the same components used by marine customers 
currently  an estimated million horsepower is employed in the north american pressure pumping business 
with the current low price of natural gas  the exploration of united states natural gas shale formations declined  resulting in excess pressure pumping horsepower 
however  with the current high price of crude oil  the exploration of united states crude oil shale formations has remained positive 
as a result of the excess pressure pumping horsepower  new orders for pressure pumping units have essentially stopped and the supply and distribution portion of the land based market has slowed 
while the company expects its land based diesel engine business to remain profitable  it does not expect any significant improvement in this market until late or early the focus of the company  currently as well as into the future  will be on the remanufacturing and service of existing pressure pumping equipment 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below 
it is also suggested that the company s significant accounting policies  as described in the company s financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable 
the company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business 
the company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectible receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of the company s customers  however  the current united states and global recession could impact the collectability of certain customers trade receivables which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
property  maintenance and repairs 
property is recorded at cost 
improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred 
depreciation is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets 
when property items are retired  sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in the statement of earnings 
maintenance and repairs on vessels built for use on the inland waterways are charged to operating expense as incurred and includes the costs incurred in uscg inspections unless the shipyard extends the life or improves the operating capacity of the vessel which results in the costs being capitalized 
the company s ocean going vessels are subject to regulatory drydocking requirements after certain periods of time to be inspected  have planned major maintenance performed and be recertified by the abs 
these recertifications generally occur twice in a five year period 
the company defers the drydocking expenditures incurred on its ocean going vessels due to regulatory marine inspections by the abs and amortizes the costs of the shipyard over the period between drydockings  generally or months  depending on the type of major maintenance performed 
drydocking expenditures that extend the life or improve the operating capability of the vessel result in the costs being capitalized 
routine repairs and maintenance on ocean going vessels are expensed as incurred 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment by vessel class whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
the assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used  and estimated salvage values 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 

table of contents goodwill 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase are included in goodwill 
management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is typically measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average weighted cost of capital 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
accrued insurance 
the company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk liquid and dry cargo in a marine environment 
the company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible  below which the company is liable 
in addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred  the company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the company  or are not yet fully developed 
the company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of reserves 
if the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed  the required level of reserves for claims incurred but not reported or fully developed could be materially understated 
the company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the company s deductible 
if the solvency of the insurers became impaired  there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance

marine transportation the company  through its marine transportation segment  is a provider of marine transportation services  operating tank barges and towing vessels  transporting bulk liquid products throughout the mississippi river system  on the gulf intracoastal waterway  and along all three united states coasts and in alaska and hawaii 
the company transports petrochemical  refined petroleum products  black oil products and agricultural chemicals by tank barge 
as of december   the company operated inland tank barges  with a total capacity of million barrels  compared with inland tank barges at december   with a total capacity of million barrels 
the company operated an average of inland towboats during and during the company s coastal tank barge fleet as of december  consisted of tank barges  two of which were single hull and of which were chartered  with million barrels of capacity  and tugboats 
this compares with coastal tank barges  three of which were single hull and of which were chartered  with million barrels of capacity  and tugboats as of december  the company operates eight offshore dry bulk barge and tugboat units  of which one of the barges and two of the tugboats are chartered  engaged in the offshore transportation of dry bulk cargoes

the increase also reflected strong united states petrochemical production levels and stable refinery production levels  resulting in equipment utilization levels in the to range for the inland petrochemical and black oil products fleets  as well as favorable term and spot contract pricing 
in addition  average diesel fuel prices for increased compared with  positively impacting marine transportation revenues since fuel price increases are covered by fuel escalation and de escalation clauses in the company s term contracts  or the customer pays for the fuel 

table of contents during the third quarter  the inland operations experienced low water conditions throughout the mississippi river system 
during the fourth quarter  conditions deteriorated between st 
louis  missouri and cairo  illinois  as well as on the illinois river  however  water levels improved late in the fourth quarter on the lower mississippi and ohio rivers 
the low water conditions required a reduction in tow sizes  slower transit times and draft reductions on tank barges with mississippi river destinations all resulting in lower revenues 
water levels on the gulf intracoastal waterway remained at normal levels and were not impacted by the low water levels on the mississippi river system 
the third quarter was negatively impacted by hurricane isaac which made landfall at the mouth of the mississippi river on august  as a category storm  impacting both the inland and coastal transportation operations and gulf coast diesel engine services operations 
the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by hurricane sandy which made landfall near atlantic city  new jersey as a category storm  impacting coastal operations along the atlantic seaboard and new york harbor

the petrochemical market  the company s largest market  contributed of the marine transportation revenues for  reflecting continued strong business levels 
low priced natural gas  a basic feedstock for the united states petrochemical industry  provided the industry with a competitive advantage over foreign petrochemical producers 
as a result  united states petrochemical production remained strong during  producing stable marine transportation volumes for the movement of basic petrochemicals for both domestic consumers and terminals for foreign destinations 
the company entered the coastal petrochemical market with the acquisition of allied on november  the refined petroleum products market  which contributed of marine transportation revenues  reflected higher demand for the movement of products in the inland market  benefiting from additional volumes from major customers 
the coastal refined products market saw overall equipment utilizations in the to for the majority of  with demand increasing in the fourth quarter 
the black oil products market  which contributed of marine transportation revenues  also reflected stronger demand  driven by steady refinery production levels  the export of heavy fuel oil  demand for crude oil transportation from the eagle ford shale formations in south texas both along the gulf intracoastal waterway and in the gulf of mexico  and for the movement of canadian and bakken crude downriver from the midwest to the gulf coast 
the coastal fleet also moved bakken crude from albany  new york to northeast refineries during the second half 
with the acquisition on december  of penn  the company expanded its coastal black oil movements  including refinery feedstocks  asphalt and crude oil 
the agricultural chemical market  which contributed of marine transportation revenues  saw the traditional spring fill start early in the first quarter and continue through april and may 
the traditional fall fill started early in july and continued through september with the movement of both domestically produced and imported products  driven by low fertilizer inventories 
the low water levels and the midwest drought negatively impacted demand during the fourth quarter 

table of contents the coastal marine transportation operations reflected improvements in market conditions during the second half  with tank barge utilization improving to the to range in the third quarter and to in the fourth quarter  and some days higher  compared with for the first six months 
during the second half  and particularly the fourth quarter  the coastal market experienced increased demand for crude and condensates moves  as well as success in expanding the coastal customer base to inland customers with coastal requirements 
the acquisitions of allied and penn during the fourth quarter also contributed to the higher revenues and operating income  more than offsetting the additional interest expense and transaction fees incurred 
for  the inland operations of the marine transportation segment incurred  delay days  less than the  delay days that occurred during delay days measure the lost time incurred by a tow towboat and one or more tank barges during transit when the tow is stopped due to weather  lock conditions and other navigational factors 
low water conditions on the mississippi river system  starting in mid may  and continuing through the remainder to the year  created delays 
hurricane isaac also created delays in the third quarter 
for the first quarter  weather and water conditions in the midwest were better compared with the first quarter of  but fog and high winds along the gulf coast during the first quarter created delays days in excess of the first quarter 
lock repairs on the gulf intracoastal waterway and the ohio river during the first and second quarters also created delays 
during the fourth quarter  low water levels on the mississippi river between cairo  illinois and st 
louis  missouri  as well as on the illinois river  caused delays 
during  approximately of inland marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot contract revenues 
inland operations time charters  which insulate the company from revenue fluctuations caused by weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines  represented of the revenues under term contracts during compared with during the term contract and spot contract mix provides the inland operations with a predictable revenue stream 
during  approximately of the coastal marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot contract revenues 
as of december   with the acquisitions of allied and penn  along with stronger demand for coastal tank barges  approximately of the coastal revenues were under term contracts 
coastal time charters represented approximately of the revenues under term contracts during inland operations term contracts renewed throughout increased in the to average range compared with term contracts renewed throughout spot contracts throughout  which include the cost of fuel  increased modestly compared with effective january   annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of inland operations multi year contracts resulted in rate increases on those contracts in the range  excluding fuel 
for the coastal operations  term contracts renewed in the first six months were relatively stable compared with contract rates in the first six months 
no term contracts were renewed in the third quarter 
contracts renewed in the fourth quarter increased in the to average range compared with the fourth quarter 
spot contract rates for the first and second quarter were relatively stable compared with the corresponding prior quarter 
spot contract rates for the third quarter improved in the to average range compared with the second quarter  while spot contract rates for the fourth quarter increased in the to average range compared with the third quarter 
marine transportation costs and expenses costs and expenses  as well as costs of sales and operating expenses  for increased compared with  reflecting the kirby offshore marine acquisition effective july   and to a lesser extent the allied and penn acquisitions in late  as well as higher costs and expenses associated with increased inland marine transportation demand and higher diesel fuel prices

the company estimates that allied and penn contributed 
per share to earnings  more than offsetting the additional interest expense and transaction fees incurred with the acquisitions 
the operating margin was compared with for the slight improvement was primarily a reflection of higher inland tank barge utilization and higher inland term and spot contract rates negotiated throughout  partially offset by a lower but improved operating margin for the coastal operations 
compared with marine transportation revenues marine transportation revenues for increased compared with  reflecting the expansion into the coastal transportation business with the acquisition of kirby offshore marine on july  kirby offshore marine contributed approximately of marine transportation revenues 
the increase also reflected strong united states petrochemical production levels and stable refinery production levels  resulting in equipment utilization levels in the low to mid range for the inland petrochemical and black oil products fleets  as well as favorable term and spot contract pricing 
in addition  average diesel fuel prices for increased compared with  positively impacting marine transportation revenues since fuel price increases are covered by fuel escalation and de escalation clauses in the company s term contracts  or the customer pays for the fuel 
marine transportation revenues for the second quarter were negatively impacted from high water and flooding throughout the mississippi river system and along the gulf intracoastal waterway in the morgan city area  net of certain revenues and cost recovery from contracts with terms that provide reimbursements for delays 

table of contents the petrochemical market  the company s largest market  contributed of the marine transportation revenues for throughout  petrochemical demand reflected a continued improvement in business levels with some modest decline in demand reported in the fourth quarter 
lower priced natural gas  a basic feedstock for the united states petrochemical industry  provided the industry with a competitive advantage against foreign petrochemical producers 
as a result  united states petrochemical production continued to improve during  producing increased marine transportation volumes for the movement of basic petrochemicals for both domestic consumers and terminals for export destinations 
the black oil products market  which contributed of marine transportation revenues  also saw demand improve during  driven by the continued steady refinery production levels  the export of heavy fuel oil  refinery maintenance activity  new demand for crude oil transportation from the eagle ford shale formations in south texas and increased demand for the movement of canadian crude oil downriver from the midwest to the gulf coast 
the refined petroleum products market  which contributed of marine transportation revenues  reflected continued lower demand for movements of products both inland and coastal  consistent with prevailing conditions in the united states economy  partially offset by an improvement of river ethanol volumes 
kirby offshore marine  which primarily transports refined petroleum  saw equipment utilization rates in the mid to high  with the atlantic  pacific and hawaii fleets experiencing higher rates  partially offset by lower utilization rates in new york harbor due to overcapacity of equipment in the bunkering markets 
the agricultural chemical market  which contributed of marine transportation revenues  reflected an early midwest spring fill in the first quarter  a very weak second quarter as the spring midwest inventory fill was curtailed due to the heavy rain and flooding which reduced farmers ability to apply fertilizer  and a favorable fall fill late in the third quarter and during portions of the fourth quarter 
for  the inland operations of the marine transportation segment incurred  delay days  more than the  delay days that occurred during delay days measure the lost time incurred by a tow towboat and one or more tank barges during transit when the tow is stopped due to weather  lock conditions and other navigational factors 
the first quarter delay days reflected more severe winter weather conditions  including ice  fog and high water conditions during portions of the quarter 
the second quarter experienced record high water and flooding throughout the mississippi river system and a portion of the gulf intracoastal waterway near morgan city 
the third and fourth quarters reflected more normal weather conditions and water levels 
this compares with the quarters that experienced more normal weather conditions and water levels 
the higher first and second quarter delay days led to increased operating expenses compared with the comparable quarters of during and  approximately of the marine transportation s inland operations revenues were under term contracts and were spot contract revenues 
inland operations time charters  which insulate the company from revenue fluctuations caused by weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines  represented of the revenues under term contracts during compared with during the term contract and spot contract mix provides the marine transportation s inland operations with a predictable revenue stream 
since the acquisition of kirby offshore marine on july   approximately of the coastal operations marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot contract revenues

table of contents for the coastal operations  term contracts renewed in the third and fourth quarters were relatively stable compared with contract rate renewals in the third and fourth quarters and spot contract rates during the third and fourth quarters improved in the to range compared with the prior quarters 
marine transportation costs and expenses costs and expenses for increased compared with costs of sales and operating expenses for increased compared with  partially reflecting the kirby offshore marine acquisition  as well as higher costs and expenses due to improved inland operations demand and higher diesel fuel costs 
in addition  unfavorable winter weather and operating conditions during the first quarter and high water and flooding throughout the mississippi river system during the second quarter contributed to increased operating expenses for the inland operations of the marine transportation segment operated an average of towboats during  of which an average of were chartered  compared with during  of which an average of were chartered 
the average includes the towboats and tugboats purchased in the enterprise and kinder morgan acquisitions 
the increase in the number of towboats operated was a reflection of the higher tank barge utilization levels in the petrochemical and black oil products markets during and additional towboats chartered during the second quarter due to the high water and flooding and restrictions placed on the industry regarding tow sizes and horsepower requirements  and assist towboat requirements at bridges  locks  certain sections of affected waterways and barge fleeting areas
