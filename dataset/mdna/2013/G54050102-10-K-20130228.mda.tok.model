we may explore and discuss opportunities to expand the scope of our alternative investment and private equity activities in europe  the us and elsewhere 
these opportunities could include internal growth of new funds and direct investments by us  partnerships or strategic relationships  investments with third parties or acquisitions of existing funds or management companies 
also  consistent with our obligations to lfcm holdings llc lfcm holdings  we may explore discrete capital markets opportunities 
business environment and outlook economic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance 
as described above  our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in our financial advisory and asset management business segments 
as our financial advisory revenues are for the most part dependent on the successful completion of merger  acquisition  restructuring  capital raising or similar transactions  and our asset management revenues are primarily driven by the levels of assets under management aum  weak economic and global financial market conditions can result in a challenging business environment for m a and capital raising activity as well as our asset management business  but may provide opportunities for our restructuring business 
overall  equity market indices at december  increased in both the us  and outside the us  when compared to such indices at december   with periods of significant volatility during the year 
on an industry wide basis  during m a activity generally decreased as compared to restructuring volume also declined in  as compared to  despite an increase in the number of corporate defaults 
entering  interest rates remain low and corporate cash balances remain high 
global macroeconomic conditions appear to be improving but remain uncertain  especially with respect to europe 
the breadth of our businesses has mitigated the impact of the european financial crisis 
although completed european m a activity declined in and moderately affected our financial advisory business  we believe other advisory opportunities  including opportunities for our sovereign advisory and capital raising businesses  have offset the slowdown 
in our asset management business  most of lam s european clients are invested with lam primarily outside of europe 
those who are invested in europe are invested primarily in european fixed income  which has not had a significant impact on our asset management business 
nonetheless  the business situation in europe remains challenging 

table of contents we intend to leverage our existing infrastructure to capitalize on any global macroeconomic recovery  any upturn in the m a cycle  and any momentum in the global equity markets 
we expect to generate revenue growth by remaining adequately staffed to capitalize on any macroeconomic recovery and deploying our intellectual capital to generate new revenue streams 
we also remain focused on expense management and  in october  announced a number of cost saving initiatives the cost saving initiatives relating to our operations 
see cost saving initiatives below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our outlook with respect to our financial advisory and asset management businesses is described below 
financial advisory in the near to mid term  we expect that the us macroeconomic environment likely will be the strongest of the developed economies 
certain legal decisions in the us reinforce the importance of independent advice  and the global scale and breadth of our financial advisory business allows us to advise on large  complex cross border transactions across a variety of industries 
we continue to develop our range of advisory capabilities 
in europe  we believe our sovereign advisory  restructuring and capital raising businesses have positive growth prospects 
in addition  we believe our businesses throughout the emerging markets  japan and australia position us for growth in these markets  while strengthening and distinguishing our relationships with clients in developed economies 
we recently integrated our brazilian operations based in s o paulo 
we also established the lazard africa initiative  to leverage our sovereign and corporate expertise in the rapidly growing region  for our clients in both developed and developing countries 
asset management despite turbulent markets  we have recently seen investor demand across regions and investment platforms 
in the short to intermediate term  we expect most of our growth will come from defined benefit and defined contribution plans in the developed economies because of their sheer scope and size 
over the longer term  we expect an increasing share of our aum to come from the developing economies in asia  latin america and the middle east  as their retirement systems evolve and individual wealth is increasingly deployed in the financial markets 
our global footprint is already well established in the developed economies and we expect our business in the developing economies will continue to expand 
given our globally diversified platform and our ability to provide investment solutions for a global mix of clients  we believe we are positioned to benefit from growth that may occur in the asset management industry 
we recently extended the global footprint of our asset management business by opening a new office in zurich  and we are planning to open a new office in singapore 
we are continually developing and seeding new investment strategies that extend our existing platforms 
recent examples of growth initiatives include the following investment strategies emerging market debt  core emerging markets  real estate  managed volatility strategies  asian equities and global trend 
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risks and uncertainties emerge continuously  and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties  nor can we assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
see item a  risk factors in this form k 
furthermore  net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter 
overall  we continue to focus on the development of our business  including the generation of stable revenue and earnings growth and stockholder returns  the prudent management of our costs and expenses  the efficient use of our assets and the return of capital to our stockholders

msci world index cac dax ftse topix msci emerging market dow jones industrial average nasdaq s p the fees that we receive for providing investment management and advisory services are primarily driven by the level of aum and the nature of the aum product mix 
accordingly  market movements  foreign currency volatility and changes in our aum product mix will impact the level of revenues we receive from our asset management business when comparing periodic results 
a substantial portion of our aum is invested in equities  
table of contents and market movements reflected in the changes in lazard s aum during the period generally correspond to the changes in global equity market indices 
while our aum at december  increased versus aum at december  primarily reflecting market appreciation  our average aum for increased as compared to our average aum in cost saving initiatives on october   we announced a number of cost saving initiatives to reduce our expenses 
these initiatives include streamlining our corporate structure and consolidating support functions  realigning our investments into areas with potential for the greatest long term return  and creating greater flexibility to retain and attract the best people and invest in new growth areas 
we expect these initiatives will result in improved profitability with minimal impact on revenue growth 
a majority of these initiatives were implemented during the fourth quarter of our objective is to realize approximately million in annual savings from our existing cost base  with approximately million relating to compensation and benefits expense  and approximately million relating to non compensation expense 
we expect at least two thirds of the expense savings to be realized in  and we expect the full impact of the expense savings to be realized in we expect pre tax implementation expenses to range between million and million and to primarily consist of compensation expense 
we incurred million of these expenses in the fourth quarter of  and expect to incur the remainder of these expenses in the first half of approximately of the implementation expenses are expected to be paid in cash 
financial statement overview net revenue the majority of lazard s financial advisory net revenue historically has been earned from the successful completion of m a transactions  strategic advisory matters  restructuring and capital structure advisory services  capital raising and similar transactions 
the main drivers of financial advisory net revenue are overall m a activity  the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities  particularly in the industries and geographic markets in which lazard focuses 
in some client engagements  often those involving financially distressed companies  revenue is earned in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment and are not necessarily linked to the completion of a transaction 
in addition  lazard also earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients  with such fees not being dependent on a specific transaction  and may also earn fees in connection with public and private securities offerings and for referring opportunities to lfcm holdings for underwriting  distribution and placement of securities 
the referral fees received from lfcm holdings are generally one half of the revenue recorded by lfcm holdings in respect of such activities 
significant fluctuations in financial advisory net revenue can occur over the course of any given year  because a significant portion of such net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction  restructuring or capital raising activity  the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to lazard s control 
lazard s asset management segment principally includes lazard asset management llc together with its subsidiaries  lam  lfg and edgewater 
asset management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and advisory services provided to clients 
as noted above  the main driver of asset management net revenue is the level and product mix of aum  which is generally influenced by the performance of the global equity markets and  to a lesser extent  fixed income markets and lazard s investment performance  which impacts its ability to successfully attract and retain assets 
as a result  fluctuations including timing thereof in financial markets and client asset inflows and outflows have a direct effect on asset management net revenue and operating income 
asset management fees are generally based on the level of aum measured daily  monthly or quarterly  and an increase or reduction in aum  due to market price fluctuations  currency fluctuations  changes in product mix  or net client asset flows will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees 
the majority of our investment advisory contracts are generally terminable at any time or on notice of days or less 
institutional and individual clients  and firms with which we have strategic alliances  
table of contents can terminate their relationship with us  reduce the aggregate amount of aum or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance 
in addition  as lazard s aum includes significant amounts of assets that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies will impact the value of lazard s aum 
fees vary with the type of assets managed and the vehicle in which they are managed  with higher fees earned on equity assets  alternative investment funds  such as hedge funds and private equity funds  and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products 
the company earns performance based incentive fees on various investment products  including traditional products and alternative investment funds  such as hedge funds and private equity funds 
for hedge funds  incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund s net appreciation  in some cases in excess of established benchmarks or thresholds 
the company records incentive fees on traditional products and hedge funds at the end of the relevant performance measurement period  when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined 
the incentive fee measurement period is generally an annual period unless an account terminates during the year 
the incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback 
incentive fees on hedge funds generally are subject to loss carryforward provisions in which losses incurred by the hedge funds in any year are applied against certain gains realized by the hedge funds in future periods before any incentive fees can be earned 
for private equity funds  incentive fees may be earned in the form of a carried interest if profits arising from realized investments exceed a specified threshold 
typically  such carried interest is ultimately calculated on a whole fund basis and  therefore  clawback of carried interests during the life of the fund can occur 
as a result  incentive fees earned on our private equity funds are not recognized until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined  including any potential for clawback 
corporate segment net revenue consists primarily of investment gains and losses on the company s seed investments in lam equity and fixed income funds  principal investments in equities and alternative investment funds and equity method investments  net hedging activities  as well as gains and losses on investments held in connection with lazard fund interests and on the extinguishment of debt to the extent applicable  interest income and interest expense 
corporate net revenue also can fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of investments classified as trading  as well as due to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and in the levels of cash  investments and indebtedness 
the company holds no available for sale or held to maturity investments 
although corporate segment net revenue during represented of lazard s net revenue  total assets in the corporate segment represented of lazard s consolidated total assets as of december   which is attributable to investments in government bonds and money market funds  fixed income funds  alternative investment funds and other securities  private equity investments and cash 
operating expenses the majority of lazard s operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits for managing directors and employees 
our compensation and benefits expense includes i salaries and benefits  ii amortization of the relevant portion of previously granted deferred incentive compensation awards  including a share based incentive compensation under the lazard ltd equity incentive plan the plan and the lazard ltd incentive compensation plan the plan and b lazard fund interests awards and other similar deferred compensation arrangements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  iii a provision for discretionary or guaranteed cash bonuses and profit pools and iv when applicable  severance payments 
compensation expense in any given period is dependent on many factors  including general economic and market conditions  our operating and financial performance  staffing levels  competitive pay conditions and the nature of revenues earned  as well as the mix between current and deferred compensation 

table of contents we believe that awarded compensation and benefits expense and the ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue  both non us gaap measures  are the most appropriate measures to assess the actual annual cost of compensation and provide the most meaningful basis for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between present  historical and future years 
awarded compensation and benefits expense for a given year is calculated using adjusted compensation and benefits expense  as modified by the following items we deduct amortization expense recorded for us gaap purposes in each fiscal year associated with the vesting of deferred incentive compensation awards  we add i the grant date fair value of the deferred incentive compensation awards granted applicable to the relevant year end compensation process eg grant date fair value of deferred incentive awards granted in  and related to the  and year end compensation processes  respectively and ii investments in people eg sign on bonuses and other special deferred incentive awards granted throughout the applicable year  with such amounts in i and ii reduced by an estimate of future forfeitures of such awards  and we adjust for year end foreign exchange fluctuations 
for interim periods we use adjusted compensation and benefits expense and the ratio of adjusted compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue  both non us gaap measures  for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between periods 
for the calculations with respect to adjusted compensation and benefits expense and awarded compensation and benefits expense and related ratios to operating revenue  see the table under consolidated results of operations below 
compensation and benefits expense is the largest component of our operating expenses 
our goal is for awarded compensation and benefits expense to rise at a slower rate than operating revenue growth  and if operating revenue declines  awarded compensation and benefits expense should also decline 
in addition  we seek to maintain discipline with respect to the rate at which we award deferred compensation 
based on a similar level and mix of revenues from our business as in and a gradual improvement in the macroeconomic environment  we believe that over the cycle we can attain a ratio of awarded compensation and benefits expense to operating revenue in the mid to high s percentage range 
while we have begun to implement initiatives  including the cost saving initiatives announced in october see cost saving initiatives above and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  that we believe will assist us in attaining a ratio within this range  there can be no guarantee that such a ratio will be attained or that our policies or initiatives will not change in the future 
we may benefit from pressure on compensation costs within the financial services industry in future periods  however  increased competition for senior professionals  changes in the macroeconomic environment or the financial markets generally  lower operating revenue  changes in the mix of revenues from our businesses or various other factors could prevent us from attaining this goal 
lazard s operating expenses also include non compensation expense which includes costs for occupancy and equipment  marketing and business development  technology and information services  professional services  fund administration and outsourced services and other expenses  the provisions pursuant to the tax receivable agreement with lfcm holdings  amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions and  in  the relevant portion of the expense relating to the first quarter staff reductions and the implementation of the cost saving initiatives in the fourth quarter of and  in  restructuring expense see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of intangible assets relates primarily to the acquisition of edgewater 
provision for income taxes as a result of its indirect investment in lazard group  lazard ltd  through certain of its subsidiaries  is subject to us federal income taxes on its portion of lazard group s operating income 
lazard group primarily operates in the us as a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
as a result  lazard group s income pertaining to the limited liability company is not subject to us 
table of contents federal income taxes because taxes associated with such income represent obligations of the individual partners 
outside the us  lazard group operates principally through corporations and is subject to local income taxes 
income taxes shown on lazard s consolidated statements of operations are principally related to foreign taxes from non us entities and to new york city unincorporated business tax ubt attributable to lazard s operations apportioned to new york city 
noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests primarily consist of amounts related to edgewater s management vehicles that the company is deemed to control but not own and the amount attributable to laz md holdings ownership interest in the net income of lazard group 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the company s noncontrolling interests 
consolidated results of operations lazard s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars 
many of our non us subsidiaries have a functional currency ie  the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted that is other than the us dollar  generally the currency of the country in which the subsidiaries are domiciled 
such subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using exchange rates as of the respective balance sheet date  while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the respective periods based on the daily closing exchange rates 
adjustments that result from translating amounts from a subsidiary s functional currency are reported as a component of members stockholders equity 
foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on transactions in non functional currencies are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap

net revenue in increased million  or  with operating revenue increasing million  or  respectively  as compared to fee revenue from investment banking and other advisory activities increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in m a and other advisory fees  partially offset by a decrease in restructuring fees 
the increase in m a and other advisory fee revenue was primarily driven by the strong 
table of contents performance of lazard middle market and the overall breadth and volume of our global m a and sovereign advisory businesses

money management fees decreased million during in the aggregate  interest income  other revenue and interest expense reflected an increase in net revenue of million as compared to such increase was principally due to increases in investment income including a gain relating to the increase in market value of investments underlying lazard fund interests  which are equally offset by a corresponding increase in compensation and benefits expense  that was partially offset by decreases in other revenue due to the million gain on the repurchase of the company s subordinated promissory note in  as well as decreases in referral fees from lfcm holdings and commissions

such charges primarily relate to severance costs and benefit payments  with million and million of the respective charges relating to the acceleration of unrecognized amortization expense of deferred incentive compensation previously granted to individuals being terminated 
amortization expense of previously granted deferred incentive compensation awards related to deferred compensation the grant  which had a comparatively longer  four year vesting period  also contributed to the increase

each segment s operating expenses include i compensation and benefits expenses that are incurred directly in support of the segment and ii other operating expenses  which include directly incurred expenses for occupancy and equipment  marketing and business development  technology and information services  professional services  fund administration and outsourcing  and indirect support costs including compensation and benefits expense and other operating expenses related thereto for administrative services 
such administrative services include  but are not limited to  accounting  tax  legal  facilities management and senior management activities 
such support costs are allocated to the relevant segments based on various statistical drivers such as revenue  headcount  square footage and other factors

net revenue trends in financial advisory for m a and other advisory and restructuring are generally correlated to the volume of completed industry wide m a and restructuring transactions occurring subsequent to corporate debt defaults  respectively 
however  deviations from this relationship can occur in any given year for a number of reasons 
for instance  our results can diverge from industry wide activity where there are material variances from the level of industry wide m a activity in a particular market where lazard has significant market share  or regarding the relative number of our advisory engagements with respect to larger sized transactions  and where we are involved in non public or sovereign advisory assignments 
while the industry statistics for global completed m a transactions described above reflect a decrease in m a activity in as compared to  our m a and other advisory revenue which includes sovereign and government advisory revenue increased in as compared to certain lazard fee and transaction statistics are set forth below year ended december  lazard statistics number of clients with fees greater than million total financial advisory m a and other advisory percentage of total financial advisory net revenue from top clients a number of m a transactions completed with values greater than billion b a no individual client constituted more than of our financial advisory segment net revenue in the years ended december   or b source thomson reuters as of january  the geographical distribution of financial advisory net revenue is set forth below in percentage terms and is based on the lazard offices that generate financial advisory net revenue  which are located in the us  europe primarily in the uk  france  italy  spain and germany and the rest of the world primarily in australia and therefore may not be reflective of the geography in which the clients are located 

table of contents year ended december  united states europe rest of world total the company s managing directors and many of its professionals have significant experience  and many of them are able to use this experience to advise on m a  strategic advisory matters and restructuring transactions  depending on clients needs 
this flexibility allows lazard to better match its professionals with the counter cyclical business cycles of mergers and acquisitions and restructurings 
while lazard measures revenue by practice area  lazard does not separately measure the costs or profitability of m a services as compared to restructuring services 
accordingly  lazard measures performance in its financial advisory segment based on overall segment net revenue and operating income margins 
financial advisory results of operations year ended december  versus december  total strategic advisory net revenue  representing fees from m a and other advisory and capital raising businesses  increased million  or  and restructuring revenue decreased million  or  as compared to m a and other advisory revenue increased million  or  as compared to capital raising revenue decreased million  or 
the increase in m a and other advisory revenue was primarily due to the strong performance of lazard middle market and a higher level of fees earned from our top clients  reflecting the closing of several significant m a and sovereign advisory transactions 
our major clients  which in the aggregate represented of our m a and other advisory revenue for the year  included aeroporti di roma  azur pharm  bta bank jsc  caisse des d p ts  delphi financial group  glaxosmithkline  google  government of greece  medco health solutions  pireaus bank and progress energy 
the decrease in capital raising revenue in was primarily attributable to a decrease in referral fees from lfcm holdings and a decrease in private placement activity 
restructuring revenue is derived from various activities including bankruptcy assignments  global debt and financing restructurings  distressed asset sales and advice on complex on and off balance sheet assignments 
the decrease in restructuring revenue in was generally in line with the industry wide low level of corporate restructuring activity 
notable assignments completed in included assignments for cemex  eastman kodak  lehman brothers  newpage corporation and tribune company

the decrease in capital raising revenue in was primarily attributable to a lower level of closings by our private fund advisory group 
the decline in restructuring revenue was driven by a cyclical decline in global restructuring activity  resulting in a lower number of active assignments in  as compared to the prior year  and a corresponding decrease in completion fees 
notable assignments completed in included energy alloys  nortel networks  station casinos and westgate resorts

cash flows the company s cash flows are influenced by the timing of the receipt of financial advisory and asset management fees  the timing of distributions to shareholders  payments of incentive compensation to managing directors and employees and purchases of class a common stock and  in  repurchases of debt 
m a  and other advisory  and asset management fees are generally collected within days of billing  while restructuring fee collections may extend beyond days  particularly those that involve bankruptcies with court ordered holdbacks 
fees from our private fund advisory activities are generally collected over a four year period from billing and typically include an interest component 
the company makes cash payments for  or in respect of  a significant portion of its incentive compensation during the first three months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year s results

liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity and capital resources are derived from operating activities  financing agreements and equity offerings 
operating activities net revenue  operating income and cash receipts fluctuate significantly between quarters 
in the case of financial advisory  fee receipts are generally dependent upon the successful completion of client transactions  the occurrence and timing of which is irregular and not subject to lazard s control 
liquidity is significantly impacted by cash payments for  or in respect of  incentive compensation  a significant portion of which are made during the first three months of the year 
as a consequence  cash on hand generally declines in the beginning of the year and gradually builds over the remainder of the year 
we also pay certain tax 
table of contents advances during the year on behalf of our managing directors  which serve to reduce their respective incentive compensation payments 
we expect this seasonal pattern of cash flow to continue 
we expect liquidity also to be impacted by cash payments  including severance payments  associated with the cost saving initiatives announced in october see cost saving initiatives above and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the remaining portion of which we expect will be paid during the first half of lazard s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars 
many of lazard s non us subsidiaries have a functional currency ie  the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted that is other than the us dollar  generally the currency of the country in which such subsidiaries are domiciled 
such subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the respective balance sheet date exchange rates  while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year based on the daily closing exchange rates

at december   lazard had approximately million of cash  with such amount including approximately million held at lazard s operations outside the us 
since lazard provides for us income taxes on substantially all of its unrepatriated foreign earnings  no material amount of additional us income taxes would be recognized upon receipt of dividends or distributions of such earnings from its foreign operations 
we maintain lines of credit in excess of anticipated liquidity requirements

furthermore  in order to help offset the dilutive effect of our share based incentive compensation plans  during a given year lazard intends to repurchase at least as many shares as it expects to ultimately issue pursuant to such plans in respect of year end incentive compensation attributable to the prior year 
as of december   after giving effect to the forward purchase agreements described in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  million of the current share repurchase amount authorized as of such date remained available under the share repurchase program  all of which expires on december  under the terms of the plan and the plan  upon the vesting of rsus and delivery of restricted class a common stock  shares of class a common stock may be withheld by the company to meet the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements

regulatory capital we actively monitor our regulatory capital base 
our principal subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements in their respective jurisdictions to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity  which require  among other things  that we comply with certain minimum capital requirements  record keeping  reporting procedures  relationships with customers  experience and training requirements for employees and certain other requirements and procedures 
these regulatory requirements may restrict the flow of funds to and from affiliates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information

see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements regarding information in connection with commitments  incentive plans  employee benefit plans and income taxes  respectively 
effect of inflation we do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs as they are substantially variable in nature 
however  the rate of inflation may affect certain of our other expenses  such as information technology and occupancy costs 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets or general macroeconomic conditions  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by reducing aum  net revenue or otherwise 
see item a  risk factors other business risks difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways  including by reducing the volume of the transactions involving our financial advisory business and reducing the value or performance of the assets we manage in our asset management business  which  in each case  could materially reduce our revenue or income and adversely affect our financial position 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of lazard s consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  lazard evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  compensation liabilities  income taxes  investing activities and goodwill 
lazard bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
lazard believes that the critical accounting policies set forth below comprise the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition lazard generates substantially all of its net revenue from providing financial advisory and asset management services to clients 
lazard recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client  the agreed upon services have been provided  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
the company earns performance based incentive fees on various investment products  including traditional products and alternative investment funds such as hedge funds and private equity funds see financial statement overview for a description of our revenue recognition policies on such fees 
if  in lazard s judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  lazard will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide coverage for estimated losses from our receivables 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on our analysis of the client s creditworthiness and specifically reserve against exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired  which may include situations where a fee is in dispute or litigation has commenced 
with respect to fees receivable from financial advisory activities  such receivables are generally deemed past due when they are outstanding days from the date of invoice 
however  some financial advisory transactions include specific contractual payment terms that may vary from one month to four years as is the case for our private fund advisory fees following the invoice date or may be subject to court approval as is the case with restructuring assignments that include bankruptcy proceedings 
in such cases  receivables are deemed past due when payment is not received by the agreed upon contractual date or the court approval date  respectively 
financial advisory fee receivables past due in excess of days are fully provided for unless there is evidence that the balance is collectible 
asset management fees are deemed past due and fully provided for when such receivables are outstanding months after the invoice date 
notwithstanding our policy for receivables past due  we specifically reserve against exposures relating to financial advisory and asset management fees where we determine receivables are impaired 
at december  and  the company had receivables past due of approximately million and million  respectively  and its allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at such respective dates 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of our tax paying entities in each of their respective jurisdictions 
in addition to estimating actual current tax liability for these jurisdictions  we also must account for the tax effects of differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting of items  such as deferred revenue  compensation and benefits expense  unrealized gains or losses on investments and depreciation and amortization  as well as intercompany transactions such as revenue sharing  dividends and interest expense 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities as discussed below  any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets and our unrecognized tax benefits 
a deferred tax asset is recognized if it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of greater than that a tax benefit will be accepted by a taxing authority 
the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon currently enacted tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions 
at december   on a consolidated basis  we recorded gross deferred tax assets of approximately billion 

table of contents subsequent to the initial recognition of deferred tax assets  we also must continually assess the likelihood that such deferred tax assets will be realized 
if we determine that we may not fully derive the benefit from a deferred tax asset  we consider whether it would be appropriate to apply a valuation allowance against the applicable deferred tax asset 
in order to determine whether we apply a valuation allowance  we must assess whether it is more likely than not that such asset will be realized  taking into account all available information 
the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset for a particular entity depends  among other things  on the generation of taxable income by such entity in the applicable jurisdiction 
although we have been profitable on a consolidated basis in the last three years  certain of our tax paying entities have individually experienced minimal profits on a cumulative three year basis and losses in  primarily due to permanent differences between net income and taxable income at such entities 
considering the recent operating results of such entities and the other factors listed below  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately billion on our deferred tax assets as of december we consider multiple possible sources of taxable income when assessing a valuation allowance against a deferred tax asset  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback years  and tax planning strategies 
the assessment regarding whether a valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available information  including the following nature  frequency and magnitude of any past losses and current operating results  duration of statutory carryforward periods  historical experience with tax attributes expiring unused  and near term and medium term financial outlook 
the weight we give to any particular item is  in part  dependent upon the degree to which it can be objectively verified 
we give greater weight to the recent results of operations of a relevant entity 
pre tax operating losses on a three year cumulative basis or lack of sustainable profitability are considered significant evidence and will generally outweigh a projection of future taxable income 

table of contents the table below sets forth our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets  as of december  and december  in thousands deferred tax assets basis adjustments primarily as a result of the separation and recapitalization transactions that occurred during and from secondary offerings compensation and benefits net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards depreciation and amortization other gross deferred tax assets valuation allowance total deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance deferred tax liabilities depreciation and amortization compensation and benefits goodwill other total deferred tax liabilities as mentioned previously  certain of our tax paying entities have individually experienced minimal profits on a cumulative basis over the past several years and losses in if these entities achieve sustainable levels of profitability in the future  we believe that the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets at such entities could be reduced significantly 
if any significant valuation allowance reduction were to occur  we would likely have a negative effective tax rate in the period in which such reduction occurs 
included in our deferred tax assets as of december  are approximately million related to certain basis step ups and approximately million of net operating losses generated by the amortization of such step up assets 
under our tax receivable agreement  lazard group will retain of the actual cash tax savings relating to such assets and will pay of such savings to the owners of lazard prior to the separation 
as a result  in the event of a reduction of our valuation allowance  we also would recognize a liability relating to the portion expected to be payable under the tax receivable agreement 
the creation of this liability could potentially offset a significant amount but not all of the income we would otherwise recognize upon a release of the valuation allowance 
if any valuation allowance reduction were to occur  for subsequent periods  our effective tax rate  with all other factors being held constant  would increase and could be significantly higher than our effective tax rate in the period immediately preceding the reduction in the valuation allowance 
in such a situation  an increase in our effective tax rate would not impact the amount of cash income taxes we would pay in those periods subsequent to the release of any valuation allowance 
the company records tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based upon the amount that is more likely than not to be realized or paid  including in connection with the resolution of any related appeals or other legal processes 
accordingly  the company recognizes liabilities for certain unrecognized tax benefits based on the amounts that are more likely than not to be settled with the relevant taxing authority 
such liabilities are evaluated periodically as new information becomes available and any changes in the amounts of such liabilities are recorded as adjustments to income tax expense 
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits involve 
table of contents significant judgment and the ultimate resolution of such matters may be materially different from our estimates 
in addition to the discussion above regarding deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowances  as well as unrecognized tax benefit liability estimates  other factors affect our provision for income taxes  including changes in the geographic mix of our business  the level of our annual pre tax income  transfer pricing and intercompany transactions

the company holds no available for sale or held to maturity securities 
gains and losses on investment positions held  which arise from sales or changes in the fair value of the investments  are not predictable and can cause periodic fluctuations in net income or  if applicable  aoci  and therefore subject lazard to market and credit risk

goodwill in accordance with current accounting guidance  goodwill has an indefinite life and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
for years prior to  lazard made estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities and to project future earnings using various valuation techniques 
commencing in  as permitted under an amendment issued by the financial accounting standards board  the company elected to perform a qualitative evaluation about whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in lieu of actually calculating the fair value of the reporting unit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill 
consolidation of variable interest entities the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lazard group and entities in which it has a controlling interest 
lazard determines whether it has a controlling interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity vie under us gaap 
voting interest entities 
voting interest entities are entities in which i the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and ii the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses  the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity s activities 
lazard is required to consolidate a voting interest entity that it maintains an ownership interest in if it holds a majority of the voting interest in such entity 
variable interest entities 
vies are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity 
if lazard has a variable interest  or a combination of variable interests in a vie  it is required to analyze whether it needs to consolidate such vie 
lazard is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are vies and holds variable interests in such vies 
transactions associated with these entities primarily include investment management  real estate and private equity investments 
those vies for which lazard is determined to be the primary beneficiary are consolidated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance 
risk management we encounter risk in the normal course of business  and therefore  in order to help manage and monitor such risks  we have designed risk management processes which consider both the nature of our business and our operating model 
we are subject to varying degrees of credit and market risk  including risks related to the level of soundness of our clients  financial  governmental and other institutions and third parties  as well as operational and liquidity risks see liquidity and capital resources and  where appropriate  we monitor these risks at both an entity level and on a consolidated basis 
management within each of lazard s operating locations is principally responsible for managing the risks within its respective businesses on a day to day basis 
market and credit risks related to our investing activities are discussed under critical accounting policies and estimates investments above 
risks related to lazard s other activities are presented below 
lazard has established procedures to assess credit and market risks  as well as specific interest rate and currency risk  and has established limits related to various positions 

table of contents risks related to receivables we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide coverage for probable losses from our receivables 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on our analysis of the client s creditworthiness and specifically provide for exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired 
at december   total receivables amounted to million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
as of that date  financial advisory and asset management fees  and customer and related party receivables comprised  and of total receivables  respectively

lfb engages in lending activities  including commitments to extend credit 
at december  and  customer receivables included million and million of lfb loans  respectively 
such loans are closely monitored for counterparty creditworthiness to help minimize exposure 
in addition  as of december   lfb had commitments to lend totaling million  which are fully collateralized and generally contain requirements for the counterparty to maintain a minimum collateral level 
credit concentrations to reduce the exposure to concentrations of credit  the company monitors large exposures to individual counterparties and  in addition  lfb has in place concentration risk limits 
at december   excluding inter bank counterparties  lfb had no exposure to an individual counterparty that exceeded million  with such amount being fully collateralized 
with respect to activities outside lfb  as of december  the company s largest individual counterparty exposure was a financial advisory fee receivable of million 
risks related to derivatives lazard enters into interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge exposures to interest rates and currency exchange rates and uses equity and fixed income swap contracts to hedge a portion of its market exposure with respect to certain seed investments related to our asset management business 
derivative contracts are recorded at fair value 
derivative assets amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively  and derivative liabilities  excluding the derivative liability arising from the company s obligation pertaining to lazard fund interests and other similar deferred compensation arrangements  amounted to million and million at such respective dates 
the company also records derivative liabilities relating to its obligations pertaining to lazard fund interests awards and other similar deferred compensation arrangements  the fair value of which is based on the value of the underlying investments  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
changes in the fair value of the derivative liabilities are equally offset by the changes in the fair value of investments which are currently expected to be delivered upon settlement of lazard fund interests awards 
derivative liabilities relating to lazard fund interests amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  lfb enters into interest rate swaps  forward foreign exchange contracts and other derivative contracts to hedge exposures to interest rate and currency fluctuations on open positions that arise primarily from client activity 
such foreign currency and interest rate positions are subject to strict internal limits and  based on account balances as of december   the impact of potential significant movements in either the currency or interest rate markets on lfb s positions would not materially affect the company s annual operating income 

table of contents risks related to short term investments and corporate indebtedness a significant portion of the company s indebtedness has fixed interest rates  while its cash and short term investments generally have floating interest rates 
based on account balances as of december   lazard estimates that its annual operating income relating to cash and short term investments and corporate indebtedness would increase by approximately million in the event interest rates were to increase by and decrease by approximately million if rates were to decrease by 
as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately million 
substantially all of the company s cash and cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid institutional money market funds a significant majority of which were invested solely in us government or agency money market funds or in short term interest earning accounts at a number of leading banks throughout the world  or in short term certificates of deposit from such banks 
cash and cash equivalents are constantly monitored 
on a regular basis  management reviews its investment profile as well as the credit profile of its list of depositor banks in order to adjust any deposit or investment thresholds as necessary 
operational risks operational risk is inherent in all our business and may  for example  manifest itself in the form of errors  breaches in the system of internal controls  business interruptions  fraud or legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance 
the company maintains a framework including policies and a system of internal controls designed to monitor and manage operational risk and provide management with timely and accurate information 
management within each of the operating companies is primarily responsible for its operational risk programs 
the company has in place business continuity and disaster recovery programs that manage its capabilities to provide services in the case of a disruption 
we purchase insurance programs designed to protect the company against accidental loss and losses  which may significantly affect our financial objectives  personnel  property or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups
