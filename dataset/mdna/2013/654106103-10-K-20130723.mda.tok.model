item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nike designs  develops  markets and sells athletic footwear  apparel  equipment  accessories and services worldwide 
we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world 
we sell our products to retail accounts  through nike owned retail stores and internet websites  which we refer to as our direct to consumer operations  and through a mix of independent distributors  licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world 
our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear  apparel  equipment  accessories and service businesses 
our strategy is to achieve long term revenue growth by creating innovative  must have products  building deep personal consumer connections with our brands  and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online 
in addition to achieving long term  sustainable revenue growth  we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas expanding gross margin by making our supply chain a competitive advantage  reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency  product design and innovation  and delivering innovative  premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a strong consumer price to value proposition 
improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit  and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of businesses to eliminate duplicative costs  improving working capital efficiency  and deploying capital effectively 
through execution of this strategy  our long term financial goals continue to be high single digit revenue growth  mid teens earnings per share growth  increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows  and consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses 
over the past ten years  we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals 
during this time  revenues and earnings per share for nike  inc  inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations  have grown and  respectively  on an annual compounded basis 
our return on invested capital has increased from to and we expanded gross margins by approximately basis points 
on november   we announced a two for one stock split of both class a and class b common shares 
the stock split was in the form of a percent stock dividend payable on december  to shareholders of record at the close of business december  common stock began trading at the split adjusted price on december  all share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split 
our fiscal results from continuing operations demonstrated the power of the nike  inc portfolio to deliver consistent growth in revenues  earnings  and cash returns to shareholders  while investing for long term growth 
despite the ongoing challenges in the global economy  we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal our revenues grew to billion  net income from continuing operations increased to billion  and we delivered diluted earnings per share of  an increase from fiscal earnings before interest and income taxes for continuing operations increased for fiscal  driven by revenue growth and improved gross margin  which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in revenues was driven by growth across most nike brand geographies  key categories and product types 
this growth was primarily fueled by innovative performance and sportswear products  incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as nike air  lunar  shox  free  flywire  dri fit  flyknit  nike  and nike fuel  deep brand connections to consumers through a category lens  reinforced by investments in endorsements by high profile athletes and teams such as the nfl  fc barcelona  michael jordan  high impact marketing around global sporting events such as the olympics  european football championships and nba finals and digital marketing  and strong category retail presentation online and at nike owned and retail partner stores 
revenues also improved for each of our other businesses converse  nike golf and hurley 
our gross margins improved largely due to the positive impact of higher average selling prices  partially offset by higher product input costs  primarily labor cost inflation  and foreign currency headwinds 
for fiscal  the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a year over year decrease in our effective tax rate 
in addition  diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding  as a result of share repurchases during fiscal on may   we announced our intention to divest of the cole haan and umbro businesses  which would allow us to better focus our resources on driving growth in the nike  jordan  converse and hurley brands 
during the second quarter of fiscal we completed the sale of certain assets of the umbro brand and recorded a loss on the sale of these assets of million  net of tax 
during the third quarter of fiscal we completed the sale of cole haan and recorded a gain on sale of million  net of tax

the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period 
this is due to year over year changes in shipment timing  because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at once orders  and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues

while growth in these lower gross margin segments delivers incremental revenue and profits  it has a negative effect on our consolidated gross margin 
fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  our consolidated gross margin was basis points lower than the prior year period  primarily driven by higher product input costs  including materials and labor  across most businesses 
also contributing to the decrease in gross margin were higher customs duty charges  discounts on close out sales and an increase in investments in our digital business and infrastructure

while china futures orders for the next six months are in line with last year  we expect revenues for the first half of the fiscal year will be below last year as we continue to manage the amount of product we ship into the market 
we believe our revenue in china will stabilize around prior year levels in the second half of this fiscal year 
fiscal compared to fiscal excluding changes in currency exchange rates  greater china revenues increased for fiscal  driven by continued expansion in the number of both nike mono branded stores owned by our wholesale customers and nike owned stores  as well as higher comparable store sales 
excluding changes in currency exchange rates  the growth in greater china s footwear revenue for fiscal was primarily driven by double digit percentage growth in unit sales and a mid single digit growth in average unit price per pair  reflective of product price increases 
the overall increase in footwear sales was driven by double digit percentage growth across most key categories  led by running and sportswear 
excluding changes in currency exchange rates  the growth in greater china s apparel revenues for fiscal was mainly driven by a high single digit growth in the average selling price per unit and a low single digit percentage increase in unit sales 
the increase in average selling price was reflective of product price increases  partially offset by higher discounts on in line and close out products to accelerate the sales of slower moving apparel inventories 
on a reported basis  revenues for greater china increased for fiscal  while ebit grew  as revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in gross margin and an increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues 
gross margin decreased basis points for fiscal  primarily attributable to higher product input costs and discounts on close out products  which more than offset the favorable impact of product price increases 
selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues increased basis points  driven by an increase in operating overhead expense

fy change revenues loss before interest and taxes corporate revenues primarily consist of certain intercompany revenue eliminations and foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the nike brand geographic operating segments and certain other businesses but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program 
corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses  including expenses associated with centrally managed departments  depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters  unallocated insurance  benefit and compensation programs  including stock based compensation  certain foreign currency gains and losses  including certain hedge gains and losses  certain intercompany eliminations and other items 
in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in corporate revenues  foreign currency results included in gross margin are gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non functional currency denominated product purchases within the nike brand geographic operating segments and certain other businesses and related foreign currency hedge results 
all other foreign currency related results  including conversion gains and losses arising from re measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency derivative instruments  are included in other income expense  net 
fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  corporate loss before interest and taxes increased by million primarily due to the following a million increase in foreign exchange losses related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the nike brand geographic operating segments and certain other businesses  net of hedge gains  these losses are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin 
a million decrease in foreign currency net losses  reported as a component of consolidated other income expense  net 
a million increase in corporate overhead expense related to corporate initiatives to support the growth of the business and performance based compensation 
fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  corporate loss before interest and taxes grew million  mainly due to an increase of million in performance based compensation and a year over year net increase of million from foreign currency impacts 
these foreign currency impacts were driven by a year over year increase in foreign currency net losses  arising from certain euro us dollar foreign currency hedges and the re measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in various non functional currencies  net of related undesignated forward instruments  as a variety of foreign currencies weakened against the us dollar year over year 
the above impacts were partially offset by a slight decrease in centrally managed operating overhead expenses 
foreign currency exposures and hedging practices overview as a global company with significant operations outside the united states  in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates 
our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations  financial position and cash flows into us dollars 
our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to nike  inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical and material  by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options 
as described below  the implementation of the nike trading company ntc and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures 
our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes 
table of contents on the underlying net exposures being hedged 
where exposures are hedged  our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements  the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
transactional exposures we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk 
our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are product costs nike s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity a 
certain nike entities purchase product from the ntc  a wholly owned sourcing hub that buys nike branded products from third party factories  predominantly in us dollars 
the ntc  whose functional currency is the us dollar  then sells the products to nike entities in their respective functional currencies 
when the ntc sells to a nike entity with a different functional currency  the result is a foreign currency exposure for the ntc 
b 
other nike entities purchase product directly from third party factories in us dollars 
these purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those nike entities with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
in both purchasing scenarios  a weaker us dollar reduces the inventory cost incurred by nike whereas a stronger us dollar increases its cost 
factory input costs in january  nike implemented a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories 
the program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures  some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures 
under this program  our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies factory currency exposure index in which the labor  materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of nike branded products factory input costs are denominated 
for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory  the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third party 
all currencies within the indices  excluding the us dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory  are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other income expense  net 
refer to note risk management and derivatives for additional detail 
as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating us dollar on our non functional currency denominated product purchases described above  a strengthening us dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases nike s us dollar inventory cost 
conversely  a weakening us dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 
non functional currency denominated external sales a portion of our western europe and central eastern europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the euro eg british pound but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the euro as its functional currency 
these sales generate a foreign currency exposure 
other costs non functional currency denominated costs  such as endorsement contracts  intercompany royalties and other intercompany charges  also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent 
non functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities  primarily receivables and payables  denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
these balance sheet items are subject to re measurement  which may create fluctuations in other income expense  net within our consolidated results of operations 
managing transactional exposures transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program 
we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows  including certain product cost exposures  non functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above 
generally  these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging  except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below 
certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging 
accordingly  changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other income expense  net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re measurement of the related non functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged 
refer to note fair value measurements and note risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end 
translational exposures many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets  operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting 
the translation of foreign subsidiaries non us dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to oci within shareholders equity 
in the translation of our consolidated statements of income  a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings 
the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a benefit detriment of approximately million and million for the years ended may  and  respectively 
the impact of foreign exchange rate 
table of contents fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a benefit detriment of approximately million and million for the years ended may  and  respectively 
managing translational exposures to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting  certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated available for sale investments 
the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at us dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging 
we utilize forward contracts and or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments 
the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year over year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold 
hedges of available for sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
refer to note fair value measurements and note risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end 
we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses and the year over year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense  net had an unfavorable impact of approximately million on our income before income taxes for the year ended may  and had an insignificant impact for the year ended may  net investments in foreign subsidiaries we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings 
we have hedged and may  in the future  hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments 
in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense  net 
the impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented 
to minimize credit risk  we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration 
upon maturity  the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in oci 
there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may  and cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled million for the year ended may  liquidity and capital resources cash flow activity cash provided by operations was billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal was net income of billion 
our fiscal change in working capital was a net cash outflow of million  which is exclusive of working capital amounts sold as part of the divestitures of umbro and cole haan  as compared to a net cash outflow of million for fiscal our investments in working capital decreased due to slowing growth in inventory and reductions in accounts receivable compared to the prior year 
during fiscal  inventory for continuing operations increased compared to a increase for fiscal  the slowing growth was driven by our continued focus on increasing inventory productivity 
the reduction in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the collection of receivables related to discontinued operations 
cash used by investing activities was  million during fiscal  compared to a million source of cash for fiscal a major driver of the change was the swing from net sales maturities of short term investments in fiscal to net purchases of short term investments in fiscal  reflective of the additional purchases of short term investments made with the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in april in fiscal  there were  million of net sales maturities of short term investments net of purchases  while in fiscal we made  million in net purchases of short term investments net of sales maturities 
this impact was partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of umbro and cole haan in fiscal cash used by financing activities was  million for fiscal compared to  million for fiscal the decrease in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in april also contributing to the decrease were lower payments of long term debt and notes payable and lower repurchases of common stock  which were partially offset by a reduction in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  we purchased million shares of nike s class b common stock for billion  an average price of 
during the year  we completed the four year  billion share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in september under that program  we purchased a total of million shares at an average price of 
subsequently  we began repurchases under a four year  billion program approved by the board in september as of the end of fiscal  we had repurchased million shares at a cost of million under this current program 
we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow  excess cash  and or debt 
the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 
capital resources on april   we filed a shelf registration statement the shelf with the sec which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities 
the shelf expires on april  on april   we issued billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in and the senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of million at a fixed  annual interest rate and will mature on may  the senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of million at a fixed  annual interest rate and will mature on may  interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually on may and november of each year 
the issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of million 
we will use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  which may include  but are not 
table of contents limited to  discharging or refinancing debt  working capital  capital expenditures  share repurchases  as yet unplanned acquisitions of assets or businesses and investments in subsidiaries 
on november   we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to billion with lender approval 
the facility matures november   with a one year extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date  provided that extensions shall not extend beyond november  as of and for the year ended may   we had no amounts outstanding under our committed credit facility 
we currently have long term debt ratings of a and a from standard and poor corporation and moody investor services  respectively 
if our long term debt rating were to decline  the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase 
conversely  if our long term debt rating were to improve  the facility fee and interest rate would decrease 
changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility 
under this committed revolving credit facility  we have agreed to various covenants 
these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets  the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur  as well as a minimum capitalization ratio 
in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant  and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate  any borrowings would become immediately due and payable 
as of may   we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 
liquidity is also provided by our billion commercial paper program 
during the year ended may   we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of million 
as of may   there were no outstanding borrowings under this program 
we may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal depending on general corporate needs 
we currently have short term debt ratings of a and p from standard and poor corporation and moody investor services  respectively 
as of may   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling billion  of which billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks  money market funds  tier commercial paper  corporate notes  us treasury obligations  us government sponsored enterprise obligations  and other investment grade fixed income securities 
our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk 
all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk 
while individual securities have varying durations  as of may  the average duration of our short term investments and cash equivalents portfolio is days 
despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets  to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs 
future volatility in the capital markets  however  may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated by operations  together with access to external sources of funds as described above  will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed 
we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which us taxes have previously been provided 
we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings  and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings 
should we require additional capital in the us  we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the us through debt 
if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds  we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes less applicable foreign tax credits 
if we elect to raise capital in the us through debt  we would incur additional interest expense 
off balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements  we routinely provide indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights  coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor 
currently  we have several such agreements in place 
however  based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss  we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations our significant long term contractual obligations as of may  and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows description of commitment cash payments due during the year ending may  in millions thereafter total operating leases capital leases long term debt endorsement contracts product purchase obligations other total the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products 
actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and or royalties on product sales in future periods 
actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods 
in addition to the cash payments  we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use 
it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product 
the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors  including general playing conditions  the number 
table of contents of sporting events in which they participate  and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives 
in addition  the costs to design  develop  source  and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 
we generally order product at least to months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from customers 
the amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms 
in some cases  prices are subject to change throughout the production process 
the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of may  other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
the amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders for non product purchases 
the reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of may  the total liability for uncertain tax positions was million  excluding related interest and penalties  at may  we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur

in millions outstanding as of may  notes payable  due at mutually agreed upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand payable to sojitz america for the purchase of inventories  generally due days after shipment of goods from a foreign port as of may   letters of credit of million were outstanding  which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the company s performance under certain self insurance and other programs 
recently adopted accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
this accounting standard update will be effective for us beginning june   and early adoption is permitted 
we early adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
this guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
this new guidance was effective for us beginning june  the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
this new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders equity 
companies are now required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
this requirement was effective for us beginning june  as this guidance only amended the presentation of the components of comprehensive income  the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
further  this guidance required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
this requirement will be effective for us beginning june  as this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income  we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments 
this new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements 
this new guidance is effective for us beginning june  as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures  we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policies for revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves  and contingent payments under endorsement contracts 
these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the 
table of contents six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
revenue recognition we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks 
in certain countries outside of the us  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location 
on the basis of our tests of actual transactions  we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns  discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded 
our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns  discounts and claims  specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers  and estimated returns  discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers 
actual returns  discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns  discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 
contingent payments under endorsement contracts a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts 
in general  endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract 
however  certain contract elements may be accounted for differently  based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 
some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg  winning a championship 
we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 
some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg  maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year 
these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period 
in these instances  to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser s athletic performance  increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 
some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products 
we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur 
in certain contracts  we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments 
for contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product  we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 
property  plant and equipment and definite lived assets property  plant and equipment  including buildings  equipment  and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including  in some cases  the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened  we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant 
table of contents adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  among others 
if such facts indicate a potential impairment  we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group 
if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable  we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows 
any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group s carrying amount and its estimated fair value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or when events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value 
events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate  operating results  planned investments in the reporting unit  planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  among other factors 
we may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
the two step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis 
in step two of the analysis  we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over its implied fair value  if any 
we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach 
the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future 
our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital  long term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit business  and working capital effects 
the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size  growth  profitability  risk and return on investment  and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 
indefinite lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks 
we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is not impaired  no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary 
if a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets  we utilize the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them 
this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands  the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 
fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date 
in general  and where applicable  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments  including us treasury securities 
in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities  such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data  including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments such as commercial paper and bonds  us agency securities and money market funds 
level investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 
a majority of our available for sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level or level investments  as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing 
observable inputs include broker quotes  interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals  volatilities and credit risks 
our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded 
these controls include an analysis of period over period fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor 
hedge accounting for derivatives we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain non functional currency monetary assets and liabilities 
when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met  changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income  rather than net income  until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
in most cases  this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their very nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels  or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter  we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in fair values of the over hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other income expense  net during the quarter in which such changes occur 
we have used and may  in the future  use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 
the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity  to the extent effective  to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments 
as the value of our underlying net 
table of contents investments in wholly owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed  the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk 
accordingly  the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness 
we consider  on a quarterly basis  the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment 
should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels  the cumulative change in fair value of the over hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which changes occur 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock based compensation on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility 
expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year  along with other factors 
our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset  which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 
in addition  we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation 
despite this approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
for instance  the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations  or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 
conversely  our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
in this case  our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year 
this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items  to determine the year to date tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 
on a quarterly basis  we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  settled audit issues and new audit activity 
changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other income expense  net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses  we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability 
while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty  we do not believe any currently identified claim  proceeding or litigation  either individually or in aggregate  will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures  we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 
it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures  we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations  primarily as a result of our international sales  product sourcing and funding activities 
our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party and intercompany transactions 
we have  and may in the future  also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 
where exposures are hedged  our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 
the timing for hedging exposures  as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed  are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions 
generally  hedged transactions are expected to be recognized within to months 
when intercompany loans are hedged  it is typically for their expected duration 
hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros  british pounds and japanese yen 
see section foreign currency exposures and hedging practices under item for additional detail 
our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates 
our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a mix of commercial paper  bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed rate debt 
market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk var 
our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency option contracts  interest rate swaps  intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 
we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only 
the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period 
the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate 
we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate 
this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions  firm commitments  cash balances  and accounts and loans receivable and payable  including those which are hedged by these instruments 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments  derived using the var model  was million and million at may  and  respectively 
the var increased year over year as a result of an increase in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio combined with a longer average duration on our outstanding trades at may  such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps 
intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation 
furthermore  our non functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts  which are included in the var calculation above 
therefore  we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position  results from operations and cash flows 
details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates at may

accordingly  the monthly translation of these instruments  which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates  is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary
