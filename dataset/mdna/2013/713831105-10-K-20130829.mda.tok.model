item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies inventory 
if we are unable to successfully meet these competitive challenges  we may be unable to maintain and grow our business 
any inability on our part to compete successfully would also adversely affect our results of operations and impair our financial condition 
our competitors include analog devices  cypress semiconductor  fairchild semiconductor  hitachi  integrated device technology  maxim integrated products  motorola  on semiconductor  nxp  parade technologies  plx technology  silicon laboratories  stmicroelectronics  texas instruments  and toshiba 
most of those competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing customer relationships than we do 
we also compete with other major or emerging companies that sell products to certain segments of our markets 
competitors with greater financial resources or broader product lines may have a greater ability to sustain price reductions in our primary markets in order to gain or maintain market share 
we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to continue to improve and develop our products and processes 
unlike us  many of our competitors maintain internal manufacturing capacity for the fabrication and assembly of semiconductor products 
this ability may provide them with more reliable manufacturing capability  shorter development and manufacturing cycles and time to market advantages 
in addition  competitors with their own wafer fabrication facilities that are capable of producing products with the same design geometries as ours may be able to manufacture and sell competitive products at lower prices 
any introduction of products by our competitors that are manufactured with improved process technology could seriously harm our business 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  our competitors have developed and marketed products that function similarly or identically to ours 
if our products do not achieve performance  price  size or other advantages over products offered by our competitors  we might lose market share 
competitive pressures could also reduce market acceptance of our products  reduce our prices and increase our expenses 
we also face competition from the makers of asics and other system devices 
these devices may include interface logic functions that may eliminate the need or sharply reduce the demand for our products in particular applications 
downturns in the semiconductor industry  rapidly changing technology  accelerated selling price erosion and evolving industry standards can harm our operating results 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and periodically subject to significant economic downturns  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of selling prices  overcapacity and excess and obsolete inventory as well as rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards 
in the future  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in our business and operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions  overall economic conditions or other factors 
our business is also subject to the risks associated with the effects of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of semiconductor products 
recent domestic and worldwide economic conditions adversely affected and could have future adverse effects on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our revenues and earnings have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
general economic or other conditions could cause a downturn in the market for our products or technology 
the financial disruption affecting the banking system  investment banks  insurance companies and the financial markets negatively impacted general domestic and global economic conditions 
these economic conditions resulted in our facing a very challenging period leading to reduced sales and earnings in fiscal in and  concerns over european sovereign debt and the ability of countries to borrow funds have again raised questions about the loan portfolios of large international banks  and low economic growth rates have increased the possibility of an economic downturn 
in our sales were again down from the prior year due to continued economic softness in many parts of the world and only tepid growth in others 
there could be a number of effects on our business that could also adversely affect our operating results 
disruptions may result in the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays  the inability of our customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and or customer insolvencies that cause our customers to change delivery schedules  cancel or reduce orders  a slowdown in global economies which could result in lower end user demand for our products  and increased impairments of our investments 
net income could vary from expectations depending on the gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of securities  gains or losses from equity method investments  and impairment charges related to goodwill  intangible assets  long term assets  investments and marketable securities 
our cash and marketable securities investments represent significant assets that may be subject to fluctuating or even negative returns depending upon interest rate movements and financial market conditions in fixed income securities 
volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk of substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations in our earnings 
given the current economic environment  we remain cautious and we expect our customers to be cautious as well  which could affect our future results 
if the economic recovery slows down or dissipates  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
the complexity of our products makes us susceptible to manufacturing problems  which could increase our costs and delay our product shipments 
the manufacture and assembly of our products is highly complex and sensitive to a wide variety of factors  including the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of manufacturing personnel and production equipment 
in a typical semiconductor manufacturing process  silicon wafers produced by a foundry are cut into individual die 
these die are assembled into individual packages and tested for performance 
our wafer fabrication suppliers have from time to time experienced lower than anticipated yields of suitable die 
in the event of such decreased yields  we would incur additional costs to sort wafers  an increase in average cost per usable die and an increase in the time to market or availability of our products 
these conditions could reduce our net revenues and gross margin and harm our customer relations 
we rely on independent manufacturers who may not be able to meet our manufacturing requirements 
we do not manufacture any of our ic products 
therefore  we are referred to in the semiconductor industry as a fabless producer 
we depend upon third party foundries to produce wafers and subcontractors to manufacture ic products that meet our specifications 
we currently have third party manufacturers located in china  taiwan  singapore  malaysia  india  korea and japan that can produce products that meet our needs 
however  as the industry continues to progress to smaller manufacturing and design geometries  the complexities of producing semiconductors will increase 
decreasing geometries may introduce new problems and delays that may affect product development and deliveries 
due to the nature of the industry and our status as a fabless ic semiconductor company  we could encounter fabrication related problems that may affect the availability of our products  delay our shipments or increase our costs 
our contracts with our wafer suppliers do not obligate them to a minimum supply or set prices 
any inability or unwillingness of our wafer suppliers generally  and globalfoundries  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and magnachip semiconductor magnachip in particular  to meet our manufacturing requirements would delay our production and product shipments and harm our business 
in recent years  we purchased over of our wafers from magnachip  tsmc and globalfoundries  with the balance from other wafer suppliers 
our reliance on independent wafer suppliers to fabricate our wafers at their production facilities subjects us to possible risks such as lack of adequate capacity or assured product supply  lack of available manufactured products  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and unanticipated changes in wafer prices 
any inability or unwillingness of our wafer suppliers to provide adequate quantities of finished wafers to meet our needs in a timely manner would delay our production and product shipments and seriously harm our business 
in march  globalfoundries shut down one of their production facilities used to manufacture our products 
we transitioned the production of these products to different facilities 
the transfer of production of our products to other facilities subjects us to the above listed risks as well as potential yield or other production problems  which could arise as a result of any change 
at present  we purchase wafers from our suppliers through the issuance of purchase orders based on our rolling nine month forecasts 
the purchase orders are subject to acceptance by each wafer supplier 
we do not have long term supply contracts that obligate our suppliers to a minimum supply or set prices 
we also depend upon our wafer suppliers to participate in process improvement efforts  such as the transition to finer geometries 
if our suppliers are unable or unwilling to do so  our development and introduction of new products could be delayed 
furthermore  sudden shortages of raw materials or production capacity constraints can lead wafer suppliers to allocate available capacity to customers other than us or for their internal uses  interrupting our ability to meet our product delivery obligations 
any significant interruption in our wafer supply would seriously harm our operating results and our customer relations 
our reliance on independent wafer suppliers may also lengthen the development cycle for our products  providing time to market advantages to our competitors that have in house fabrication capacity 
in the event that our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture our key products in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify additional wafer foundries 
the qualification process can take up to nine months or longer 
furthermore  we are unable to predict whether additional wafer foundries will become available to us or will be in a position to satisfy any of our requirements on a timely basis 
we depend on single or limited source assembly subcontractors with whom we do not have written contracts 
any inability or unwillingness of our assembly subcontractors to meet our assembly requirements would delay our product shipments and harm our business 
we primarily rely on foreign subcontractors for the assembly and packaging of our products and  to a lesser extent  for the testing of finished products 
some of these subcontractors are our single source supplier for some of our packages 
in addition  changes in our or a subcontractor s business could cause us to become materially dependent on a single subcontractor 
we have from time to time experienced difficulties in the timeliness and quality of product deliveries from our subcontractors and may experience similar or more severe difficulties in the future 
we generally purchase these single or limited source components or services pursuant to purchase orders and have no guaranteed arrangements with these subcontractors 
these subcontractors could cease to meet our requirements for components or services  or there could be a significant disruption in supplies from them  or degradation in the quality of components or services supplied by them 
any circumstance that would require us to qualify alternative supply sources could delay shipments  result in the loss of customers and limit or reduce our revenues 
introducing new products or transferring existing products to a new third party manufacturer or process may result in unforeseen product specification and operating problems 
these problems may affect our shipments and may be costly to correct 
we may experience integration or other problems with potential future acquisitions  which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
new acquisitions could dilute the interests of existing stockholders  and the announcement of new acquisitions could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
our previous and potential future acquisitions could result in the following large one time write offs  the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner  the challenges in achieving strategic objectives  cost savings  and other benefits from acquisitions as anticipated  the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from other business concerns  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations  the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies and capabilities acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  excessive usages of cash  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets  difficulties in the assimilation of operations  personnel  technologies  products and the information systems of the acquired companies  and difficulties in integrating or expanding information technology systems and other financial or business processes that may lead to financial reporting issues 
as part of our business strategy  we may seek acquisition prospects that would complement our existing product offerings  improve our market coverage or enhance our technological capabilities 
in addition  from time to time  we invest in other companies  without actually acquiring them  and such investments involve many of the same risks as are involved with acquisitions 
implementation of new financial accounting standards board fasb rules and the issuance of new corporate governance regulations or other accounting regulations  or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations  could materially impact our business or stated results 
in general  from time to time the government  courts and the financial accounting boards may issue new corporate governance regulations or accounting regulations  or modify or reinterpret existing ones 
there may be future changes in laws  interpretations or regulations that would affect our financial results or the way in which we present them 
additionally  changes in the laws or regulations could have adverse effects on hiring and many other aspects of our business that would affect our ability to compete  both nationally and internationally 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act required the sec to establish new disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in their products  whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties 
when these new requirements are implemented  they could adversely affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products 
there will also be costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements  including for due diligence in regard to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products  in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products  processes  or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities 
if we are unable to maintain processes and procedures to sustain effective internal control over our financial reporting  our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports could be harmed and this could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
under the rules promulgated under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or sarbanes oxley act  we are required to maintain  and evaluate the effectiveness of  our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
in our annual reports on form k for the years ended july   june   june  and july   we reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
we have since remediated these deficiencies and continue to spend a significant amount of time and resources to ensure compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of as reported in item a of this form k  our management does not believe that we had any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of june   and management has determined that as of june   our internal control over financial reporting was effective 
however  we have and will continue to evolve our business in a changing marketplace 
in addition  we are expanding our overseas operations  and as we grow in these locations  we may have difficulty in recruiting and retaining a complement of personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge  experience and training in the application of us generally accepted accounting principles commensurate with our financial reporting requirements 
due to these factors  there can be no assurance that other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not arise in the future 
should we or our independent registered public accounting firm determine in future periods that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  the reliability of our financial reports may be impacted  and investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price and we could suffer other materially adverse consequences 
changes to environmental laws and regulations applicable to manufacturers of electrical and electronic equipment are causing us to redesign our products  and may increase our costs and expose us to liability 
the implementation of new environmental regulatory legal requirements  such as lead free initiatives  may affect our product designs and manufacturing processes 
the impact of such regulations on our product designs and manufacturing processes could affect the timing of compliant product introductions as well as their commercial success 
redesigning our products to comply with new regulations may result in increased research and development and manufacturing and quality control costs 
in addition  the products we manufacture that comply with new regulatory standards may not perform as well as our current products 
moreover  if we are unable to successfully and timely redesign existing products and introduce new products that meet new standards set by environmental regulation and our customers  sales of our products could decline  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we compete with others to attract and retain key personnel  and any loss of or inability to attract key personnel would harm us 
to a greater degree than non technology companies  our future success will depend on the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel 
none of these individuals has an employment agreement with us and each one would be difficult to replace 
we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of these individuals 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel or the inability to continue to attract qualified personnel could delay product development cycles or otherwise harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success also will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales  marketing  finance and management personnel  particularly highly skilled design  process and test engineers  for whom competition can be intense 
during strong business cycles  we expect to experience difficulty in filling our needs for qualified engineers and other personnel 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  our revenues  operations and product development efforts could be harmed 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could harm our competitive position 
litigation regarding intellectual property could divert management attention  be costly to defend and prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents and licenses and preserve other intellectual property rights covering our products and development and testing tools 
in the united states  we currently hold patents covering certain aspects of our product designs and have eight additional patent applications pending 
copyrights  mask work protection  trade secrets and confidential technological know how are also key to our business 
additional patents may not be issued to us or our patents or other intellectual property may not provide meaningful protection 
we may be subject to  or initiate  interference proceedings in the us patent and trademark office 
these proceedings can consume significant financial and management resources 
we may become involved in litigation relating to alleged infringement by us of others patents or other intellectual property rights 
this type of litigation is frequently expensive to both the winning party and the losing party and takes up significant amounts of management s time and attention 
in addition  if we lose such a lawsuit  a court could require us to pay substantial damages and or royalties or prohibit us from using essential technologies 
for these and other reasons  this type of litigation could seriously harm our business 
also  although we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights in order to bring an end to certain claims or actions asserted against us  we may not be able to obtain such a license on reasonable terms or at all 
because it is important to our success that we are able to prevent competitors from copying our innovations  we intend to continue to seek patent  trade secret and mask work protection for our technologies 
the process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive  and we cannot be certain that any currently pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents  or that  even if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
furthermore  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own 
we also rely on trade secret protection for our technology  in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and third parties 
however  these parties may breach these agreements 
in addition  the laws of some territories in which we develop  manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
our independent foundries use a process technology that may include technology we helped develop with them  that may generally be used by those foundries to produce their own products or to manufacture products for other companies  including our competitors 
in addition  we may not have the right to implement key process technologies used to manufacture some of our products with foundries other than our present foundries 
we may not provide adequate allowances for exchanges  returns and concessions 
we recognize revenue from the sale of products when shipped  less an allowance based on future authorized and historical patterns of returns  price protection  exchanges and other concessions 
we believe our methodology and approach are appropriate 
however  if the actual amounts we incur exceed the allowances  it could decrease our revenue and corresponding gross profit 
our future tax rates and tax payments could be higher than we anticipate and may harm our results of operations 
as a multinational corporation  we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions 
the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions 
a number of factors  including unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or by unexpected changes in existing tax laws or our interpretation of them  could unfavorably affect our future effective tax rate 
in the event our management determines it is no longer more likely than not that we will realize a portion of our deferred tax assets we will be required to increase our valuation allowance which will result in an increase in our effective tax rate 
furthermore  our tax returns are subject to examination in all the jurisdictions in which we operate which subjects us to potential increases in our tax liabilities 
we are currently under examination of our federal tax returns for fiscal and by the internal revenue service 
in addition  during the quarter ended december   we began implementation of an operating structure to more efficiently align the company s transaction flows with the company s geographic business operations 
as a result we have formed new legal entities and begun realigning existing ones  completed the intercompany transfer of intellectual property rights  inventory and fixed assets across different tax jurisdictions  and implemented intercompany intellectual property licensing agreements between our us and foreign entities 
these changes may result in unanticipated changes to our tax rates and tax payments 
all of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if our liability for us and foreign taxes is greater than we have anticipated and reserved for  our operating results may suffer 
we are subject to taxation in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions in which we do business  including china 
we believe that we have adequately estimated and reserved for our income tax liability 
however  our effective tax rates may not be as low as we anticipate 
our business operations  including our transfer pricing for transactions among our various business entities operating in different tax jurisdictions  may be audited at any time by the us  chinese or other foreign tax authorities 
a number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates  such as changes in the tax laws of any of the countries in which we pay substantial taxes  including changes to tax rates or to transfer pricing standards  or more fundamental changes such as the various proposals that exist from time to time for us international tax reform  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in us general accepted accounting principles  and the repatriation of non us earnings with respect to which we have not previously provided for us taxes 
a change in our effective tax rate due to any of these factors may adversely impact our future results from operations 
also  changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner 
a large portion of our revenues is derived from sales to a few key customers  and the loss of one or more of our key customers  or their key end user customers  could significantly reduce our revenues 
in addition  our sales through distributors increase the complexity of our business 
a relatively small number of key customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in each of the past several fiscal years 
in general we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
we had two direct customers who each accounted for more than of net revenues during the fiscal years ended june   june  and july  as a percentage of net revenues  sales to our top five direct customers during the fiscal year ended june  totaled  as compared with in the fiscal year ended june  and in the fiscal year ended july  we do not have long term sales agreements with any of our customers 
our customers are not subject to minimum purchase requirements  may reduce or delay orders periodically due to excess inventory and may discontinue purchasing our products at any time 
our distributors typically offer competing products in addition to ours 
for the fiscal year ended june   sales to our domestic and international distributors were approximately of net revenues  as compared to approximately of net revenues in the fiscal year ended june  and approximately of net revenues in the fiscal year ended july  distributors therefore continue to account for a significant portion of our sales 
the loss of one or more significant customers  or the decision by a significant distributor to carry additional product lines of our competitors could decrease our revenues 
selling through distributors increases the complexity of our business  requiring us to  among other matters manage a more complex supply chain  manage the level of inventory at each distributor  provide for credits  return rights and price protection  estimate the impact of credits  return rights  price protection and unsold inventory at distributors  and monitor the financial condition and creditworthiness of our distributors 
any failure to manage these challenges could cause us to inaccurately forecast sales and carry excess or insufficient inventory  thereby adversely affecting our operating results and cash flows 
for further detail on credits  return rights and price protection  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
because we sell products in foreign markets and have operations outside of the united states  we face foreign business  political  economic and currency risks that could seriously harm us 
almost all of our wafer suppliers and assembly subcontractors are located in southeast asia  as are our fcp manufacturing facilities  which exposes us to the problems associated with international operations 
risks associated with international business operations include the following disruptions or delays in shipments  changes in economic conditions in the countries where these subcontractors are located  currency fluctuations  changes in political conditions  potentially reduced protection for intellectual property  foreign governmental regulatory requirements and unexpected changes in them  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export controls  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for technology  changes in tax laws  tariffs and other barriers  and freight rates  and u 
s 
gaap accounting compliance regulatory  geopolitical and other factors could seriously harm our business or require us to modify our current business practices 
we are subject to general geopolitical risks in connection with our international operations  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
although most of our products are sold in us dollars  we incur a significant amount of certain types of expenses  such as payroll  utilities  capital equipment purchases and taxes in local currencies 
the impact of currency exchange rate movements could harm our results and financial condition 
in addition  changes in tariff and import regulations and in us and us monetary policies could harm our results and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing our revenue 
varying tax rates in different jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate 
in fiscal year  we generated approximately of our net revenues from sales in asia and approximately from sales outside of asia and the united states 
in fiscal year  we generated approximately of our net revenues from sales in asia and approximately from sales outside of asia and the united states 
in fiscal year  we generated approximately of our net revenues from sales in asia and approximately from sales outside of asia and the united states 
we expect that foreign sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues 
we intend to continue the expansion of our sales efforts outside the united states 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources and further subject us to international operating risks 
we have subsidiaries located in asia 
we manufacture some of our fcps in taiwan as well as in the jinan development zone in the shandong province of the prc 
the development of the jinan facility depended upon various tax concessions  tax rebates and other support from the local governmental entity 
there can be no assurance that the local governmental entity will not change their position regarding such tax and other support and such a change might adversely affect the profitability of this facility 
in addition  there can be no assurance we will be able to assemble and maintain sufficient management resources in our asia subsidiaries  including a sales force knowledgeable about our target markets and an accounting staff with sufficient u 
s 
gaap accounting expertise 
we are expanding our presence in china with manufacturing and research and development activities 
we will be subject to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the value of the chinese renminbi against the united states dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
significant future appreciation of the renminbi could increase our component and other raw material costs as well as our labor costs  and could adversely affect our financial results 
to the extent that we need to convert united states dollars into renminbi for our operations  appreciation of renminbi against the united states dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
conversely  if we decide to convert our renminbi into united states dollars for other business purposes and the united states dollar appreciates against the renminbi  the united states dollar equivalent of the renminbi we convert would be reduced 
the chinese government recently announced that it is pegging the exchange rate of the renminbi against a number of currencies  rather than just the united states dollar 
fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate could increase and could adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
in addition  there is a potential risk of conflict and further instability in the relationship between taiwan and the prc 
conflict or instability could disrupt the operations of one of our principal wafer suppliers  several of our assembly subcontractors located in taiwan  and our fcp manufacturing operations in taiwan and the prc 
our operations and financial results could be severely harmed by natural disasters 
our headquarters and some of our major suppliers manufacturing facilities are located near major earthquake faults 
in particular  our asian operations and most of our third party service providers involved in the manufacturing of our products are located within relative close proximity 
therefore  any disaster that strikes within or close to that geographic area could be extremely disruptive to our business and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
one of the foundries we use is located in taiwan  which suffered a severe earthquake during fiscal we did not experience significant disruption to our operations as a result of that earthquake 
taiwan is also exposed to typhoons and tsunamis  which can affect not only foundries we rely upon but also our pse tw subsidiary 
in march  an earthquake and tsunami occurred off the northeast coast of japan which disrupted the global supply chain for core materials manufactured in japan that are incorporated in our products and manufacturing equipment 
thailand experienced floods in the quarter ended december   which interrupted the industry s supply chain for storage products and impacted our sales as well 
if a major earthquake  typhoon  tsunami or other natural disaster were to affect our operations or those of our suppliers  our product supply could be interrupted  which would seriously harm our business 
natural disasters could also affect the operations of the distributors and contract manufacturers we sell to  as well as the operations of our end use customers  which would adversely affect our operations and financial results 
natural disasters anywhere in the world may potentially adversely affect us by harming or causing interruptions to our supply chain or the supply chains of our suppliers  direct customers or end use customers 
risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock our stock has been and will likely continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past  and the market prices of the securities of semiconductor companies have been especially volatile 
this market volatility  as well as general economic  market or political conditions  including the current global economic situation  could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance 
our stock price could fluctuate widely in response to factors some of which are not within our control  including general conditions in the semiconductor and electronic systems industries  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  and price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market  which have particularly affected the market prices of many high technology companies 
our shareholder rights plan may adversely affect existing shareholders 
on march   we adopted a shareholder rights plan that may have the effect of deterring  delaying  or preventing a change in control that otherwise might be in the best interests of our shareholders 
under the rights plan  we declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each share of our common stock held by shareholders of record as of march  each right entitles shareholders  after the rights become exercisable  to purchase one one thousandth of a share of our series d junior participating preferred stock 
in general  the rights become exercisable when a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or a tender offer for or more of our common stock is announced or commenced 
after such event  our other stockholders may purchase from us additional shares of our common stock at a discount to the then current market price 
the rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by our board of directors since the rights may be redeemed by us at per right at any time before any person or group acquire or more of our outstanding common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be reasonable given the circumstances 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company to make its most difficult and subjective accounting judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances  which impact the recording of revenues  valuation of inventories  which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins  accounting for income taxes  which impacts the income tax provision and net income  impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and investments  which impacts the goodwill  intangible asset and investment accounts  and share based compensation  which impacts costs of goods sold and operating expenses 
these policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further below 
we also have other important policies that we discuss in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  the company meets these conditions upon shipment because  in most cases  title and risk of loss passes to the customer at that time 
in addition  the company estimates and records provisions for future returns and other charges against revenue at the time of shipment 
we sell products to both large domestic and international distributors 
we sell our products to domestic distributors at the price listed in our price book for that distributor 
at the time of shipment  we record a sales reserve for the entire amount if the customer has the right to return the product 
in addition  at the time of sale we record a sales reserve for ship from stock and debits ssd s  stock rotation amounts expected to be returned  return material authorizations rma s  authorized price protection programs  and any special programs approved by management 
these sales reserves offset revenues  which produces the net revenues amount we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the market price for our products can be significantly different from the book price at which we sold the product to the distributor 
when the market price  as compared with the book price  of a particular sales opportunity from our distributor to their customer would result in low or negative margins to our distributor  we negotiate a ship from stock and debit with the distributor 
we analyze our ssd history and use the history to develop ssd rates that form the basis of the ssd sales reserve we record each period 
we use historical ssd rates to estimate the ultimate net sales price to the distributor 
our distribution agreements provide for semi annual stock rotation privileges in a range from to of net sales for the previous six month period 
the contractual stock rotation applies only to shipments at book price 
asian distributors typically buy our product at less than book price and therefore are not entitled to the stock rotation privilege 
in order to provide for routine inventory refreshing  for our benefit as well as theirs  we typically grant asian distributors stock rotation privileges between and even though we are not contractually obligated to do so 
each month we adjust the sales reserve for the estimated stock rotation privilege anticipated to be utilized by our distributors 
from time to time  customers may request to return parts for various reasons including the customers belief that the parts are not performing to specification 
many such return requests are the result of customers incorrectly using the parts  not because the parts are defective 
our management reviews these requests and  if approved  we establish a rma 
we are only obligated to accept returns of defective parts 
for customer convenience  we may approve a particular return request  even though we are not obligated to do so 
each month  we record a sales reserve for the approved rmas that have not yet been returned 
in the past  we have not kept a general warranty reserve because historically valid warranty returns  which are the result of a part not meeting specifications or being non functional  have been immaterial and frequently we can resell parts to other customers for use in other applications 
we monitor and assess rma activity and overall materiality to assess whether a general warranty reserve has become appropriate 
we grant price protection solely at the discretion of our management 
the purpose of price protection is to reduce our distributors cost of inventory as market prices fall  which reduces our ssd rates 
our sales management team prepares price protection proposals for individual products located at individual distributors 
our general management reviews these proposals and if a particular price protection arrangement is approved  we estimate the dollar impact based on the book price reduction per unit for the products approved and the number of units of those products in that distributor s inventory 
we record a sales reserve in that period for the estimated amount at the time revenue is recognized 
at the discretion of our management  we may offer rebates on specific products sold to specific end customers 
the purpose of the rebates is to allow for pricing adjustments for large programs without affecting the pricing we charge our distributor customers 
we record the customer s rebate at the time of shipment 
customers are typically granted payment terms of between and days and they generally pay within those terms 
we grant relatively few customers any sales terms that include cash discounts 
we invoice our distributors for shipments at our listed book price 
when our distributors pay those invoices  they may claim debits for ssds  stock rotations  cash discounts  rmas and price protection when appropriate 
once claimed  we confirm these debits are in line with our management s prior authorizations and reduce the reserve we previously established for that customer 
the revenue we record for sales to our distributors is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience rates  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current trends and other related factors 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to make reliable estimates and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and in banks and all highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase 
short and long term investments 
our policy is to invest excess funds in instruments with investment grade credit ratings 
we classify our investments as available for sale 
further  we classify our available for sale securities as either current or non current based on the specific attributes of each security 
we recognize unrealized gains and losses in our available for sale securities as an increase or reduction in shareholders equity 
we report our available for sale securities at their fair values 
we evaluate our available for sale securities for impairment quarterly 
we recognize the credit portion of an impairment loss as other than temporary decline in the value of investment in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which we discover the impairment 
any non credit portion of an impairment loss is recorded in other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheet for the period in which we discover the impairment 
we have also made other investments including loans and bridge loans convertible to equity as well as direct equity investments 
we make these loans and investments with strategic intentions and  historically  are in privately held technology companies  which by their nature are high risk 
these investments are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet and we carry them at the lower of cost or market if the investment has experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
we monitor these investments quarterly and make appropriate reductions in carrying value if we deem a decline in value is other than temporary 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors 
we record a specific allowance in cases where we become aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to pay fully their financial obligation to us 
for all other customers  we recognize an allowance based on the length of time the receivable balances are past due  based on the current economic environment and our historical experience 
inventories 
for our ic and certain fcp products we record inventories at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we adjust the carrying value of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory based on inventory age  shipment history and our forecast of demand over a specific future period 
the semiconductor markets that we serve are volatile and actual results may vary from our forecast or other assumptions  potentially affecting our assessment of excess and obsolete inventory resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
we record the inventories of the remainder of our fcp products at the lower of weighted average cost which approximates actual cost or market value 
weighted average cost is comprised of average manufacturing costs weighted by the volume produced in each production run 
we define market value as the net realizable value for our finished goods and replacement cost for raw materials and work in process 
we consider raw material inventory slow moving and fully reserve for it if it has not moved in days 
for assembled devices  we disaggregate the inventory by part number 
we compare the quantities on hand in each part number category to the quantity we shipped in the previous twelve months  the quantity in backlog and to the quantity we expect to ship in the next twelve months 
we record a reserve to the extent the value of each quantity on hand is in excess of the lesser of the three comparisons 
in certain circumstances  management will determine  based on expected usage or other factors  that inventory considered excess by these guidelines should not be reserved 
the company does occasionally determine that last twelve months sales levels will not continue and reserves inventory in line with the quantity forecasted 
we believe our method of evaluating our inventory fairly represents market conditions 
we consider the reserved material to be available for sale 
we do not revalue the reserved inventory should market conditions change or if a market develops for the obsolete inventory 
in the past  we have sold obsolete inventory that we have previously fully reserved 
refer to the gross profit discussion in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion of sales of our obsolete inventory 
property  plant and equipment 
we record our property  plant and equipment at cost and depreciate the cost over the estimated useful lives of each asset classification  ranging between and years 
cost includes purchase cost  applicable taxes  freight  installation costs and interest incurred in the acquisition of any asset that requires a period of time to make it ready for use 
in addition  we capitalize the cost of major replacements  improvements and betterments  while we expense normal maintenance and repair 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
we hold and have held ownership interests in various investees 
our ownership in these affiliates has varied from to approximately  which we classify as investments in unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated balance sheets 
we account for long term investments in companies in which we have an ownership share larger than and in which we have significant influence over the activities of the investee using the equity method 
we recognize our proportionate share of each investee s income or loss in the period in which the investee reports the income or loss 
we eliminate all intercompany transactions in accounting for our equity method investments 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles require that we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each to its carrying value 
in general  our reporting units are one step below the segment level 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  and future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
the company bases these fair value estimates on reasonable assumptions but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  the company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we determined that our goodwill was fully impaired at june  and wrote off the balance of million balance during the fourth quarter 
we determined that no impairment of our other indefinite lived intangible assets existed at june  we also evaluate other definite lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we determined that no impairment for these other definite lived intangible assets existed at june  share based compensation 
the company recognizes employee share based compensation through measurement at grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the fair value is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period 
see note for further discussion of share based compensation 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to recording deferred taxes 
our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that will result in deductible amounts in future years  including net operating loss carry forwards 
based on estimates  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
if  in the future  we experience losses for a sustained period of time  we may not be able to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
if this occurs  we may be required to increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
our income tax calculations are based on application of the respective us federal  state or foreign tax laws 
our tax filings  however  are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities 
accordingly  we recognize tax liabilities based on its estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different than the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
we are currently under an internal revenue service examination of our federal tax returns for fiscal and overview we incorporated pericom semiconductor corporation in june in california 
we completed our first profitable fiscal year on june  we design  develop and market high performance integrated circuits and frequency control products used in many of today s advanced electronic systems 
our first volume sales occurred in fiscal and consisted exclusively of volt bit interface logic circuits 
we have introduced new products to the market every year since we produced our first shipments 
in recent years  we have expanded our product offering by introducing the following products  among others in fiscal  we introduced a total of new products across the signal conditioning  timing  and connectivity product areas  including products were introduced across our signal conditioning line of redriver product families supporting the latest high speed serial protocols such as pci express gen  sata  sas  usb  and display port 
products were introduced across our various families of connectivity products  including assp switches  pci express bridges  usb charging solutions  and graphics display switches  offering support for pci express  thunderbolt  usb  hdmi  display port  and other high speed serial protocols 
products were introduced across our various timing product lines  including silicon clock  xo  and clock buffer families  supporting next generation high speed protocol jitter requirements as well as multi output timing products 
in fiscal  we introduced a total of new products across the signal conditioning  timing  and connectivity product areas  including products were introduced across our signal conditioning line of redriver product families supporting the latest high speed serial protocols such as pci express  gbe  sata  sas  usb  and display port 
products were introduced across our various families of connectivity products  including pci express packet switches  usb mobile charging solutions  mcu and mps supervisory products  and high speed analog switches for pci express  thunderbolt  display port  ddr  and other high speed serial protocols 
products were introduced across our various timing product lines  including crystal  vcxo  tcxo  multiple output clock generators  multiple output xo  and pci express xo  clock generator and buffer solutions offering extremely low jitter performance 
in fiscal  we introduced a total of new products across the signal conditioning  timing  and connectivity product areas  including products were introduced across our signal conditioning line including new sata  sas  usb  hdmi  dp  gb ethernet  and pcie redriver products 
products were introduced across our various families of connectivity products  including new power management load switches  gb thunderbolt  gb usb  usb  and gb pcie high performance analog switches  new pcie gen packet switches  mps supervisory  and hiflex assp ic s 
products were introduced across our various timing product lines  including new tcxo  vcxo  and tcvcxo families  specialized very low jitter xo  hiflex family of clock generators  buffers  pcie clock generators  and an embedded clock family 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we expect selling prices for our products to decline over the life of each product 
our ability to increase net revenues is highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of existing products 
in order to have sufficient supply for increased unit sales  we seek to increase the wafer fabrication capacity allocations from our existing foundries  qualify new foundries  increase the number of die per wafer through die size reductions and improve the yields of good die through the implementation of advanced process technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
magnachip  tsmc and globalfoundries manufactured over of the wafers for our semiconductor products in fiscal years  and  with the balance coming from between two and five other suppliers 
declining selling prices will adversely affect gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with the sale of new  higher margin products or achieve commensurate reductions in unit costs 
we seek to improve our overall gross margin through the development and introduction of selected new products that we believe will ultimately achieve higher gross margins 
a higher gross margin for a new product is typically not achieved until some period after the initial introduction of the product  that is  after start up expenses for that product have been incurred and once volume production begins 
in general  costs are higher at the introduction of a new product due to the use of a more generalized design schematic  lower economies of scale in the assembly phase and lower die yield 
our ability to reduce unit cost depends on our ability to shrink the die sizes of our products  improve yields  obtain favorable subcontractor pricing and make in house manufacturing operations more productive and efficient 
there can be no assurance that these efforts  even if successful  will be sufficient to offset declining selling prices 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended june  june  july  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative goodwill impairment total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss from consolidated companies equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates net income loss comparison of fiscal  and net revenues the following table sets forth our revenues and the customer concentrations with respect to such revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands june  june  change june  july  change net revenues percentage of net revenues accounted for by top direct customers number of direct customers that each account for more than of net revenues percentage of net revenues accounted for by top end customers number of end customers that each account for more than of net revenues direct customers include distributors  contract manufacturers and oems 
end customers are oems and their products are manufactured using the company s products 
end customers may purchase directly from the company or from distributors or contract manufacturers 
for end customer sales data  we rely on information provided by our direct distribution and contract manufacturing customers 
net revenues consist of product sales  which we generally recognize upon shipment  less an estimate for returns and allowances 
our order backlog stood at million as of june  and million as of june  we expect to fulfill most of our backlogged orders as of june  within the first quarter of fiscal we remain heavily reliant on orders that book and ship in the same quarter turns orders 
our reliance on turns orders  the uncertain strength of our end markets and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy make it difficult to predict near term demand 
net revenue decreased million or in fiscal versus primarily as the result of a decrease of million or in sales of our ic products to million  which included million from the acquisition of pti  partially offset by a  increase in sales of fcp products to million  for a increase 
these sales decreases are primarily the result of declines in unit sales volumes of existing products  as opposed to price decreases  and occurred for the most part in the markets for pc s and notebook computers 
net revenue decreased million or in fiscal versus primarily as the result of a decrease of million or in sales of our ic products to million  which included million from the acquisition of pti  and a million decrease in sales of fcp products to million  for a decline 
these sales decreases are primarily the result of declines in unit sales volumes of existing products  as opposed to price decreases 
for the years ended june  and june   gross revenues were impacted by sales reserves in the amount of million and million  respectively 
in the future  market conditions could become more difficult as other companies compete more aggressively for business 
pricing for our higher margin ic analog switch  clock and connect products  many of which are proprietary  is more stable  and new product introductions and cost reductions generally offset price declines 
the following table sets forth net revenues by country as a percentage of total net revenues for the fiscal years ended june   june  and july  fiscal year ended in thousands june  june  july  net sales to countries china including hong kong taiwan united states others less than each total net sales over the past three years  sales to china and taiwan have constituted the majority of our sales 
we expect this trend will continue in the future 
gross profit fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands june  june  change june  july  change net revenues gross profit gross profit percentage the  decrease in gross profit in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily the result of a decrease in sales  which led to million of decreased gross profit  partially offset by higher margins at  due primarily to a higher margin product mix  resulting in a million increase in gross profit 
the million decrease in gross profit in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily the result of a decrease in sales  which led to million of decreased gross profit  partially offset by higher margins at  resulting in a million increase in gross profit 
during fiscal years  and  gross profits and gross margins benefited from the sale of inventory  previously valued at   and  respectively  that we had previously identified as excess and reserved 
future gross profit and gross margin are highly dependent on the level and product mix included in net revenues 
this includes the mix of sales between lower margin fcp products and our higher margin integrated circuit products 
although we have been successful at favorably improving our integrated circuit product mix and penetrating new end markets  there can be no assurance that this will continue 
accordingly  we are not able to predict future gross profit levels or gross margins with certainty 
research and development fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands june  june  change june  july  change net revenues research and development r d as a percentage of net revenues research and development r d expenses consist primarily of costs related to personnel and overhead  non recurring engineering charges and other costs associated with the design  prototyping and testing of new product concepts  manufacturing process support and customer applications support 
the approximately  expense decrease for fiscal as compared with fiscal is primarily attributable to decreases of  for masks  assembly  design consultants and freight expenditures   in depreciation and amortization charges  and  in facilities related expenses  partially offset by increased compensation expenses of  the approximately million expense increase for fiscal as compared with fiscal is primarily attributable to increases of  for masks and assembly expenditures   for design consultants and other outside services and  in facilities related expenses 
we believe that continued investment in research and development to develop new products and improve manufacturing processes is critical to our success and  consequently  we expect to increase research and development expenses in future periods over the long term 
selling  general and administrative fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands june  june  change june  july  change net revenues selling  general and administrative sg a as a percentage of net revenues selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  administration  human resources and general management 
the  expense decrease for fiscal as compared with fiscal is primarily attributable to decreases of  of notes receivable write offs and  in recruiting expenses  partially offset by increases of  in facilities expenses   in compensation related expenses and  in outside accounting services related to the realignment of our operational transactions to more closely match our global presence 
the  expense increase for fiscal as compared with fiscal is attributable to  of notes receivable write offs and increases of  in recruiting expenses  partially offset by an  reduction in compensation related expenses including share based compensation charges 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as we add to our support and administrative staff  particularly in sales and marketing  and as we face increasing commission expense to the extent we achieve higher sales levels 
we intend to continue to focus on controlling selling  general and administrative expenses 
goodwill impairment we test goodwill for impairment annually 
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds its fair value  then the second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 
the fiscal goodwill impairment analysis resulted in an impairment charge of million  in which we wrote off the goodwill associated with the acquisition of pti in and pericom taiwan limited in this was based on a combination of factors including a decline in the net present value of expected future cash flows from our three reporting units as well as a decline in our market capitalization 
there was no goodwill impairment for the years ended june  and july  interest and other income  net fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands june  june  change june  july  change net revenues interest income other income  n m total interest and other income  net n m means not meaningful 
the  increase in other income for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily the result of a  increase in currency exchange gains and a  increase in other income 
the decrease in interest income including realized gains for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily the result of a million decrease in realized gains from the sale of investment securities 
other income for fiscal included an million gain on shares of pti held prior to the acquisition 
interest expense interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of reduced levels of debt outstanding during the year 
there was no debt outstanding at the end of fiscal interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily because fiscal included the interest accretion of  on the pti contingent earn out liability and the interest on short term debt incurred to finance a portion of the pti acquisition 
provision for income taxes fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands june  june  change june  july  change pre tax income loss income tax provision effective tax rate our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes  the effect of foreign income tax and foreign losses  the utilization of research and development tax credits and changes in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the income tax provision for fiscal increased from fiscal primarily as a result of our implementation of an operating structure to more efficiently align our transaction flows with our geographic business operations 
with revenues from non us regions accounting for over of all revenues and with nearly all of our suppliers located in the asia pacific region  we realigned our operating entities and completed an intercompany transfer of intellectual property rights  resulting in a taxable gain in the us for which we booked a million income tax provision 
further  the pre tax loss in fiscal is primarily the result of the million charge for goodwill impairment  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal increased from fiscal primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance of million 
this resulted from the establishment of a million deferred tax asset valuation allowance relating to california tax credits that are not more likely than not to be utilized in the future  with the balance from increases in net operating losses generated in non us subsidiaries

at june   unrealized losses on marketable securities  net of taxes were  when assessing marketable securities for other than temporary declines in value  we consider a number of factors 
our analyses of the severity and duration of price declines  portfolio manager reports  economic forecasts and the specific circumstances of issuers indicate that it is reasonable to expect marketable securities with unrealized losses at june  to recover in fair value up to our cost basis within a reasonable period of time 
we have the ability and intent to hold investments with unrealized losses until maturity  when the obligors are required to redeem them at full face value or par  and we believe the obligors have the financial resources to redeem the debt securities

recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 topic intangibles goodwill and other  which amends topic to allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value 
an entity is not required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible unless the entity determines  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than the carrying value 
this standard is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  and early adoption is permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption will have an impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this guidance is the culmination of the fasb s deliberation on reporting reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
the amendments in asu do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income 
however  the amendments require disclosure of amounts reclassified out of aoci in its entirety  by component  on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes thereto 
amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income must be cross referenced to other disclosures that provide additional detail 
this standard is effective prospectively for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not have an impact on the company s financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 income taxes topic presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists 
asu provides guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  similar tax loss  or tax credit carryforward exists 
this new standard requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits utbs against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions 
utbs will be netted against all available same jurisdiction loss or other tax carryforwards that would be utilized  rather than only against carryforwards that are created by the utbs 
asu will be effective for annual reporting periods  and interim reporting periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
since asu only impacts financial statement disclosure requirements for unrecognized tax benefits  the company does not expect its adoption to have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure at june   the company s investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash equivalents  with fair value of million see note of notes to financial statements 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
we could realize a loss on these securities if we were forced to sell them in a period when interest rates are higher than current rates 
we do not expect such a scenario to occur 
for example  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   such as from to  the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would be approximately million 
on the other hand  if interest rates were to decline the effect on our portfolio would be in the opposite direction 
when the general economy weakens significantly  as it did in and  the credit profile  financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate  and our interest bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily 
we may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk return trade offs that do not perform well 
at june   we held a significant portion of our corporate cash in diversified portfolios of investment grade marketable securities  mortgage and asset backed securities  and other securities that had net unrealized gains of  net of tax 
although we consider unrealized gains and losses on individual securities to be temporary  there is a risk that we may incur other than temporary impairment charges if credit and equity markets are unstable and adversely impact securities issuers 
the company transacts business in various non us currencies  primarily the new taiwan dollar  the hong kong dollar and the chinese renminbi 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on accounts receivable and accounts payable from sales and purchases in these foreign currencies and the net monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries 
a hypothetical unfavorable change in the foreign currency exchange rate would reduce cash by approximately million as those monetary assets are converted to cash
