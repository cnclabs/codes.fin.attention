asset liability management our primary asset liability management goal is to optimize long term net interest income opportunities within the constraints of managing interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity and funding and maintaining a strong capital base 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or repricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
we regularly review our interest rate sensitivity  and use a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management and the board of directors 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of our primary strategies to accomplish this objective 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed using a number of methods including by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring our interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a defined period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a defined period 
for additional information related to interest rate sensitivity  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the repricing and maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities at december  are shown in the following table less than one year one to five years over five years total dollars in thousands interest rate sensitive assets commercial loans real estate loans mortgage backed securities consumer loans investment securities loans held for sale 
table of contents less than one year one to five years over five years total dollars in thousands interest rate sensitive liabilities money market and interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits retail certificates of deposits ira certificates of deposit jumbo certificates of deposit brokered certificates of deposit fhlb advances trust preferred borrowings senior debt other borrowed funds total interest sensitive liabilities deficiency excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate liabilities interest rate sensitive gap one year interest rate sensitive assets interest rate sensitive liabilities one year interest rate sensitive gap as a percent of total assets includes commercial mortgage  construction  and residential mortgage loans loan balances exclude nonaccruing loans  deferred fees and costs the table shows a deficiency of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate liabilities for less than one year which reflects the early stages of a program to deleverage our balance sheet by million in mbs  which began during the fourth quarter of as of december   we had completed only approximately million of the mbs reduction  with the remainder completed during the first quarter of we currently have a preference towards a neutral to slightly asset sensitive one year gap position at this time 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling rates  a positive gap would result in a decrease in net interest income while a negative gap would augment net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities which contractually reprice within the rate period may not  reprice at the same price  at the same time or with the same frequency 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
variations can occur as we adjust our interest sensitivity position throughout the year 
to provide a more accurate position of our one year gap  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest rate sensitive attributes and not on the contractual repricing characteristics of these deposits 
for the purpose of this analysis  we estimate  based on historical trends of our deposit accounts  that of our money market deposits  of our interest bearing demand deposits and of our savings deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes 
accordingly  these interest sensitive portions are classified in the less than one year category with the remainder in the over five years category 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable 
changes in deposit rates are generally subject to local market conditions and our discretion and are not indexed to any particular rate 

table of contents reverse mortgages we hold an investment in reverse mortgages of  at december  representing a second lien participation in reverse mortgages with a third party 
these loans were originated in the early s 
these reverse mortgage loans are contracts that require the lender to make monthly advances throughout each borrower s life or until each borrower relocates  prepays or the home is sold  at which time the loan becomes due and payable 
reverse mortgages are nonrecourse obligations  which means that the loan repayments are generally limited to the net sale proceeds of the borrower s residence 
we account for our investment in reverse mortgages by estimating the value of the future cash flows on the reverse mortgages at a rate deemed appropriate for these mortgages  based on the market rate for similar collateral 
actual cash flows from these mortgage loans can result in volatility in the recorded value of reverse mortgage assets 
as a result  income varies significantly from reporting period to reporting period 
for the year ended december   we recorded a positive  in interest income on reverse mortgages as compared to a negative  in and a negative  in the results for reflect an improvement in housing prices during the year 
the decrease in the prior two years were due to the drop in the property values securing these mortgages  which were based on annual re evaluation and are generally consistent with the decrease in home values over the past three years 
the projected cash flows depend on assumptions about life expectancy of the mortgagees and the future changes in collateral values 
projecting the changes in collateral values is one of the factors affecting the volatility of reverse mortgage values 
the current assumptions include a short term annual depreciation rate of zero in the first year  and a long term annual appreciation rate of in future years 
if the long term appreciation rate was increased or decreased by  the impact on income would not be material 
we also hold million fair value in bbb rated mbs classified as trading securities 
further  we own class o certificates issued in connection with securities consisting of a portfolio of reverse mortgages we previously owned 
as of december   the market value of these securities was million 
third party model uses the income approach as described in asc the model is a present value cash flow model  consistent with asc which describes the components of a present value measurement 
the model incorporates the projected cash flows of the notes and then discounts these cash flows using a rate that is commensurate with the risk adjusted rate 
the inputs to the model reflect our expectations of what other market participants would use in pricing this asset in a current transaction and therefore is consistent with asc that sets out an exit price methodology for determining fair value 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate  assets acquired through foreclosure and restructured mortgage and home equity consumer debt 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal and interest 
past due loans are defined as loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because they are considered well secured and in the process of collection 

table of contents the following table shows our nonperforming assets and past due loans at the dates indicated at december  dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans commercial owner occupied commercial commercial mortgages construction residential mortgages consumer total nonaccruing loans assets acquired through foreclosure restructured loans total nonperforming assets past due loans residential mortgages commercial and commercial mortgages consumer total past due loans ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of loan loss allowance to nonaccruing loans prior to  owner occupied commercial loans were included in commercial loans

total loans exclude loans held for sale 
nonperforming assets decreased million between december  and december  as a result  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to at december  from at december  this significant reduction was bolstered by the successful efforts of our asset strategies during the second quarter of this strategy included a bulk loan sale which resulted in the sale of million of problem loans  including million of nonperforming loans 
in addition  another million was collected or paid down through additional note sales and ongoing asset management activities during lastly and partially offsetting these decreases  as the result of recent occ guidance regarding chapter bankruptcy loans during  million of loans were reclassified from performing loans to nonaccrual status consisting of million of residential mortgages and million of consumer loans 
the following table provides an analysis of the change in the balance of nonperforming assets during the last three years year ended december  in thousands beginning balance additions collections collections from loan dispositions transfers to accrual charge offs write downs ending balance 
table of contents the timely identification of problem loans is a key element in our strategy to manage our loan portfolio 
timely identification enables us to take appropriate action and  accordingly  minimize losses 
an asset review system established to monitor the asset quality of our loans and investments in real estate portfolios facilitates the identification of problem assets 
in general  this system utilizes guidelines established by federal regulation 
at december   we did not have a material amount of loans which had not been classified as non accrual  days past due or restructured but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused us to have serious concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and may result in disclosure as non accrual  days past due or restructured 
as of december   we had million of loans which  although performing at that date  required increased supervision and review 
they may  depending on the economic environment and other factors  become nonperforming assets in future periods 
the amount of such loans at december  was million 
the majority of these loans are secured by commercial real estate  with others being secured by residential real estate  inventory and receivables 
allowance for loan losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses and charge losses to this allowance when such losses are realized 
we established our loan loss allowance in accordance with guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment reflecting our best estimate of impairment related to specifically identified impaired loans as well as probable loan losses in the remaining loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon a continuing review of these portfolios 
for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses of million at december  decreased million from million at december  in addition  the ratio of allowance to loan losses to total gross loans was at december   compared to at december  these decreases reflect the following items a decrease in problem loans all criticized  classified and nonperforming loans total problem loans improved to of tier capital plus the allowance for loan losses at december   compared to at december   reflecting favorable risk rating migration  problem asset disposition efforts  and prudent credit management

historically  we have had success in growing our loan portfolio 
for example  during the year ended december   net loan growth resulted in the use of million in cash 
loan growth was primarily the result of our continued success increasing corporate and small business lending 
we expect this trend to continue and have significant experience managing our funding needs through borrowings and deposit growth 
as a financial institution  we have ready access to several sources of funding 
among these are core deposits brokered deposits borrowing from the fhlb federal reserve discount window access other borrowings such as repurchase agreements cash flow from securities  loan sales and repayments net income our branch expansion and renovation program over the last few years has been focused on expanding our retail footprint in delaware and the surrounding area and attracting new customers in part to provide additional deposit growth 
customer deposit growth deposits excluding brokered cds increased million  or  from december  to december  all of this growth was in core deposit accounts and was partially offset by a decrease in customer time and sweep accounts 
our portfolio of high quality liquid investments  primarily mbs and gse securities also provide a source of cash flow to meet current cash needs in addition to normal cash flows from paydowns in these securities 
if needed  portions of this portfolio  as well as portions of the loan portfolio  could be sold to provide cash to fund new loans 
in addition  during the year ended december   million in cash was provided by operating activities 
we have a policy that separately addresses liquidity  and we monitor our adherence to policy limits 
as part of the liquidity management process  we also monitor our available wholesale funding capacity 
at december  
table of contents  we had million in funding capacity at the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
during late we prepaid million of fhlb advances with an average rate of 
also  liquidity risk management is a primary area of examination by the banking regulators 
we have not used  and have no intention of using  any significant off balance sheet financing arrangement for liquidity management purposes 
our financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are limited to obligations to fund loans to customers pursuant to existing commitments  obligations of letters of credit and swap guarantees 
in addition  we have not had  and have no intention of having  any significant transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities that could materially affect our liquidity or capital resources 
capital resources under guidelines issued by banking regulators  savings institutions such as the bank must maintain tangible capital equal to of adjusted total assets  core capital equal to of adjusted total assets  tier capital equal to of risk weighted assets and total or risk based capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial statements 
in light of the current economic conditions  we hold a capital cushion well in excess of these limits 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as well as other requirements  established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized  and critically under capitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier depends upon its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures  which include leverage and risk based capital measures and certain other factors 
depository institutions that are not classified as well capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions  payment of management fees  acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities 
at december   we were classified as well capitalized  the highest regulatory defined level  and in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements 
additional information concerning our regulatory capital compliance is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
since  the board of directors has approved several stock repurchase programs to acquire common stock outstanding 
we did not acquire any shares in or at december   we held million shares of our common stock as treasury shares 
at december   we had  shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorization 
in  under the us treasury s capital purchase plan cpp  we issued and sold  shares of senior preferred stock to the us treasury  having a liquidation amount equal to  per share  or million  as well as a year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of 
in  the treasury held a public auction where it sold its entire preferred stock holding in us

contractual obligations at december   we had contractual obligations relating to operating leases  long term debt  data processing and credit obligations 
these obligations are summarized below

the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same extent as the price of goods and services 
recent legislation in  the president signed the dodd frank act into law 
this legislation makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires significant rule making 
in addition  the legislation mandates multiple studies  which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action 
while the full effects of the legislation on us cannot yet be determined  this legislation was opposed by the american bankers association and is generally perceived as negatively impacting the banking industry 
this legislation may result in higher compliance and other costs  reduced revenues and higher capital and liquidity requirements  among other things  which could adversely affect our business 
there are many parts of the dodd frank act that have yet to be determined and implemented however  as a direct result of the act  the following rulings have been adopted or will be adopted in the coming years on august  the board of directors of the fdic adopted a final ruling permanently increasing the standard maximum deposit insurance amount from  to  which became effective on july  during january of  a timeframe and preliminary implementation plan for the phase out of the office of thrift supervision the ots  one of our current banking regulators was announced by the joint agencies  and its merger into the office of the comptroller of the currency 
the provisions of the plan included a transition from the thrift financial report  to the call report  and began with the march reporting period 

table of contents on february   the federal reserve approved a final ruling the changes the deposit insurance fund dif assessment from domestic deposits to average assets minus tangible equity 
the changes went into effect during the second quarter of and were payable at the end of september 
it is the intent of the fdic that banks with over billion in assets pay a larger share of the assessments into the dif 
in june  the federal reserve adopted the durbin amendment in which debit interchange fees would be capped at cents plus basis points of the transaction  with the possibility of an additional cent if the issuer implements certain fraud prevention standards 
this rule affects banks with billion or more in assets 
on july   the federal reserve repealed federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits 
on july   the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb was created to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection 
the bureau has been given the responsibility for implementing  examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws 
on june   the federal reserve approved proposed rules that would substantially amend the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to the company and the bank 
the fdic and the occ subsequently approved these proposed rules on june  the proposed rules implement the basel iii regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the dodd frank act 
basel iii refers to two consultative documents released by the basel committee on banking supervision in december  the rules text released in december  and loss absorbency rules issued in january  which include significant changes to bank capital  leverage and liquidity requirements 
the proposed rules received extensive comments during a comment period that ran through october in november  the federal bank regulatory agencies jointly stated that they do not expect any of the proposed rules to become effective on the original target date of january  further guidance from the bank regulatory agencies is expected in early the proposed rules include new risk based capital and leverage ratios  which would be phased in from to  and would refine the definition of what constitutes capital for purposes of calculating those ratios 
the proposed new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the company and the bank under the proposals would be i a new common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of increased from  iii a total capital ratio of unchanged from current rules  and iv a tier leverage ratio of for all institutions 
the proposed rules would also establish a capital conservation buffer of above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements  which must consist entirely of common equity tier capital and would result in the following minimum ratios i a common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of  and iii a total capital ratio of 
the new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in january at of risk weighted assets and would increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in january an institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends  engaging in share repurchases  and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount 
these limitations would establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions 
basel iii provided discretion for regulators to impose an additional buffer  the countercyclical buffer  of up to of common equity tier capital to take into account the macro financial environment and periods of excessive credit growth 
however  the proposed rules permit the countercyclical buffer to be applied only to advanced approach banks ie  banks with billion or more in total assets or billion or more in total foreign exposures  which currently excludes the company and the bank 
the proposed rules also implement revisions and clarifications consistent with basel iii regarding the various components of tier capital  including common equity  unrealized gains and losses  as well as certain instruments that will no longer qualify as tier capital  some of which would be phased out over time 

table of contents the federal bank regulatory agencies also proposed revisions to the prompt corrective action framework  which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions  including the bank  if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness 
these revisions would take effect january  under the prompt corrective action requirements  which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer  insured depository institutions would be required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as well capitalized i a new common equity tier capital ratio of  ii a tier capital ratio of increased from  iii a total capital ratio of unchanged from current rules  and iv a tier leverage ratio of increased from 
the proposed rules set forth certain changes for the calculation of risk weighted assets  which we would be required to utilize beginning january  the standardized approach proposed rule utilizes an increased number of credit risk exposure categories and risk weights  and also addresses i a proposed alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with section a of the dodd frank act act  ii revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation  iii rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans  iv revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo style transactions  and v disclosure requirements for top tier banking organizations with billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the advance approach rules that apply to banks with greater than billion in consolidated assets 
based on our current capital composition and levels  we believe that we would be in compliance with the requirements as set forth in the proposed rules if they were presently in effect 
on december   unlimited fdic insurance on certain noninterest bearing transaction accounts under the transaction account guarantee program expired 
under this program  prior to its expiration  all funds in a noninterest bearing transaction account were insured in full by the fdic from december   through december  this temporary unlimited coverage was in addition to  and separate from  the coverage of at least  available to depositors under the fdic s general deposit insurance rules 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions including those related to the allowance for loan losses  deferred taxes  fair value measurements  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are critical accounting policies that involve more significant judgments and estimates 
for additional information on these policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses we maintain allowances for loan losses and charge losses to these allowances when realized 
we consider the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be critical because it requires significant judgment reflecting our best estimate of impairment related to specifically evaluated impaired loans as well as the inherent risk of loss for those in the remaining loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon a continuing review of the portfolio  with consideration given to evaluations resulting from examinations performed by regulatory authorities 

table of contents deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes asc  which requires the recording of deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we consider our accounting policies on deferred taxes to be critical because we regularly assess the need for valuation allowances on deferred income tax assets that may result from  among other things  limitations imposed by internal revenue code and uncertainties  including the timing of settlement and realization of these differences 
no valuation allowance was required as of december  fair value measurements we adopted fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures asc  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we consider our accounting policies related to fair value measurements to be critical because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require our subjective and complex judgment as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
see note  fair value of financial assets to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets resulting from acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting consist of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized and is subject to at least annual assessments for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we review goodwill annually and again at any quarter end if a material event occurs during the quarter that may affect goodwill 
this review evaluates potential impairment by determining if our fair value has fallen below carrying value 
other intangible assets consist mainly of core deposits and covenants not to compete obtained through acquisitions and are amortized over their estimated lives using the present value of the benefit of the core deposits and straight line methods of amortization 
core deposit intangibles are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued an update asu no 
 reconsideration of effective control in repurchase agreements which removes from the assessment of effective control  the criterion related to the transferor s ability to repurchase or redeem financial assets on substantially agreed terms  even in the event of default by the transferee 
in addition  this guidance also eliminates the requirement to demonstrate that a transferor possesses adequate collateral to fund substantially all the cost of purchasing replacement financial assets 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december   and applies prospectively to transactions or modifications of existing transactions occurring on or after the effective date 
the adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued an update asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between us and international accounting principles 
while the overall guidance is consistent with us gaap  the amendment includes additional fair value disclosure requirements 
the amendments in the guidance are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued an update asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income to eliminate the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholder s equity 
the amendment requires that comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement or in two separate consecutive statements 
this amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we chose to adopt the two separate consecutive statements presentation  which did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued an update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment to give entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the first step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
this amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  for the year ended december   we completed a full analysis of our goodwill for impairment  therefore the adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an update asu no 
 balance sheet topic offsetting to address balance sheet offsetting 
an entity is required to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements so that users of the financial statements can understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position

the instruments and transactions include derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending arrangements

concerns were raised that reclassifications of items out of aoci would be costly for prepares and may add unnecessary complexity to financial statements 
all other requirements in asu are not affected by this update 
this amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued an update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment which permits entities to perform an optional qualitative assessment for determining whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  we are evaluating the impact of asu  however  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued an update asu  balance sheet topic clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the asu amends update to clarify that the scope applies to derivatives  repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with section or section or subject to master netting or similar arrangements 
other types of financial assets and liabilities subject to master netting 
table of contents or similar arrangements are not subject to the disclosure requirements in update the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
we are evaluating the impact of asu  however  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the matching of maturities or repricing periods of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to promote a favorable interest rate spread and mitigate exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is our primary tool for achieving our asset liability management strategies 
we regularly review our interest rate sensitivity and adjust the sensitivity within our acceptable tolerance ranges 
at december  interest earning liabilities exceeded interest bearing assets that mature or reprice within one year interest sensitive gap by approximately million 
our interest sensitive assets as a percentage of interest sensitive liabilities within one year decreased from at december  to at december  likewise  the one year interest sensitive gap as a percentage of total assets changed to at december  from at december  the change in sensitivity since december  was the result of the current interest rate environment and our continuing effort to effectively manage interest rate risk 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing and funding activities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure 
the following table is the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and economic value of equity at the specified levels at december  and december  december  december  change in interest rate basis points change in net interest margin economic value of equity change in net interest margin economic value of equity nmf nmf nmf nmf nmf nmf nmf nmf the percentage difference between net interest income in a stable interest rate environment and net interest margin as projected under the various rate change environments 
the economic value of equity ratio in a stable interest rate environment and the economic value of equity projected under the various rate change environments 
sensitivity indicated by a decrease of and basis points is deemed not meaningful nmf given the low absolute level of interest rates at that time 

table of contents our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital  while maximizing the yield cost spread on our asset liability structure 
we rely primarily on our asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
we also engage in other business activities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for example  mortgage banking revenues and expenses can fluctuate with changing interest rates 
these fluctuations are difficult to model and estimate
