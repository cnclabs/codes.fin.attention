item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note  accrued insurance claims  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition the specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly fragmented 
it is characterized by a large number of participants  including several large companies as well as a significant number of small  privately owned  local competitors 
we also face competition from the in house service organizations of our existing and prospective customers  particularly telecommunications providers that employ personnel who perform some of the same services that we provide 
we have been performing specialty contracting services through relationships with our subsidiaries that in many cases have existed for decades 
however  our existing and prospective customers may elect to discontinue outsourcing specialty contracting services in the future 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate 
as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor 
a significant portion of our revenue is currently derived from master service agreements  and price is often an important factor in awarding such agreements 
accordingly  we may be underbid by our competitors if they elect to reduce their prices in order to procure business or we could be required to lower the price charged under a contract being rebid 
our competitors may also have or develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services  and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position 
the principal competitive factors for our services include geographic presence  breadth of service offerings  worker and general public safety  price  quality of service  and industry reputation 
we believe that we perform as well as or better than our competitors with respect to these factors 
employees as of july   we employed approximately  persons 
the number of our employees varies with the level of our work in progress 
we maintain a nucleus of technical and managerial personnel to supervise all projects and add employees as needed to complete specific projects 
materials and subcontractors for a majority of the contract services we perform  our customers provide all the materials required while we provide the necessary personnel  tools  and equipment 
materials supplied by our customers  for which the customer retains financial and performance risk  are not included in our revenue or costs of sales 
under contracts where we are required to supply part or all of the materials  we are not generally dependent upon any one source for the materials that we customarily use to complete projects 
we do not manufacture materials for resale 
we use independent subcontractors to help manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amount that we may otherwise be required to spend on fixed assets and working capital 
these independent subcontractors typically are small locally owned companies 
independent subcontractors provide their own employees  vehicles  tools  and insurance coverage 
no single independent subcontractor is significant 

table of contents seasonality our revenues exhibit seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors 
consequently  our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season  which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters 
also  a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter  which decreases the number of available workdays 
additionally  our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period 
as a result  we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal year 
environmental matters a significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers 
we could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event we cause a release of hazardous substances or other environmental damage resulting from underground objects we encounter 
additionally  environmental laws and regulations which relate to our business include those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances 
these laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
costs associated with the discharge of hazardous substances may include clean up costs and related damages or liabilities 
these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described below 
if any of the risks described below  or elsewhere in this annual report on form k  or the company other filings with the securities and exchange commission  were to occur  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
additionally  if other risks not presently known to us  or that we do not currently believe to be significant  occur or become significant  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
uncertain economic conditions and or challenges in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact our customers future spending 
the us economy is still recovering from the recent recession  and growth in us economic activity has remained slow 
it is uncertain when these conditions will significantly improve 
economic downturns adversely impact the demand for our services and potentially result in the delay or cancellation of projects by our customers 
this makes it difficult to estimate our customers requirements for our services and adds uncertainty to the determination of our backlog 
in addition  our customers generally finance their projects though cash flow from operations  the issuance of debt  or the issuance of equity 
as a result  reduced cash flow from operations or volatility in the credit and equity markets could reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for our customers 
this may result in a reduction in our customers spending for our services  which could adversely affect our operations as a result of less demand for our services or lower margins 
demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to downturns affecting the industries we serve 
demand for our services by telecommunications customers has been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the economy and telecommunications industry 
our results for fiscal and fiscal were impacted by customer reductions in near term spending plans 
although we experienced an improved operating environment in fiscal   and  there is no guarantee that future downturns will not occur 
during times of slowing economic conditions  our customers often reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects 
in addition  our underground facility locating services more generally are influenced by the level of overall economic activity 
as a result of the foregoing  demand for our services may decline during periods of economic weakness adversely affecting our operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements and long term contracts which may be canceled by our customers upon notice or which we may be unable to renew on negotiated terms 
during fiscal  we derived approximately of our revenues from master service agreements and long term contracts 
by their terms  the majority of these contracts may be canceled by our customers upon notice  regardless of whether or not we are in default 
in addition  our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us under these agreements 
consequently  projected expenditures by customers are not assured until a definitive work order is placed with us and the work completed 
furthermore  our customers generally require competitive bidding of these contracts 
accordingly  we may be underbid by our competitors if they elect to reduce their prices in order to procure business or we could be required to lower the price charged under a contract being rebid 
the loss of work obtained through master service agreements and long term contracts or the reduced profitability of such work could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
the industries we serve have experienced and may continue to experience rapid technological  structural and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues 
the telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change  intense competition and changing consumer demands 
we generate a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry 
new technologies  or upgrades to existing technologies by customers  could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
new  developing  or existing services could displace the wireline or wireless systems that we install and that are used by our customers to deliver services to consumers and businesses 
in addition  improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunication companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers  and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
our customer base is highly concentrated  with our top five customers accounting for approximately   and of our total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
if we were to lose one or more of our significant customers  our revenue may significantly decline 
in addition  revenues under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period to period depending on the timing or volume of work which those customers order or perform with their in house service organizations 
additionally  the consolidation  merger or acquisition of an existing customer may result in a change in procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity which could reduce the amount of work we receive 
the loss of work from a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 

table of contents the specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
we compete with other specialty contractors  including numerous small  privately owned companies  as well as several companies that may have financial  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization with adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor 
additionally  our competitors may develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services  and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position 
we also face competition from the in house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of the services that we provide 
we can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future 
our financial results are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data 
in some instances  these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings under the percentage of completion method of accounting  allowance for doubtful accounts  the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis  the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets  the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired  accrued insurance claims  income taxes  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense for performance based stock awards  and accruals for contingencies  including legal matters 
at the time they are made  we believe that such estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole 
however  actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
our profitability is based on our delivering services within the estimated costs established when pricing our contracts 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
as the price for each of the units is fixed by the contract  our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each unit exceeds our original estimates 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires that we estimate the costs to be incurred in performing the contract 
our process for estimating costs is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals 
any changes in original cost estimates  or the assumptions underpinning such estimates  may result in changes to costs and income 
these changes would be recognized in the period in which they are determined and could result in significant changes to previously reported profits 
we have a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
we extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing our customers for that work 
these customers include telephone companies  cable television multiple system operators  and gas and electric utilities and others 
at july   we had net accounts receivable of million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of million 
we periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and continuously monitor the timeliness of payments 
slowing conditions in the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all 
furthermore  bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector could hinder the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis or at all 
the failure or delay in payment by our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and profitability 
we retain the risk of loss for certain insurance related liabilities 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
we estimate and develop our accrual for these claims based on facts  circumstances and historical evidence 
however  the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors that cannot be known with precision 
these factors include the estimated number of future claims  the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred  changes in the medical condition of claimants  and other factors such as inflation  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations 
should a greater number of claims occur compared to what we have estimated  or should the dollar amount or cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  and we could incur substantial additional unanticipated charges 
see item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies accrued insurance claims  and note  accrued insurance claims  of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 

table of contents our backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other contracts 
many of our contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and  more generally  our experience in procurements of this type 
revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of project accelerations  cancellations or delays due to various factors  including but not limited to commercial issues and adverse weather 
these factors can also cause revenue amounts to be realized in periods and at levels different than originally projected 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract 
our estimates of a customer requirements during a particular future period may prove to be inaccurate 
as a result  our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenues and earnings 
we may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets 
we account for goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic 
our reporting units goodwill and other related indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed annually as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value 
in addition  they are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests  an impairment loss is recognized 
any such write down adversely affects our results of operations 
our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
as a result of the fiscal annual impairment analysis  the company concluded that no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible asset was indicated at any reporting unit 
for businesses acquired in fiscal  there were no significant changes in forecast assumptions between the initial valuation date and the annual impairment analysis 
as a result  the estimated fair values determined during the fiscal annual impairment analysis approximated the reporting units carrying values for the businesses acquired in fiscal our utiliquest reporting unit  having a goodwill balance of approximately million and an indefinite lived trade name of million  has been at lower operating levels as compared to historical levels 
the fair value of the utiliquest reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by approximately 
the utiliquest reporting unit provides services to a broad range of customers including utilities and telecommunication providers 
these services are required prior to underground excavation and are influenced by overall economic activity  including construction activity 
the goodwill balance of this reporting unit may have an increased likelihood of impairment if a downturn in customer demand were to occur  or if the reporting unit were not able to execute against customer opportunities  and the long term outlook for their cash flows were adversely impacted 
furthermore  changes in the long term outlook for this reporting unit may result in changes to other valuation assumptions 
the profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business  the high level of competition existing within our industry  the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers  and the level of overall economic activity 
individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole 
specifically  during times of slowing economic conditions  our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects 
as a result  demand for the services of one or more of the reporting units could decline which could adversely affect our operations  cash flow  and liquidity  and could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 
we may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings  including fair labor standards act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits  which may adversely affect our business and financial performance 
from time to time  we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions that are brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business 
these actions and proceedings may involve claims for  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  workers compensation  employment discrimination  breach of contract or property damage 
in addition  we may be subject to class action lawsuits involving allegations of violations of the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings 
the outcome of litigation  particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions  is difficult to assess or quantify  because plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts  and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
in addition  plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages  civil penalties  consequential damages or other losses  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
the ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement  mediation or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  regardless of the outcome  these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves 
for a description of current legal proceedings  see item  legal proceedings  and note  commitments and contingencies  of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 

table of contents the loss of certain key managers could adversely affect our business 
we depend on the services of our executive officers and the senior management of our subsidiaries 
our senior management team has many years of experience in our industry  and the loss of any one of them could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations 
although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees  we cannot guarantee that any of them or other key management personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time 
we do not carry significant key person life insurance on any of our employees 
our business is labor intensive  and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 
our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability is limited by our ability to employ  train and retain the skilled personnel necessary to operate our business 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy 
our ability to do so depends on a number of factors  such as general rates of employment  competitive demands for employees possessing the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees 
in addition  our labor costs may increase when there is a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel 
we may be unable to secure sufficient independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations  or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations 
we utilize independent subcontractors to complete work on a portion of our projects 
if we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all  we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase 
in addition  we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from  among other things  the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed 
any of these factors could adversely affect the quality of our service  our ability to perform under certain contracts and the relationship with our customers  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  and liquidity 
higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business  and we may not be able to pass along added costs to customers 
fuel prices fluctuate based on market events outside of our control 
most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term and we may be unable to secure price increases reflecting rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts 
as a result  higher fuel costs may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
although we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases with the use of financial instruments  underlying commodity costs have been volatile in recent periods 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that  at any given time  we will have financial instruments in place to hedge against the impact of increased fuel costs 
to the extent we enter into hedge transactions  declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the financial instruments may require us to make payments which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our results of operations fluctuate seasonally 
our revenues exhibit seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors 
consequently  our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters 
also  a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter  which decreases the number of available workdays 
additionally  our customer premise equipment installation activities historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period 
as a result  we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal year 
we may be unable to generate internal growth 
our internal growth may be affected by  among other factors  our ability to offer the services our existing customers require  attract new customers  and hire and retain qualified employees or independent subcontractors 
many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth  such as the capital budgets of our customers and the availability of qualified employees  may be beyond our control 
should one or more of these factors occur  we may not be able to achieve internal growth  expand our operations or grow our business 
failure to combine and integrate the businesses acquired in fiscal into our operations in a successful and timely manner could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
on december   we acquired substantially all of the telecommunications infrastructure service subsidiaries the acquired subsidiaries of quanta services  inc our integration of the acquired subsidiaries into our operations is a complex and time consuming process which requires significant efforts and expenses 
the difficulties of combining the businesses of the acquired subsidiaries with our operations includes  among others retaining and integrating management and other key employees  unanticipated issues in integrating information  communications and other systems  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures  minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns  and 
table of contents failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company 
these factors could result in increased costs  decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy  which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the purchase of the acquired subsidiaries even if they are successfully integrated into our operations 
we purchased the acquired subsidiaries with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits for the company  including  among others  the strategic strengthening of our customer base  geographic scope  and technical service offerings  as well as the enhancement of our rural telecommunications engineering and construction capabilities 
however  these anticipated benefits may not materialize if we are unable to capitalize on expected business opportunities due to competition or other factors  or general industry and business conditions deteriorate 
if the anticipated benefits of the acquisition are not realized  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement or diversify our business 
we regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
future acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including the diversion of management attention from our existing business  the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business  the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves  and the potential impairment of acquired intangible assets 
our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position may be adversely affected by our ability to successfully integrate any businesses acquired 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in many different jurisdictions of the united states and canada and certain of our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment of income to different jurisdictions 
our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in locations with differing tax rates  the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or tax laws 
an increase to our effective tax rate may increase our tax obligations 
in addition  the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions  and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability 
the indenture under which our senior subordinated notes were issued and our bank credit facility impose restrictions which may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions 
at july   we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of million in senior subordinated notes due the notes 
we also have a credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of banks  which provides for a million term loan the term loan and a million revolving facility  including a sublimit of million for the issuance of letters of credit 
at july   we had million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility  million outstanding under the term loan  and million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit agreement 
the terms of our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things make certain payments  including the payment of dividends  redeem or repurchase our capital stock  incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  make investments or create liens  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  merge or consolidate with another entity  sell certain assets  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
in addition  the credit agreement requires us to comply with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio 
a default under our credit agreement or the indenture governing the notes could result in the acceleration of our obligations under either or both of those agreements as a result of cross acceleration and cross default provisions 
in addition  these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated  and new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for and the profitability of our specialty contracting service 
many of our telecommunications customers are regulated by the federal communications commission fcc 
the fcc may alter its application of current regulations and may impose additional regulations 
if existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our telecommunications customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide  our customers may reduce expenditures which could impact the demand for specialty contracting services 
we may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational health and safety matters 
our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing workplace safety 
our workers frequently operate heavy machinery and work near high voltage lines 
as a result  they and others are subject to potential injury and death 
if any of our workers or any other persons are injured or killed in the course of our operations  we could be found to have violated relevant safety regulations  which could result in a fine or  in extreme cases  criminal sanction 
in addition  if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time  customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business 

table of contents our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
a significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers 
we could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event we cause a release of hazardous substances or other environmental damage resulting from underground objects we encounter 
additionally  the environmental laws and regulations which relate to our business include those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances 
these laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
costs associated with the discharge of hazardous substances may include clean up costs and related damages or liabilities 
these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  new laws and regulations  altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth 
using cash for operational growth  capital expenditures  share repurchases  or acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings 
our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility  including our ability to incur additional debt 
also  if we seek to incur more debt  we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility 
if we pursue additional debt or equity financings  we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our capital expenditures may fluctuate as a result of changes in business requirements 
our anticipated capital expenditure requirements may vary from time to time as a result of changes in our business 
increased capital expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from operations 
increases in our health insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 
the costs of employee health care insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs  legislative changes  and general economic conditions 
additionally  we may incur additional costs as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively  the health care reform laws that were signed into law in march a continued increase in health care costs or additional costs incurred as a result of the health care reform laws could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 
several of our subsidiaries participate in multiemployer pension plans  which under certain circumstances could result in material liabilities being incurred 
a few of our subsidiaries participate in various multiemployer pension plans under union and industry wide agreements that generally provide defined pension benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements 
because of the nature of multiemployer plans  there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single employer plans 
assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that contributing employer 
under the employee retirement income security act  a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable  generally upon withdrawal from a plan  for its proportionate share of the plan unfunded vested liability 
we currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan in which we participate 
however  a future withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate could result in a material withdrawal liability to the extent that any unfunded vested liability under such plan is allocable to the company 
failure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations 
we use our own information technology systems as well as those of our business partners to maintain certain data and provide reports 
our measures protecting these systems may be compromised as a result of third party security breaches  employee error  malfeasance or other irregularity  and may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our or our customers data or accounts 
the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
during fiscal  our common stock fluctuated from a high of per share to a low of per share 
we may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors  including  but not limited to fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions or capital commitments  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts  and the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers demand for our services 

table of contents in addition  factors unrelated to our operating performance  such as market disruptions  industry outlook  general economic conditions  and political events  could decrease the market price of our common stock and  as a result  investors could lose some or all of their investments 
anti takeover provisions of florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our company or a change in our control 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes 
at any annual meeting of our shareholders  our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one third of the directors on our board of directors 
in addition  our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors  without further shareholder approval  to issue up to  shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine 
the issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock  including by the grant of voting control to others 
our by laws also restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders 
lastly  we are subject to certain anti takeover provisions of the florida business corporation act 
these anti takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto  as well as the business and risk factors sections of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services throughout the united states and in canada 
these services include engineering  construction  maintenance and installation services to telecommunications providers  underground facility locating services to various utilities  including telecommunications providers  and other construction and maintenance services to electric and gas utilities and others 
for the fiscal year ended july   the percentage of our revenue by customer type from telecommunications  underground facility locating  and electric and gas utilities and other customers  was approximately   and  respectively 
we conduct operations through our subsidiaries 
our revenues may fluctuate as a result of changes in the capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers  changes in the general level of construction activity  as well as overall economic conditions 
the capital expenditures and maintenance budgets of our telecommunications customers may be impacted by consumer and business demands on telecommunications providers  the introduction of new communication technologies  the physical maintenance needs of their infrastructure  the actions of our government and the federal communications commission  and general economic conditions 
a significant portion of our services are performed under master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that extend for periods of one or more years 
we are party to numerous master service agreements and generally maintain multiple agreements with each of our customers 
master service agreements generally contain customer specified service requirements  such as discrete pricing for individual tasks 
to the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity  there are often a number of exceptions  including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers  perform work with the customer own employees  and use other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility 
in most cases  a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience with written notice 
the remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for specific projects 
long term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date 
short term contracts for specific projects are generally of three to four months in duration 
a portion of our contracts include retainage provisions by which to of the contract invoicing may be withheld by the customer pending project completion 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized as the services are performed 
the following table summarizes our revenues from multi year master service agreements and other long term contracts  as a percentage of contract revenues fiscal year ended multi year master service agreements other long term contracts total long term contracts the percentage of revenue from long term contracts varies from period to period depending on the mix of work performed under our contracts 
during fiscal  a higher percentage of revenue was earned for services performed under short term contracts as compared to the prior two fiscal years  primarily as a result of increased work performed for certain rural 
table of contents broadband customers 
additionally  during fiscal we performed increased work for storm restoration services pursuant to short term contracts 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from several large customers 
the following table reflects the percentage of total revenue from those customers who contributed at least of our total revenue in fiscal   or fiscal year ended at t inc centurylink  inc comcast corporation verizon communications inc windstream corporation charter communications  inc time warner cable inc cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including costs for direct labor provided by employees  services by independent subcontractors  operation of capital equipment excluding depreciation and amortization  direct materials  insurance claims and other direct costs 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our underground facility locating services 
a change in claims experience or actuarial assumptions related to these risks could materially affect our results of operations 
for a majority of the contract services we perform  our customers provide all required materials while we provide the necessary personnel  tools  and equipment 
materials supplied by our customers  for which the customer retains financial and performance risk  are not included in our revenue or costs of sales 
general and administrative expenses include costs of management personnel and administrative overhead at our subsidiaries  as well as our corporate costs 
these costs primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses  including stock based compensation  legal  consulting and professional fees  information technology and development costs  provision for or recoveries of bad debt expense  and other costs that are not directly related to the performance of our services under customer contracts 
in connection with the businesses acquired in fiscal  we recognized approximately million and million of pre tax acquisition and integration costs  respectively  during fiscal which are included within general and administrative expenses 
our senior management  including the senior managers of our subsidiaries  perform substantially all of our sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities and  accordingly  we have not incurred material sales and marketing expenses 
information technology and development costs included in general and administrative expenses are primarily incurred to support and to enhance our operating efficiency 
to protect our rights  we have filed for patents on certain of our innovations 
we are subject to concentrations of credit risk relating primarily to our cash and equivalents  trade accounts receivable  other receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
cash and equivalents primarily include balances on deposit in banks 
we maintain substantially all of our cash and equivalents at financial institutions we believe to be of high credit quality 
to date we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
we grant credit under normal payment terms  generally without collateral  to our customers 
these customers primarily consist of telephone companies  cable television multiple system operators and electric and gas utilities 
with respect to a portion of the services provided to these customers  we have certain statutory lien rights which may  in certain circumstances  enhance our collection efforts 
adverse changes in overall business and economic factors may impact our customers and increase potential credit risks 
these risks may be heightened as a result of economic uncertainty and market volatility 
in the past  some of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties and likewise  some may experience financial difficulties in the future 
these difficulties expose us to increased risks related to the collectability of amounts due for services performed 
we believe that none of our significant customers were experiencing financial difficulties that would materially impact the collectability of our trade accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings as of july  
table of contents legal proceedings in october  a former employee of utiliquest  llc utiliquest  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  commenced a lawsuit against utiliquest in the superior court of california the california superior court 
the lawsuit alleges that utiliquest violated the california labor code  the california business professions code and the labor code private attorneys general act of by failing to pay for all hours worked including overtime and failing to provide meal breaks and accurate wage statements

an initial case management conference took place in august it is too early to evaluate the likelihood of an outcome to this matter or estimate the amount or range of potential loss  if any 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against this lawsuit 
from time to time  we and our subsidiaries are parties to various other claims and legal proceedings 
it is the opinion of our management  based on information available at this time  that such other pending claims or proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
as part of our insurance program  we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages  and we have established reserves that we believe to be adequate based on current evaluations and our experience with these types of claims 
for these claims  the effect on our financial statements is generally limited to the amount needed to satisfy our insurance deductibles or retentions 
acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement or diversify our business 
we regularly review opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify  acquire  and successfully integrate companies 
on december   we acquired substantially all of the telecommunications infrastructure services subsidiaries the acquired subsidiaries of quanta services  inc for million in cash plus an adjustment of approximately million for working capital received in excess of a target amount and approximately million for other specified items 
the acquisition was funded through a combination of borrowings under a new million credit facility and cash on hand 
on december   our wholly owned subsidiary  dycom investments  inc  issued and additional million of senior subordinated notes due and used the net proceeds to repay approximately million of the credit facility borrowings 
we recognized approximately million of pre tax acquisition costs during fiscal related to the acquisition of the acquired subsidiaries  which are included within general and administrative expenses 
additionally  we incurred approximately million in pre tax integration costs during fiscal  which are also included within general and administrative expense 
the acquired subsidiaries provide specialty contracting services  including engineering  construction  maintenance and installation services to telecommunications providers  and other construction and maintenance services to electric and gas utilities and others 
principal business facilities are located in arizona  california  florida  georgia  minnesota  new york  pennsylvania  and washington 
on a combined basis  the businesses operate in states serving over individual customers 
we believe that the acquisition strengthens our customer base  geographic scope and technical services offerings 
in addition  it reinforces our rural engineering and construction capabilities  wireless construction resources  and broadband construction competencies 
we expect the acquisition to enhance the efficiency of the company operating scale 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired sage telecommunications corp of colorado  llc sage 
sage provides telecommunications construction and project management services primarily for cable operators in the western united states 
we recognized approximately million in pre tax acquisition costs related to sage 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we acquired certain assets of a tower construction and maintenance company 
the purchase prices of the businesses acquired have been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values on the respective dates of acquisition 
purchase price in excess of fair value of the separately identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed have been allocated to goodwill 
purchase price 
table of contents allocations are based on information regarding the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the dates of acquisition 
we determined the fair values used in the purchase price allocation for intangible assets based on historical data  estimated discounted future cash flows  contract backlog amounts  if applicable  and expected royalty rates for trademarks and trade names among other information 
for the acquired subsidiaries  the fair values used in the purchase price allocation for intangible assets were determined with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist 
the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires a number of judgments and is subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired subsidiaries was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal purchase price allocations of businesses acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal are preliminary and will be completed during fiscal when the valuations for intangible assets and other amounts are finalized 
additional information  which existed as of the date of acquisition but at that time was unknown  may become known to us during the remainder of the measurement period  a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date 
adjustments in the purchase price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill 
outlook the telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to advances in technology  increased competition as the telephone and cable companies have converged  growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services  and governmental broadband stimulus funding 
as a result of these factors  the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability 
telecommunications providers continue to outsource a significant portion of their engineering  construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment  provide flexibility in workforce sizing  expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to their business success 
these factors drive customer demand for the types of services we provide 
telecommunications network operators are increasingly relying on the deployment of fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers and businesses in order to respond to demands for capacity  reliability  and product bundles of voice  video  and high speed data services 
fiber deployments have enabled an increasing number of cable companies to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services 
these voice services require the installation of customer premise equipment and at times the upgrade of in home wiring 
additionally  fiber deployments are also facilitating the provisioning of video services by local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high speed data services 
several large telephone companies have pursued fiber to the premise and fiber to the node initiatives to compete actively with cable operators 
these long term initiatives and the possibility that other telephone companies may pursue similar strategies present opportunities for us 
significant demand for mobile broadband is driven by the proliferation of smart phones and other wireless data devices 
this demand and other advances in technology have created the need for wireless carriers to upgrade their networks 
wireless carriers are actively spending on their networks to respond to the explosion in wireless data traffic  upgrade network technologies to improve performance and efficiency and consolidate disparate technology platforms 
these customer initiatives present long term opportunities for us with the wireless service providers we serve 
further  the demand for mobile broadband has increased bandwidth requirements on the wired networks of our customers 
as the demand for mobile broadband grows  the amount of wireless traffic that must be backhauled over customers fiber networks increases and  as a result  carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites 
these trends are also increasing the demand for the types of services we provide 
cable companies are continuing to target the provision of data and voice services to residential customers and have expanded their service offerings to business customers 
often times these services are provided over fiber optic cables using metro ethernet technology 
the commercial geographies that cable companies are targeting for network deployments generally require incremental fiber optic cable deployment and  as a result  require the type of engineering and construction services that we provide 
additionally  we provide underground facility locating services to a variety of utility companies  including telecommunication providers 
underground facility locating is required prior to underground excavation and is impacted by overall economic activity 
underground excavation is required for the construction and maintenance of telephone  cable television  power  water  sewer  and gas utility networks  the construction and maintenance of roads and highways as well as the construction of new and existing commercial and residential projects 
as a result  the level of outsourcing of this requirement  along with the pace of overall economic activity influence the demand for underground facility locating services 

table of contents within the context of a slowly growing economy  we believe the latest trends and developments support our industry outlook 
we will continue to closely monitor the effects that changes in economic and market conditions may have on our customers and our business and we will continue to manage those areas of the business we can control 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings under the percentage of completion method of accounting  allowance for doubtful accounts  the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis  the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets  the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired  accrued insurance claims  income taxes  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense for performance based stock awards  and accruals for contingencies  including legal matters 
these estimates and assumptions require the use of judgment as to the likelihood of various future outcomes and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of these policies affect our reported and expected financial results and are discussed below 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies herein 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also important to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k contain additional information related to our accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies described herein  and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized as the services are performed 
the current asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the current liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
the cost estimation process is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals 
factors that we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in changes to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable balances each period 
this analysis considers the aging of account balances  historical bad debt experience  changes in customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  customer payment activity and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimate made by management may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
we recognize an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that a receivable is not collectible and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations 
we believe that none of our significant customers were experiencing financial difficulties that would materially impact our trade accounts receivable or allowance for doubtful accounts as of july  goodwill and intangible assets 
as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
as of july   we 
table of contents had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
the increase in goodwill and intangible assets is a result of our fiscal acquisitions 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
we account for goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standard codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic 
our reporting units goodwill and other related indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed annually as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in accordance with asc topic in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value 
in addition  they are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value 
during fiscal  the company adopted accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu 
asu permits entities testing for goodwill impairment to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in asc topic if we determine the fair value of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests  an impairment loss is recognized 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred 
in accordance with asc topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability is determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
should an asset not be recoverable  an impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of an asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is incurred 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred 
we use judgment in assessing if goodwill and intangible assets are impaired 
estimates of fair value are based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows taking into consideration historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions  as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
to measure fair value  we employ a combination of present value techniques which reflect market factors 
changes in our judgments and projections could result in significantly different estimates of fair value potentially resulting in additional impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business  the high level of competition existing within our industry  the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers  and the level of overall economic activity 
during times of slowing economic conditions  our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects 
individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole 
as a result  demand for the services of one or more of our reporting units could decline resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 
we performed our annual impairment assessment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each of fiscal  and and concluded that no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible asset was indicated at any reporting unit in each of fiscal  and during fiscal  we performed qualitative assessments on reporting units that comprise less than of our consolidated goodwill balance 
the qualitative assessments indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value exceeded carrying value for those reporting units 
for the remaining reporting units we performed the first step of the quantitative analysis described in asc topic the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value estimates of our reporting units were a a discount rate based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units  b terminal value based on terminal growth rates  and c seven expected years of cash flow before the terminal value for each annual test 
the table below outlines the key assumptions in each of our fiscal  and annual quantitative impairment analyses terminal growth rate range discount rate 
table of contents the discount rate reflects risks inherent within each reporting unit operating individually  which is greater than the risks inherent in the company as a whole 
the decreases in discount rates in both fiscal and fiscal are a result of reduced risk relative to industry conditions and a lower interest rate environment at the time of the analysis 
we believe the assumptions used in the impairment analysis each year are reflective of the risks inherent in the business models of our reporting units and within our industry 
for the businesses acquired in fiscal  there were no significant changes in forecast assumptions between the initial valuation date and the annual impairment analysis 
as a result  the estimated fair values determined during the fiscal annual impairment analysis approximated the reporting units carrying values 
excluding these businesses  if the discount rate applied in the fiscal impairment analysis had been basis points higher than estimated for each reporting unit and all other assumptions were held constant  the conclusion would remain unchanged and there would be no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible asset 
our utiliquest reporting unit  having a goodwill balance of approximately million and an indefinite lived trade name of million  has been at lower operating levels as compared to historical levels 
the fair value of the utiliquest reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by approximately 
the utiliquest reporting unit provides services to a broad range of customers including utilities and telecommunication providers 
these services are required prior to underground excavation and are influenced by overall economic activity  including construction activity 
the goodwill balance of this reporting unit may have an increased likelihood of impairment if a downturn in customer demand were to occur  or if the reporting unit were not able to execute against customer opportunities  and the long term outlook for their cash flows were adversely impacted 
furthermore  changes in the long term outlook may result in changes to other valuation assumptions 
as of july   we believe the goodwill is recoverable for all of the reporting units  however  there can be no assurances that the goodwill will not be impaired in future periods 
current operating results  including any losses  are evaluated by us in the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the estimates and assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties 
changes in judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in impairments of goodwill or intangible assets at additional reporting units 
additionally  adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units 
certain of our reporting units also have other intangible assets including customer relationships  trade names  and non compete intangibles 
as of july   we believe that the carrying amounts of these intangible assets are recoverable 
however  if adverse events were to occur or circumstances were to change indicating that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable  the assets would be reviewed for impairment and the assets could be impaired 
business combinations 
we account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting 
the purchase price of each acquired business is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective fair values on the date of acquisition 
any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the separately identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill 
the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires a number of judgments and is subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of assets and liabilities becomes available

asc topic  income taxes asc topic prescribes a two step process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
the first step evaluates an income tax position in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step measures the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for those income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
asc topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  recognition and classification of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under asc topic  companies may recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefit if the tax position is effectively as opposed to ultimately settled through examination  negotiation or litigation 
stock based compensation 
our stock based award programs are intended to attract  retain and reward talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests

in addition  awards are outstanding under other plans under which no further awards will be granted 
our policy is to issue new shares to satisfy equity awards under the plans 
the plans provide for the grants of a number of types of stock based awards  including stock options  restricted shares  performance shares  restricted share units  performance share units performance rsus  and stock appreciation rights 
the total number of shares available for grant under the plans as of july  was  compensation expense for stock based awards is based on the fair value at the measurement date and is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on certain assumptions including expected volatility based on the historical price of our stock over the expected life of the option  the risk free rate of return based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option  the expected life based on the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding using historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination  and dividend yield based on our history and expectation of dividend payments 
stock options generally vest ratably over a four year period and are exercisable over a period of up to ten years 
the fair value of time based restricted share units rsus and performance rsus is estimated on the date of grant and is generally equal to the closing stock price on that date 
rsus vest ratably over a period of four years and are settled in one share of our common stock on the vesting date 
performance rsus vest over a three year period from the date of grant if certain performance goals are achieved 
the performance targets are based on our fiscal year operating earnings adjusted for certain amounts as a percentage of contract revenues and our fiscal year operating cash flow level 
for the fiscal performance period  the performance targets exclude amounts attributable to significant businesses acquired in fiscal  including acquisition  financing  and other related costs of the businesses acquired 
additionally  the awards include three year performance goals having similar measures as the fiscal year targets which  if met  result in supplemental shares awarded 
for performance rsus  we evaluate compensation expense quarterly and recognize expense for performance based awards if we determine it is probable that the performance criteria for the awards will be met 
the total amount of stock based compensation expense ultimately recognized is based on the number of awards that actually vest and fluctuates as a result of performance criteria for performance based awards  as well as the vesting period of all stock based awards

table of contents representative of future stock based compensation expense 
in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation  compensation costs for performance based awards are recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance goal will be satisfied 
we use our best judgment to determine probability of achieving the performance goals at each reporting period and recognize compensation costs based on the estimate of the shares that are expected to vest 
contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
asc topic  contingencies asc topic requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued  we evaluate  among other factors  the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
if only a range of probable loss can be determined  we accrue for our best estimate within the range for the contingency 
in those cases where none of the estimates within the range is better than another  we accrue for the amount representing the low end of the range in accordance with asc topic as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending contingencies and litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
additionally  if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in a charge to earnings when determined

purchase and other contractual obligations in the above table primarily represents obligations under agreements to purchase undelivered vehicles and equipment 
we have excluded contractual obligations under the multiemployer defined pension plans that cover certain of our employees as these obligations are determined based on our future union employee payrolls  which cannot be reliably determined as of july  during fiscal   and  our contributions to the multiemployer defined pension plan totaled approximately million  million  and million  respectively 

table of contents our consolidated balance sheet as of july  includes a long term liability of approximately million for accrued insurance claims 
this liability has been excluded from the above table as the timing of any cash payments is uncertain 
see note  accrued insurance claims  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our accrued insurance claims liability 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions at july  and july  was million and million  respectively  and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
this amount has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions with the relevant tax authorities 
off balance sheet arrangements 
performance bonds and guarantees we have obligations under performance and other surety contract bonds related to certain of our customer contracts 
performance bonds generally provide a customer with the right to obtain payment and or performance from the issuer of the bond if we fail to perform our contractual obligations 
as of july   we had million of outstanding performance and other surety contract bonds 
the estimated cost to complete projects secured by our outstanding performance and other surety contract bonds was approximately million as of july  no events have occurred in which the customers have exercised their rights under the bonds 
additionally  we have periodically guaranteed certain obligations of our subsidiaries  including obligations in connection with obtaining state contractor licenses and leasing real property and equipment 
letters of credit we have standby letters of credit issued under our credit agreement as part of our insurance program 
these letters of credit collateralize our obligations to our insurance carriers in connection with the settlement of potential claims 
as of july  and july  we had million and million  respectively  outstanding standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement 
sufficiency of capital resources 
we believe that our capital resources  including existing cash balances and amounts available under our credit agreement  are sufficient to meet our financial obligations 
these obligations include interest payments required on our senior subordinated notes and outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement  working capital requirements  and the normal replacement of equipment at our current level of operations for at least the next twelve months 
our future operating results and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including our success in bidding on future contracts and our ability to manage costs effectively 
to the extent we seek to grow by acquisitions that involve consideration other than our stock  or to the extent we buy back our common stock  repay revolving borrowings or repurchase or call our senior subordinated notes  our capital requirements may increase 
changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy could adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets  in which case we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the credit agreement to provide short term funding 
management continually monitors the financial markets and assesses general economic conditions for any impact on our financial position 
if changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy adversely impact our ability to access capital markets  we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the existing committed credit facility to provide short term funding 
we believe that our cash investment policies are conservative and we expect that the current volatility in the capital markets will not have a material impact on our cash investments 
backlog 
our backlog totaled billion and billion at july  and july   respectively 
we expect to complete of the july  backlog during the next twelve months 
the increase in backlog is due in part to the incremental backlog resulting from businesses acquired in fiscal our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other contracts 
many of our contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and  more generally  our experience in procurements of this type 
revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of project accelerations  cancellations or delays due to various factors  including but not limited to commercial issues and adverse weather 
these factors can also cause revenue amounts to be realized in periods and at levels different than originally projected 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract 
our estimates of a customer requirements during a particular future period may prove to be inaccurate 

table of contents backlog is considered a non gaap financial measure as defined by sec regulation g  however  it is a common measurement used in our industry 
our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by others 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our revenues exhibit seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors 
consequently  our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters 
also  a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter  which decreases the number of available workdays 
additionally  our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period 
as a result  we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal year 
in addition  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenues and net income as a result of other factors  including the timing and volume of customers construction and maintenance projects  including possible delays as a result of material procurement  seasonal budgetary spending patterns of customers and the timing of their budget approvals  the commencement or termination of master service agreements and other long term agreements with customers  costs incurred to support growth internally or through acquisitions  fluctuations in results of operations caused by acquisitions  fluctuations in the employer portion of payroll taxes as a result of reaching the limitation on payroll withholdings obligations  changes in mix of customers  contracts  and business activities  fluctuations in insurance expense due to changes in claims experience and actuarial assumptions  fluctuations in stock based compensation expense as a result of performance criteria in performance based share awards  as well as the timing and vesting period of all stock based awards  fluctuations in incentive pay as a result of operating results  fluctuations in interest expense due to levels of debt and related borrowing costs  fluctuations in other income as a result of the timing and levels of capital assets sold during the period  and fluctuations in income tax expense due to levels of taxable earnings  the impact of non deductible items and tax credits  and the impact of disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock option expenses 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates on our cash and equivalents and our debt obligations 
we monitor the effects of market changes on interest rates and manage interest rate risks by investing in short term cash equivalents with market rates of interest and by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase to annual earnings of approximately million if our cash and equivalents held as of july  were to be fully invested in interest bearing financial instruments 
our revolving credit facility permits borrowings at a variable rate of interest 
on july   we had variable rate debt outstanding under the credit agreement of million of revolver borrowings and a million term loan 
interest related to the borrowings fluctuates based on libor or the base rate of the bank administrative agent of the credit agreement 
at the current level of borrowings  for every basis point change in the interest rate  interest expense associated with such borrowings would correspondingly increase or decrease by approximately million annually 
additionally  outstanding long term debt on july  included million of principal amount of the notes  which bear a fixed rate of interest of 
due to the fixed rate of interest on the notes  changes in interest rates would not have an impact on the related interest expense 
the fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately million on july   based on quoted market prices  as compared to million carrying value including debt premium of million 
there exists market risk sensitivity on the fair value of the fixed rate notes with respect to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the market interest rates in effect would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the notes of approximately million  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
we also have market risk for foreign currency exchange rates related to our operations in canada 
as of july   the market risk for foreign currency exchange rates was not significant as our operations in canada have not been material
