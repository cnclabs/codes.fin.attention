asbestos claims and litigation the company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders 
the company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from the company policyholders which includes others seeking coverage under a policy 
factors underlying these claim filings include intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the continued focus by plaintiffs on previously peripheral defendants 
the focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years 
in addition to contributing to the overall number of claims  bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility of asbestos related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers  including the company 
the bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but that remain in the tort system 
currently  in many jurisdictions  those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts  while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket 
this trend of prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries  along with the focus on previously peripheral defendants  contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payments experienced by the company 
the company asbestos related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders  whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers 
the company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders  some of whom have filed for bankruptcy  who in some instances have asserted that all or a portion of their asbestos related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage 
in these instances  policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the policy 
it is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues 
to the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder favor and other company defenses are not successful  the company coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per occurrence limits and the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders 
accordingly  although the company has seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits  it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims 

table of contents many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements 
because many policyholders make exaggerated demands  it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations 
settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated 
there also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed settlement  which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the company 
as in the past  the company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities 
in addition to claims against policyholders  proceedings have been launched directly against insurers  including the company  by individuals challenging insurers conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos related bodily injuries 
it is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers  including the company  could be made in the future 
it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings  including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability 
the company believes it has meritorious defenses to these claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions 
travelers property casualty corp 
tpc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  had entered into settlement agreements which are subject to a number of contingencies  in connection with a number of these direct action claims direct action settlements 
for a full discussion of these settlement agreements  see the asbestos direct action litigation section of note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues  the company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually 
among the factors which the company may consider in the course of this review are available insurance coverage  including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder  limits and deductibles  an analysis of the policyholder potential liability  the jurisdictions involved  past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims  past settlement values of similar claims  allocated claim adjustment expense  potential role of other insurance  the role  if any  of non asbestos claims or potential non asbestos claims in any resolution process  and applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any  including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage  if any  for that claim 
in the third quarter of  the company completed its annual in depth asbestos claim review 
as in prior years  the annual claim review considered active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and non product liability 
the company noted the following trends continued high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious asbestos related illness  while overall payment patterns have been generally stable  there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to the continued high level of litigation activity  continued moderate level of asbestos related bankruptcy activity  and the absence of new theories of liability or new classes of defendants 
while the company believes that over the past several years there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the company overall asbestos exposure  there nonetheless remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure from asbestos claims 
during  total gross and net asbestos related payments decreased when compared with  primarily resulting from a decline in both gross and net payments to policyholders with whom the company has entered into settlement agreements 
the home office and field office categories  which 
table of contents account for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos related claims  experienced a modest reduction in gross asbestos related payments during when compared with  while net asbestos payments were flat 
payments on behalf of policyholders in these categories continue to be influenced by the high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos related injury continue to target previously peripheral defendants 
the number of policyholders tendering asbestos claims for the first time in and the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims both increased slightly when compared with the company quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category  as well as recent settlements  policyholder bankruptcies  judicial rulings and legislative actions 
the company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the home office  field office and assumed reinsurance and other categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries 
in addition  the company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience  year by year  to assess any emerging trends  fluctuations  or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity 
conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves nor have the company evaluations resulted in any way of determining a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment 
the completion of these reviews and analyses in  and resulted in million  million and million increases  respectively  in the company net asbestos reserves in each period 
in each year  the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the company estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of policyholders in the home office category and by higher projected payments on assumed reinsurance accounts 
the increase in the estimate of projected settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends that continue to be moderately higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment discussed above 
the increase in also reflected increases in costs of litigating asbestos related coverage matters and was partially offset by a million benefit from the reduction in the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance resulting from a favorable ruling related to a reinsurance dispute 
notwithstanding these trends  the company overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods  and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims 
net asbestos losses paid in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
approximately  and of total net paid losses in  and  respectively  related to policyholders with whom the company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the company liability 
the company categorizes its asbestos reserves as follows number of policyholders total net paid net asbestos reserves at and for the year ended december  in millions policyholders with settlement agreements home office and field office assumed reinsurance and other total the policyholders with settlement agreements category includes structured settlements  coverage in place arrangements and  with respect to tpc  wellington accounts 
reserves are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement 
structured settlements are arrangements under which policyholders and or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at scheduled times 
coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided 
payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are 
table of contents only made when valid claims are presented 
wellington accounts refer to the defendants that are parties to a agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims 
many of the aspects of the wellington agreement are similar to those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed 
the home office and field office category relates to all other policyholders and also includes unallocated ibnr reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos related coverage litigation 
policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based upon  among other factors a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold currently  perceived level of exposure  number of reported claims  products completed operations and potential non product exposures  size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder 
in addition to ibnr amounts contained in the reserves for home office and field office policyholders and the costs of litigating asbestos coverage matters  the company has established a reserve for further adverse development related to existing policyholders  new claims from policyholders reporting claims for the first time and policyholders for which there is  or may be  litigation and direct actions against the company 
during  million of reserves included in policyholders with settlement agreements were reclassified to the unallocated ibnr component in the home office and field office category as a result of the us district court ruling on march  that the conditions of the direct action settlements had not been satisfied 
for a full discussion of these settlement agreements see the asbestos direct action litigation section of note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the assumed reinsurance and other category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage  including various pool participations 
on january   the company and ppg industries  inc ppg  along with approximately other insurers of ppg  agreed in principle to an agreement to settle asbestos related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to ppg 
the tentative settlement agreement has been incorporated into the modified third amended plan of reorganization amended plan proposed as part of the pittsburgh corning corp 
pcc  which is owned by ppg bankruptcy proceeding 
pursuant to the proposed amended plan  which was filed on january   pcc  along with enumerated other companies including ppg as well as the company as a participating insurer  are to receive protections afforded by section g of the bankruptcy code from certain asbestos related bodily injury claims 
under the agreement in principle  the company has the option to make a series of payments over the next years totaling approximately million to the trust to be created under the amended plan  or it may elect to make a one time discounted payment  which  as of march   would total approximately million approximately million after reinsurance 
the agreement in principle with ppg is subject to numerous contingencies  including final court approval of the amended plan  and the company has no obligation to make the settlement payment until all contingencies are satisfied 
the company obligations under this agreement in principle are included in the home office and field office category in the preceding table

environmental claims and litigation the company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged disposition of toxic substances 
mostly  these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation 
for instance  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  enacted in and later modified  enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances 
this federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action 
liability under cercla may be joint and several with other responsible parties 
the company has been  and continues to be  involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims 
the company believes that some court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders 
these decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the company prior to the mid s 
these decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
environmental claims when submitted rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the policyholder  and the company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount 
the resolution of environmental exposures by the company generally occurs through settlements with policyholders as opposed to claimants 
generally  the company strives to extinguish any obligations it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past  present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder 
this form of settlement is commonly referred to as a buy back of policies for future environmental liability 
in addition  many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation which the 
table of contents company may have for other claims  including but not limited to asbestos and other cumulative injury claims 
the company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims 
where appropriate  these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the company 
the company general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the company potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related costs 
in establishing environmental reserves  the company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution  if any 
in the course of this analysis  the company generally considers the probable liability  available coverage  relevant judicial interpretations and historical value of similar exposures 
in addition  the company considers the many variables presented  such as the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site  the number of sites  the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site  the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site  the nature of government enforcement activities at each site  the ownership and general use of each site  the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the company and the policyholder  including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the company has issued to the policyholder  the involvement of other insurers  the potential for other available coverage  including the number of years of coverage  the role  if any  of non environmental claims or potential non environmental claims in any resolution process  and the applicable law in each jurisdiction 
the evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed 
conventional actuarial techniques are not used to estimate these reserves 
in its review of environmental reserves  the company considers past settlement payments  changing judicial and legislative trends  its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental coverage matters  the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean up actions for both on and off site waste disposal activities  the potential for adverse development  the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations  and the potential higher costs for new settlements 
the duration of the company investigation and review of these claims and the extent of time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate  if any  of the value of the claim to the company vary significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information  the pace of underlying litigation or claim processes  the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the company and the willingness of the policyholder and the company to negotiate  if appropriate  a resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims 
because these factors vary from claim to claim and policyholder by policyholder  the company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration of an environmental claim 
however  based upon the company experience in resolving these claims  the duration may vary from months to several years 
the company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time  frequently under policies issued prior to the mid s 
these policyholders continue to present smaller exposures  have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants 
further  in many instances  clean up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk based site analyses and more efficient clean up technologies 
overall net environmental claim payments in were essentially unchanged from over the past several years  the company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters 
the degree to which those favorable trends have continued  however  has been less than anticipated 
as a result  in and  the company increased its net environmental reserves by million and million  respectively 
in  the company increased its net environmental reserves by million due to a modest upward development in the expected defense and settlement costs for certain of its pending policyholders 

table of contents net environmental losses paid in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
at december   approximately of the net environmental reserve approximately million was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims  incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage litigation disputes relating to these claims 
the bulk reserve the company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in process environmental claims and the company experience in resolving those claims 
the balance  approximately of the net environmental reserve approximately million  consists of case reserves 
the following table displays activity for environmental losses and loss expenses and reserves at and for the year ended december  in millions beginning reserves gross ceded net incurred losses and loss expenses gross ceded net losses paid gross ceded net ending reserves gross ceded net uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves as a result of the processes and procedures discussed above  management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims at december  are appropriately established based upon known facts  current law and management judgment 
however  the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue  and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation 
as a result  these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop 
the continuing uncertainties include  without limitation  the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation  any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants  a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve  and or the number of  asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated  the role of any umbrella or excess policies the company has issued  the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the company previous assessment of these claims  the number and outcome of direct actions against the company  future developments pertaining to the company ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders  whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers 
in addition  uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants 
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal  regulatory 
table of contents and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims 
this environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations  including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims 
it is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or  failing settlement  until the dispute is adjudicated 
this is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective 
as part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves  the company continues to study the implications of these and other developments 
also see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
because of the uncertainties set forth above  additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the company current reserves 
in addition  the company estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change 
these additional liabilities or increases in estimates  or a range of either  cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the company operating results in future periods

mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and pass through securities the company fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  and included billion and billion  respectively  of residential mortgage backed securities including pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations cmo  all of which are subject to prepayment risk either shortening or lengthening of duration 
while prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled  particularly when interest rates move dramatically  the company investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected 
table of contents interest rate ranges 
included in the totals at december  and were billion and billion  respectively  of gnma  fnma and fhlmc excluding fha project loans guaranteed residential mortgage backed pass through securities classified as available for sale 
also included in those totals were residential cmos classified as available for sale with a fair value of billion and billion  at december  and  respectively 
approximately and of the company cmo holdings at december  and  respectively  were guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by gnma  fnma or fhlmc 
the average credit rating of the million and billion of non guaranteed cmo holdings at december  and  respectively  was b and ba  respectively 
the average credit rating of all of the above securities was a and aa at december  and  respectively 
the company makes investments in residential cmos that are either guaranteed by gnma  fnma or fhlmc  or if not guaranteed  are senior or super senior positions within their respective securitizations 
both guaranteed and non guaranteed residential cmos allocate the distribution of payments from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders 
in addition  non guaranteed residential cmos provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of bondholders 
senior and super senior cmos are protected  to varying degrees  from credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders 
the company investment strategy is to purchase cmo tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable return given the company assessment of associated risks 
the company does not purchase residual interests in cmos 
alternative documentation mortgages and sub prime mortgages at december  and  the mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and pass through securities and asset backed and other categories in the foregoing table included collateralized mortgage obligations backed by alternative documentation mortgages and asset backed securities collateralized by sub prime mortgages with a collective fair value of million and million  respectively comprising less than of the company total fixed maturity investments at both dates 
the continued disruption in secondary investment markets provided the company with the opportunity to selectively acquire additional mortgage backed securities at discounted prices in recent years 
the company purchased million and million of such securities in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company defines sub prime mortgage backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the following characteristics low fico scores  above prime interest rates  high loan to value ratios or high debt to income ratios 
alternative documentation securitizations are those in which the underlying loans primarily meet the government sponsored entities requirements for credit score but do not meet the government sponsored entities guidelines for documentation  property type  debt and loan to value ratios 
the average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the company was ba and baa at december  and  respectively 
commercial mortgage backed securities and project loans at december  and  the company held commercial mortgage backed securities including fha project loans of million and million  respectively 
the company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations  financial position or liquidity  due to the portfolio relatively small size and the underlying credit strength of these securities

catastrophe modeling the company uses various analyses and methods  including proprietary and third party computer modeling processes  to analyze catastrophic events and the risks associated with them 
the company uses these analyses and methods to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events 
there are no industry standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure 
accordingly  catastrophe estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable 
the company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third party models and  when necessary  calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling processes 
the company considers historical loss experience  recent events  underwriting practices  market share 
table of contents analyses and various other factors to account for non modeled losses to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk 
these proprietary models are continually updated as new information emerges 
the tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses from a single event occurring in a one year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts expressed in dollars and as a percentage of the company common equity  based on the current version of the proprietary and third party computer models utilized by the company at december  for example  on the basis described below the tables  the company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the company loss from a single us hurricane in a one year timeframe would equal or exceed billion  or of the company common equity at december  dollars in billions likelihood of exceedance single us hurricane single us and canadian earthquake in in in in  percentage of common equity likelihood of exceedance single us hurricane single us and canadian earthquake in in in in  an event that has  for example  a likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a in year event 
as noted above  however  the probabilities in the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one year timeframe  not over a multi year timeframe 
also  because the probabilities relate to a single event  the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period  and  therefore  the amounts do not address potential aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one year timeframe 
the percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing a indicated loss amounts in dollars by b total common equity excluding net unrealized investment gains and losses  net of taxes 
net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends 
accordingly  the company management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the company financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions 
the threshold loss amounts in the tables above  which are based on the company in force portfolio at december  and catastrophic reinsurance program at january   are net of reinsurance  after tax and exclude most loss adjustment expenses  which historically have been less than of loss estimates 
the amounts for hurricanes reflect us exposures and include property exposures  property residual market exposures and an adjustment for certain non property exposures 
the hurricane loss amounts are based on the company catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge 
the amounts for earthquakes reflect us 
table of contents and canadian exposures and include property exposures and workers compensation exposures 
the company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts 
catastrophe modeling relies upon inputs based on experience  science  engineering and history 
these inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may result in volatility in the modeled output 
catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable 
catastrophe modeling assumptions include  among others  the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event  which may prove to be materially incorrect 
consequently  catastrophe modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty 
in the tables above  the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of exceedance decreases 
in other words  in the case of a relatively more remote event eg  in  the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable 
actual losses from an event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount 
in addition  more than one such event could occur in any period 
moreover  the company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes  and it is exposed to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes  such as tornadoes and other windstorms  hail  wildfires  severe winter weather  floods  volcanic eruptions  tsunamis and acts of terrorism 
for more information about the company exposure to catastrophe losses  see item a risk factors catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  our financial position and or liquidity  and could adversely impact our ratings  our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance and item a risk factors we may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results 
changing climate conditions severe weather events over the last several years have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created uncertainty regarding insurers exposures to financial loss as a result of catastrophes and other weather related events 
some scientists believe that  in recent years  changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability  frequency and severity of natural disasters 
for example  in recent years hurricane activity has impacted areas further inland than previously experienced  thus expanding the company potential for losses from hurricanes 
additionally  both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms in the united states have been greater in recent years 
further  any reduction in arctic sea ice may contribute to rising sea levels that could impact flooding in coastal areas 
accordingly  if climate conditions are changing  the company may be subject to increased losses from catastrophes and other weather related events 
additionally  the company catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased unpredictability  frequency and severity of severe weather events 
the company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under risk factors in item a of this report and under outlook herein 
for example  among other things increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by the company 
see risk factors catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  our financial position and or liquidity  and could adversely impact our ratings  our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance and outlook underwriting gain loss 

table of contents changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the company invests 
for example  water supply adequacy could impact the creditworthiness of bond issuers in the southwestern united states  and more frequent and or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers in the southeastern united states  among other areas 
see risk factors our investment portfolio may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses 
increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the company and its customers 
for example  state insurance regulation could impact the company ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses 
if the company is unable to implement risk based pricing  modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events should those increased losses occur  its business may be adversely affected 
see risk factors catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  our financial position and or liquidity  and could adversely impact our ratings  our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance 
the full range of potential liability exposures related to climate change continues to evolve 
through the company emerging issues committee and its committee on climate  energy and the environment  the company works with its business units and corporate groups  as appropriate  to identify and try to assess climate change related liability issues  which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate 
see risk factors the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
climate change regulation also could increase the company customers costs of doing business 
for example  insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may  over time  increase loss exposures 
also  increased regulation may result in reduced economic activity  which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses 
the company regularly reviews emerging issues  such as changing climate conditions  to consider potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling  as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies  coverage modifications or new products 
reinsurance recoverables ceded reinsurance involves credit risk  except with regard to mandatory pools for which liability is mostly joint and several  and is generally subject to aggregate loss limits 
although the reinsurer is liable to the company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded  the company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured 
reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts 
the company monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements periodically 
reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition  business practices and the price of their product offerings 
after reinsurance is purchased  the company has limited ability to manage the credit risk to a reinsurer 
in addition  in a number of jurisdictions  particularly the european union and the united kingdom  a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer  which may be less creditworthy  without a counterparty consent  provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and or court authority 
the company holds collateral  including trust agreements  escrow funds and letters of credit  under certain reinsurance agreements 
the company has also entered into master security agreements with certain reinsurers 
these agreements define conditions that require the reinsurer to provide collateral 
the specific conditions and the amounts and form of collateral to be provided by these 
table of contents agreements vary based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the reinsurers legal structure and trading history with the company 
the following table summarizes the composition of the company reinsurance recoverables at december  in millions gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses allowance for uncollectible reinsurance net reinsurance recoverables mandatory pools and associations structured settlements total reinsurance recoverables the million decline in net reinsurance recoverables since december  primarily reflected the impact of cash collections  including commutation agreements  and the impact of net favorable prior year reserve development

for a discussion of a pending reinsurance dispute pertaining to a portion of the company reinsurance recoverable from the munich re group in the foregoing table  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
also included in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements  which are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal physical injury claims  of which workers compensation claims comprise a significant portion 
in cases where the company did not receive a release from the claimant  the amount due from the life insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the company consolidated balance sheet as a liability and as a reinsurance recoverable  as the company retains the contingent liability to the claimant 
in the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments  the company would be required to make such payments if and to the extent the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations

a number of such companies have been subjected to downgrades and or negative outlook changes by various ratings agencies  including those with which the company conducts business 
the company considers these factors in assessing the adequacy of its allowance for uncollectible amounts 
outlook the following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the company results of operations and capital position 
premiums 
the company earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume 
net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies 
when business renews  the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease renewal premium change as a result of increases or decreases in rate and or insured exposures  which the company considers as a measure of units of exposure such as the number and value of vehicles or properties insured 
net written premiums from both renewal and new business  and therefore earned premiums  are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions  which  particularly in the case of the business insurance segment  affect audit premium adjustments  policy endorsements and mid term cancellations 
net written premiums are also impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs 
given the possibility that more active weather patterns such as the company experienced in a number of recent periods may continue  as well as the possibility that interest rates may remain low for some period of time  along with the current level of profitability in certain of its product lines  the company has undertaken efforts to improve its underwriting margins 
these efforts include seeking improved rates  as well as improved terms and conditions on many of its insurance products  and also include other initiatives  such as reducing operating expenses and acquisition costs 
these efforts may not be successful and or may result in lower retention and new business levels and therefore lower business volumes 
in particular  in the agency automobile line of business  the company has undertaken various actions to improve its underwriting margins  which have been negatively impacted by various factors 
if these actions are not effective  the company may need to explore other actions or initiatives to improve its competitive position and profitability in this line of business 
refer to part i item a risk factors the intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability in this report 
nonetheless  the company currently expects retention levels the amount of expiring premium that renews  before the impact of renewal premium changes will remain strong relative to historical experience 
the company also expects to continue to achieve price increases on renewal business during that generally exceed loss cost trends 
in the business insurance segment  the company expects that renewal premium changes during will be broadly consistent with the higher levels 
table of contents attained in the fourth quarter of and will be driven by both positive renewal rate changes and  subject to the economic uncertainties discussed below  growth in insured exposures 
in the financial  professional international insurance segment  the company expects that renewal premium changes will modestly improve during compared to the fourth quarter of with respect to construction surety  the company expects written premium volume to be broadly consistent with the levels attained in in the personal insurance segment  the company expects both agency automobile and agency homeowners and other renewal premium changes during will decline slightly as compared to the fourth quarter of  but are expected to remain positive and exceed underlying loss cost trends  assuming weather patterns consistent with the company expectations 
renewal premium changes for both agency automobile and agency homeowners and other in are expected to be driven by both positive renewal rate changes based on the company actions to file for rate increases and  subject to the economic uncertainties discussed below  growth in insured exposures 
the need for state regulatory approval for changes to personal property and casualty insurance prices  as well as competitive market conditions  may impact the timing and extent of renewal premium changes 
the pricing environment for new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal rate changes  given the volume of new business relative to renewal business 
property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during for new business  not only in business insurance and financial  professional international insurance  but especially in personal insurance  where price comparison technology used by agents and brokers  sometimes referred to as comparative raters  has facilitated the process of generating multiple quotes  and thereby increasing price comparison on new business and  increasingly  on renewal business 
in addition  the company launched a new distribution channel in that markets personal insurance products directly to consumers  which is expected to continue to generate modest growth in premium volume for personal insurance during current economic conditions have been somewhat volatile  and there is increased uncertainty as to whether the us or the global economy will grow modestly  remain stagnant or enter a recession 
economic growth experienced in and may or may not continue  or may continue at a slower rate for an extended period of time 
in addition  some economic conditions  such as the commercial and residential real estate environment and employment rates  may continue to be weak 
future actions or inactions of the united states government  including a failure to increase the government debt limit or a shutdown of the federal government  could increase the actual or perceived risk that the us may not ultimately pay its obligations when due and may disrupt financial markets 
further  general uncertainty regarding the us federal budget and taxes has added to the uncertainty regarding economic conditions generally 
if weak economic conditions persist or deteriorate  the resulting low levels of economic activity could impact exposure changes at renewal and the company ability to write business at acceptable rates 
additionally  low levels of economic activity could adversely impact audit premium adjustments  policy endorsements and mid term cancellations after policies are written 
all of the foregoing  in turn  could adversely impact net written premiums during  and  since earned premiums lag net written premiums  earned premiums could be adversely impacted following underwriting gain loss 
the company underwriting gain loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development  as well as underlying underwriting margins 
catastrophe and other weather related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period 
the company experienced significant catastrophe and other weather related losses in a number of recent periods which adversely impacted its results of operations 
the company results of operations 
table of contents would continue to be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and other weather related losses were to occur during for the last several years  the company results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development  although at lower levels in some recent years  driven by better than expected loss experience in all of the company segments 
the lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development in a number of recent periods may have been in part due to the company reserve estimation process incorporating those factors that led to the higher levels of net favorable prior year reserve development in previous years 
if that trend continues  the better than expected loss experience may continue at these recent lower levels  or even lower levels 
however  given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves  loss experience could develop such that the company recognizes higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development  no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development in future periods 
in addition  the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves  or other changes in current period circumstances  may result in the company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year 
in business insurance  the company expects that the anticipated impact of increases in renewal premium changes  partially offset by an expected modest increase in underlying losses  and assuming weather patterns consistent with the company expectations  will likely result in underlying underwriting margins during that are higher than in in financial  professional international insurance  the company expects that the anticipated impact of lower underlying losses due to recent underwriting actions in the segment and increases in renewal premium changes in bond financial products will likely result in underlying underwriting margins during that are modestly higher than in in personal insurance  the company anticipates underlying underwriting margins during that are broadly consistent with in agency automobile  the company anticipates an improvement in underlying underwriting margins during due to the anticipated impact of continued positive renewal premium changes  partially offset by loss cost trends 
in agency homeowners and other  the company anticipates a decline in underlying underwriting margins during  reflecting a return to non catastrophe weather related loss levels consistent with the company expectations 
also in personal insurance  the company direct to consumer initiative  as discussed above  while intended to enhance the company long term ability to compete successfully in a consumer driven marketplace  is expected to remain unprofitable for a number of years as this book of business grows and matures 
investment portfolio 
the company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration 
the average effective duration of fixed maturities and short term securities was excluding short term securities at december  in  subject to market conditions  the company plans to increase its short position in us treasury futures  which it uses to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio 
the company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix 
currently  the majority of the company investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high quality  liquid taxable us government  tax exempt us municipal and taxable corporate and us agency mortgage backed bonds 
the company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities  real estate  private equity limited partnerships  hedge funds  real estate partnerships  joint ventures  mortgage loans  venture capital through direct ownership and limited partnerships and trading securities 
these investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for higher degrees of risk  including less stable rates of return and less liquidity 
net investment income is a material contributor to the company results of operations 
interest rates remain at very low levels by historical standards 
based on the current interest rate environment  
table of contents the company estimates that the impact of lower reinvestment yields on the company fixed maturity portfolio could  in  result in approximately million of lower after tax net investment income from that portfolio on a quarterly basis as compared to the corresponding quarter of given recent general economic and investment market conditions  the company expects investment income from the non fixed maturity portfolio for to be lower than in if general economic conditions and or investment market conditions deteriorate in  the company could also experience a reduction in net investment income and or significant realized investment losses  including impairments

capital position 
the company believes it has a strong capital position and  as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value  expects to continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders 
in recent years  the company has returned capital to its shareholders  comprising dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases  in amounts that have exceeded its operating income 
the company now expects that  generally over time  the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed operating income 
in addition  actual amounts of common share repurchases will also depend on a variety of additional factors  including corporate and regulatory requirements  maintaining capital levels commensurate with the company existing ratings from independent rating agencies  share price  funding of the company qualified pension plan  strategic initiatives and other market conditions 
for information regarding the company common share repurchases in  see liquidity and capital resources in this report 
the company had a net after tax unrealized investment gain of billion in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at december  while the company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements  a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and  therefore  reduce shareholders equity  and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects 
many of the statements in this outlook section are forward looking statements  which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the company control 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of a company ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations and to satisfy general corporate purposes when needed 
the liquidity requirements of the company have been met primarily by funds generated from premiums  fees  income received on investments and investment maturities 
cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments  operating expenses  debt servicing  taxes  shareholder dividends and  in recent years  for common share repurchases 
the timing and amount of catastrophe claims are inherently unpredictable 
such claims increase liquidity requirements 
the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries may be affected by reinsurer solvency and 
table of contents reinsurance coverage disputes 
additionally  the variability of asbestos related claim payments  as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation  may also result in increased liquidity requirements 
it is the opinion of the company management that the company future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the above sources 
at december   total cash and short term invested assets aggregating billion and having a weighted average maturity of days were held in the united states by the holding company 
these assets are sufficient to meet the holding company current liquidity requirements and are in excess of the company minimum target level  comprising the company estimated annual pretax interest expense and common shareholder dividends  and currently totaling approximately billion 
these liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends  debt service and contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan from time to time 
the holding company is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs 
us income taxes have not been recognized on million of the company foreign operations undistributed earnings as of december   as such earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations 
furthermore  taxes paid to foreign governments on these earnings may be used as credits against the us tax on dividend distributions if such earnings were to be distributed to the holding company 
the amount of undistributed earnings from foreign operations and related taxes on those undistributed earnings were not material to the company financial position or liquidity at december  the company has a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which permits it to issue securities from time to time 
the company also has a billion line of credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in june this line of credit also supports the company million commercial paper program  of which million was outstanding at december  the company is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs 
the company currently utilizes uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of approximately million to provide much of the capital needed to support its obligations at lloyd 
if uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future  the company can collateralize these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at lloyd  which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
cash flows in primarily reflected a decrease in losses paid related to catastrophes  a lower level of paid losses related to asbestos claims and operations in runoff and a higher level of collected premiums  partially offset by an increase in paid losses related to non catastrophe ongoing business including the impact of increased loss costs 
cash flows in reflected an increase in losses paid related to catastrophes and ongoing business including the impact of increased loss costs  a higher level of contributions to the company qualified domestic pension plan and lower receipts related to net investment income as compared with these factors were partially offset by a higher level of collected premiums  a lower level of paid operating expenses and a lower level of paid losses related to asbestos claims and operations in runoff

jmalucelli is currently the market leader in surety in brazil based on market share 
the company investment was funded with cash provided internally from an operating subsidiary of the company 
the company investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations  accordingly  the portfolio is positioned to meet obligations to policyholders 
as such  the primary goals of the company asset liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows 
generally  the expected principal and interest payments produced by the company fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the company insurance reserves 
although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period  the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities  as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds  contributes to the company ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities

the company million  senior notes matured on june  and were paid from existing holding company liquidity 
on june   the company repaid the remaining million principal balance on its real estate non recourse debt 
on november   the company issued million aggregate principal amount senior notes that will mature on november   and million aggregate principal amount senior notes that will mature on november  the net proceeds of these issuances  after original issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses  were approximately million and million  respectively 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually in arrears on november and may of each year 
the senior notes are redeemable in whole at any time or in part from time to time  at the company option  at a redemption price equal to the greater of a of the principal amount of senior notes to be redeemed or b the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the senior notes to be redeemed exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the date of redemption on a semi annual basis assuming a day year consisting of twelve day months at the

prior to november  the company was subject to a replacement capital covenant that it had granted to the holders of its senior notes due june  the senior notes 
the replacement capital covenant restricted the company ability to repurchase its billion in outstanding fixed to floating rate junior subordinated debentures due march  the debentures 
in november  the company paid approximately million to holders of the senior notes to terminate the replacement capital covenant 
following the termination  the company purchased approximately million aggregate principal amount of the debentures 
a million pretax loss was recognized in related to these transactions 
on september   the company repaid the remaining million principal balance on its private placement senior notes 
on august   the company million  medium term notes matured and were fully paid 
on april   the company million  senior notes matured and were fully paid 
all of these debt payments were made from internally generated funds 
the amount of debt obligations  other than commercial paper  that becomes due in is million

the company may refinance maturing debt through funds generated internally or  depending on market conditions  through funds generated externally  including as a result of the issuance of debt or other securities 
dividends 
dividends paid to shareholders were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the company common stock will be at the discretion of the company board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including the company financial position  earnings  capital requirements of the company operating subsidiaries  legal requirements  regulatory constraints and other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
dividends will be paid by the company only if declared by its board of directors out of funds legally available  subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the company 
on january   the company announced that it declared a regular quarterly dividend of per share  payable march  to shareholders of record on march  share repurchases 
the company board of directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market  pursuant to pre set trading plans meeting the requirements of rule b under the securities exchange act of  in private transactions or otherwise 
the authorizations do not have a stated expiration date 
the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors  including the company financial position  earnings  share price  catastrophe losses  funding of the company qualified pension plan  capital requirements of the company operating subsidiaries  legal requirements  regulatory constraints  other investment opportunities including mergers and acquisitions  market conditions and other factors

conversion of preferred stock to common stock 
in may  the company board of directors authorized the redemption of the company preferred stock held by the travelers k savings plan the savings plan and gave notice of that redemption to the appropriate fiduciaries of the savings plan 
following a fiduciary review  the savings plan exercised its right to convert each preferred share into eight shares of the company common stock 
as a result  all preferred shares outstanding on june   shares were converted into a total of million shares of the company common stock 
capital resources capital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet its needs

the following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments to total capitalization presented in the foregoing table 
at december  dollars in millions total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments net unrealized gain on investments  net of taxes total capitalization debt to total capital ratio debt to total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments 
table of contents the debt to total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains on investments is calculated by dividing a debt by b total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments  net of taxes 
net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends 
accordingly  in the opinion of the company management  the debt to total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to understand the company financial leverage position 
the company debt to total capital ratio of at december  calculated on this basis was within the company target range of to 
line of credit agreement 
the company is party to a three year  billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires in june pursuant to the credit agreement covenants  the company must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth generally defined as shareholders equity plus certain trust preferred and mandatorily convertible securities  reduced for goodwill and other intangible assets of billion 
the company must also maintain a ratio of total debt to the sum of total debt plus consolidated net worth of not greater than to 
in addition  the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of default  including with respect to a change in control  which is defined to include the acquisition of or more of the company voting stock and certain changes in the composition of the company board of directors 
at december   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
generally  the cost of borrowing under this agreement will range from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points depending on the company credit ratings 
at december   that cost would have been libor plus basis points had there been any amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
this line of credit also supports the company commercial paper program 
shelf registration 
the company has filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement for the potential offering and sale of securities to replace the company previous registration statement that had expired in the normal course of business 
the company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering 
share repurchase authorization 
at december   the company had billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes  as of december   the company future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims and claim related payments 
the table excludes short term obligations and includes only liabilities at december  that are expected to be settled in cash 
the table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim related payments 
the amounts do not represent the exact liability  but instead represent estimates  generally utilizing actuarial projections techniques  at a given accounting date 
these estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on the company assessment of facts and circumstances then known  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims severity  frequency  legal theories of liability and other factors 
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  economic inflation or deflation  legal trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
additionally  there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer 
the future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount including severity considerations and timing 
amount and timing are frequently estimated separately 
an estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows 
table of contents related to claims and claim related payments is generally reliable only in the aggregate with some unavoidable estimation uncertainty 
the contractual obligations related to debt  operating leases  purchase obligations  long term unfunded investment commitments  estimated claims and claim related payments gross of the estimated reinsurance recoveries and liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits  at december  were as follows payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years debt senior notes junior subordinated debentures total debt principal interest total long term debt obligations operating leases purchase obligations information systems administration and maintenance commitments other purchase commitments total purchase obligations long term unfunded investment commitments estimated claims and claim related payments claims and claim adjustment expenses claims from large deductible policies loss based assessments reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits payout from ceded funds withheld total estimated claims and claim related payments liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits total the company million remaining aggregate principal amount of fixed to floating rate debentures bear interest at an annual rate of from the date of issuance to  but excluding  march  and at a rate of three month libor plus thereafter 
the table above includes interest payments through the scheduled maturity date of march  interest payments beginning march  through march  were calculated using the three month libor rate as of december  see note of notes to the company consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of outstanding indebtedness 
because the amounts reported in the foregoing table include principal and interest  the total long term debt obligations will not agree with the amounts reported in note represents agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business to lease office space  equipment and furniture

includes commitments to vendors entered into in the ordinary course of business for goods and services including property  plant and equipment  office supplies  archival services  etc 
represents estimated timing for fulfilling unfunded commitments for private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships 
the amounts in claims and claim adjustment expenses in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses  gross of reinsurance recoverables  excluding structured settlements expected to be paid by annuity companies 
the company has entered into reinsurance agreements to protect itself from potential losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept as described in note of notes to the company consolidated financial statements 
in order to qualify for reinsurance accounting  a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk  ie  the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk 
since the timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer  reinsurance recoverables are recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses relating to the underlying reinsured contracts 
the presence of any feature that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance see below 
the assumptions used in estimating the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities 
reinsurance agreements that do not transfer both amount and timing risk are accounted for as deposits and included in reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits in the table above 
the estimated future cash inflows from the company reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows in millions total less than year years years after years reinsurance recoverables the company manages its business and evaluates its liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expense on a net of reinsurance basis 
the estimated cash flows on a net of reinsurance basis are as follows in millions total less than year years years after years claims and claim adjustment expenses  net for business underwritten by non us operations  future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on december  the amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money 
accordingly  the amounts above will differ from the company balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted in the balance sheet 
see note of notes to the company consolidated financial statements 

table of contents workers compensation large deductible policies provide third party coverage in which the company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount 
claims from large deductible policies represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses below the deductible amount  net of the estimated recovery of the deductible 
the liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as contractholder payables and contractholder receivables  respectively 
most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder escrow which is periodically replenished by the policyholder 
the payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within claims and claim adjustment expenses in the above table 
because the timing of the collection of the deductible contractholder receivables occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant contractholder payables  these cash flows offset each other in the table 
the estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables for workers compensation policies is presented below in millions total less than year years years after years contractholder payables receivables the amounts in loss based assessments relate to estimated future payments of second injury fund assessments which would result from payment of current claim liabilities 
second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre existing condition 
for loss based assessments  the cost is shared by the insurance industry and self insureds  funded through assessments to insurance companies and self insureds based on losses 
amounts relating to second injury fund assessments are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the amounts in reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits represent estimated future nominal payments for reinsurance agreements that are accounted for as deposits 
amounts payable under deposit agreements are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the amounts reported in the table are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money 
accordingly  the amounts above will differ from the company balance sheet to the extent that deposit values in the balance sheet have been discounted using deposit accounting 
the amounts in payout from ceded funds withheld represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance arrangements whereby the company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held 
the company current liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are million 
offsetting these liabilities are deferred tax assets of million associated with the temporary differences that would exist if these positions become realized 
the above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of default by the company issuing the annuity 
the company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements 
in addition  the company is not currently subject to any minimum funding requirements for its qualified pension plan 
accordingly  future contributions are not included in the foregoing table 
dividend availability the company principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the state of connecticut 
the insurance holding company laws of connecticut applicable to the company subsidiaries requires notice to  and approval by  the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any 
table of contents dividend that  together with other distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of of the insurer capital and surplus as of the preceding december  or the insurer net income for the twelve month period ending the preceding december  in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation 
this declaration or payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus  as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
the insurance holding company laws of other states in which the company subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar  although in some instances somewhat more restrictive  limitations on the payment of dividends 
a maximum of billion is available by the end of for such dividends without prior approval of the connecticut insurance department 
the company may choose to accelerate the timing within and or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in  which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the connecticut insurance department 
the holding company is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs 
the undistributed earnings of the company foreign operations are not material and are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations 
the holding company received billion of dividends in  all of which was received from its us insurance subsidiaries 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the company sponsors a qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plan the qualified plan  which covers substantially all us domestic employees and provides benefits primarily under a cash balance formula 
in addition  the company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which covers certain highly compensated employees  pension plans for employees of its foreign subsidiaries  and a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees satisfying certain age and service requirements and for certain retirees 
the qualified plan is subject to regulations under the employee retirement income act of as amended erisa  which requires plans to meet minimum standards of funding and requires such plans to subscribe to plan termination insurance through the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc 
the company does not have a minimum funding requirement for the qualified plan for and does not anticipate having a minimum funding requirement in the company has significant discretion in making contributions above those necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirements 
the company made discretionary contributions to the qualified plan of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
in determining future contributions  the company will consider the performance of the plan investment portfolio  the effects of interest rates on the projected benefit obligation of the plan and the company other capital requirements 
the company has not determined whether or not additional discretionary funding will be made in the current year or beyond 
however  the company currently believes  subject to actual plan performance and funded status at the time  that it may make discretionary pension contributions of approximately million to million annually over the next few years 
the qualified plan assets are managed to maximize long term total return 
the company overall strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately to of investments for long term growth and to for near term benefit payments with a wide diversification of asset types  fund strategies and fund managers 
the current target allocations for plan assets are to equity securities and to fixed income securities  with the remainder allocated to short term securities 
for  the company plans to apply an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  the same rate as in the rates of return reflect the company current expectations of long term returns on the plan invested assets  taking into account the current low level of long term interest rates as well as the federal reserve commentary in january regarding its expectation to maintain interest rates at their current low levels until the national unemployment rate drops to 
the company expected long term rate of return on plan assets also contemplates a return to more normal levels of long term interest rates in the future

risk based capital the naic has risk based capital rbc requirements for property casualty companies to be used as minimum capital requirements by the naic and states to identify companies that merit further regulatory action 
the formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital above the rbc requirements 
therefore  it is inappropriate and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies 
at december   all of the company insurance subsidiaries had adjusted capital in excess of amounts requiring any company or regulatory action 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to the sale of business entities  certain investments  third party loans related to certain investments  certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications

critical accounting estimates the company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables  investment valuation and impairments  and goodwill and other intangible assets impairments 
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows at december  in millions case ibnr total case ibnr total general liability commercial property commercial multi peril commercial automobile workers compensation fidelity and surety personal automobile homeowners and personal other international and other property casualty accident and health claims and claim adjustment expense reserves the million decrease in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since december  primarily reflected the impact of net favorable prior year reserve development and payments related to significant catastrophe losses incurred in as well as operations in runoff 
table of contents including asbestos and environmental claims  partially offset by the increase in loss cost trends and catastrophe losses incurred in asbestos and environmental reserves are included in the general liability  commercial multi peril and international and other lines in the foregoing summary table 
asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately  see asbestos claims and litigation  environmental claims and litigation and uncertainty regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves 
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but instead represent management estimates  generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques  at a given accounting date 
these estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost upon final resolution in the future  based on the company assessment of facts and circumstances then known  review of historical settlement patterns  estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency  expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors 
in establishing gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves  the company also considers salvage and subrogation 
estimated recoveries from reinsurance are included in reinsurance recoverables as an asset on the company consolidated balance sheet 
the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the company 
the process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables 
these variables can be affected by both internal and external events  such as changes in claims handling procedures  changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process  economic inflation  legal trends and legislative changes  among others 
the impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate 
estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity  the volume of claims  the potential severity of individual claims  the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer 
informed judgment is applied throughout the process  including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses 
the company continually refines its estimates in a regular ongoing process as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled 
the company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established 
due to the inherent uncertainty underlying these estimates including  but not limited to  the future settlement environment  final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date 
therefore  actual paid losses  as claims are settled in the future  may be materially different than the amount currently recorded favorable or unfavorable 
because establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may change 
the company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed 
there are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes 
for example  the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes  tornadoes and other catastrophic events can be affected by the inability of the company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas  the complexity of factors contributing to the losses  the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves 
complex factors include  but are not limited to determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind  evaluating general liability 
table of contents and pollution exposures  estimating additional living expenses  estimating the impact of demand surge  infrastructure disruption  fraud  the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs  and reinsurance collectibility 
the timing of a catastrophe  such as at or near the end of a reporting period  can also affect the information available to the company in estimating reserves for that reporting period 
the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge 
a portion of the company gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves totaling billion at december  are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation 
while the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage  plaintiffs expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties  in the opinion of the company management  it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could be material to the company future operating results 
see the preceding discussion of asbestos claims and litigation and environmental claims and litigation 
general discussion the process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data 
data on individual reported claims  both current and historical  including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates  are grouped by common characteristics components and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line 
such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate 
the process of analyzing reserves for a component is undertaken on a regular basis  generally quarterly  in light of continually updated information 
multiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities 
each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages  with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time 
therefore  the actual choice of estimation method s can change with each evaluation 
the estimation method s chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated 
in most cases  multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated 
this will result in a range of reasonable estimates for any particular claim liability 
the company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves at the reporting segments are reasonable  given subsequent information 
reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews 
these reviews may substantiate the validity of management recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate 
the exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature  as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable 
as a result  the company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies 
in addition  potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process 
property casualty insurance policies are either written on a claims made or on an occurrence basis 
claims made policies generally cover  subject to requirements in individual policies  claims reported during the policy period 
policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured 
table of contents demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period  even if the insured reports the loss many years later 
most general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis 
these policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years following the policy issuance 
the occurrence form  which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures  is also used to provide coverage for construction general liability  including construction defect 
occurrence based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of various trends  including future inflation  judicial interpretations and societal litigation trends eg  size of jury awards and propensity of individuals to pursue litigation  among others 
a basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future  absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below 
to the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known  such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and  if available and when appropriate  external data 
such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated 
significant structural changes to the available data  product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process 
informed judgment is applied throughout the reserving process 
this includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses 
in addition to actuaries  experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers  as well as other company management 
therefore  management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves 
it is also likely that during periods of significant change  such as a merger  consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult 
the variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line  depending on the length of the claim tail  the reporting lag  the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line 
product lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail  based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims 
short tail claims are reported and settled quickly  resulting in less estimation variability 
the longer the time before final claim resolution  the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty 
a major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag 
the reporting lag  which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer  makes estimating ibnr inherently more uncertain 
in addition  the greater the reporting lag  the greater the proportion of ibnr to the total claim liability for the product line 
writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years worth of ibnr claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable  thereby increasing the risk associated with pricing and reserving such products 
the most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims 
for some lines  the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis 
these lines are generally referred to as being low frequency high severity  while lines without this large claim sensitivity are referred to as high frequency low severity 
estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large claims 
as a result  the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates 
in contrast  for high frequency low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the range of reasonable reserve estimates is narrower and more stable 

table of contents claim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate  the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process  and the ability to gain an understanding of the data 
product lines with greater claim complexity  such as for certain surety and construction exposures  have inherently greater estimation uncertainty 
actuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves 
the human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty 
different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty  based on their individual backgrounds  professional experiences and areas of focus 
hence  the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other 
lastly  significant structural changes to the available data  product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process 
events such as mergers increase the inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time  until stable trends re establish themselves within the new organization 
risk factors the major causes of material uncertainty risk factors generally will vary for each product line  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the product line 
in a few cases  such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method  but in most cases  they are implicit 
for example  a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year  but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  causing actual paid losses  as claims are settled in the future  to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently 
some risk factors will affect more than one product line 
examples include changes in claim department practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting  state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components 
the effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases 
for example  estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the risk associated with potential court rulings  but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors 
the evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts  sometimes in unanticipated ways 
for example  the timing of claims payments in one geographic region will be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region 
while some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction  others are more evolutionary 
evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values  with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately  in stepwise fashion 
the final impact is not known until all steps have occurred 
sudden changes generally cause a one time shift in claim liability estimates  although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact 
evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates  as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable 

table of contents actuarial methods for analyzing and estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves the principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the company actuaries to evaluate management existing estimates for prior accident periods are the paid development method  the case incurred development method  the bornhuetter ferguson bf method  and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method 
the bf method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods  with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible 
these are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods 
see glossary for an explanation of these methods 
while these are the principal methods utilized throughout the company  actuaries evaluating a particular component for a product line have available to them the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession 
the company actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates 
some components of product line reserves are susceptible to relatively infrequent large claims that can materially impact the total estimate for that component 
in such cases  the company actuarial analysis generally isolates and analyzes separately such large claims 
the reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the conventional methods described above 
the reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed utilizing various methods  such as estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods  adjusted for the current environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available 
utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims  combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim adjuster estimates 
this monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates 
utilizing historic longer term average ratios of large claims to small claims  and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims from conventional analysis 
ground up analysis of the underlying exposure typically used for asbestos and environmental 
the results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests  including paid to incurred loss ratios  implied incurred loss to earned premium ratios and non zero claim severity trends 
an actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss development to expected development embedded within management best estimate 
additional analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics  including the investigation of other actuarial methods 
the methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management existing estimate for prior accident periods 
for the initial estimate of the current accident year  the available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication 
hence  the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on a loss ratio projection method  which uses the earned premium for the current year multiplied by a projected loss ratio 
the projected loss ratio is determined through an analysis of prior periods experience  using loss trend  rate level differences  mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident years 
the exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component  based on the volume of business for that component and the reliability of an individual accident year estimate 
management estimates at least once per quarter  certain members of company management meet with the company actuaries to review the latest claims and claim adjustment expense reserve analyses 
based on these 
table of contents analyses  management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed 
in doing so  it must evaluate whether the new data provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability 
for example  as described above  payments may have decreased in one geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims 
the resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern represents a change in ultimate claim liability 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment 
it is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later 
the overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several months to perform 
this is because the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated  which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available 
it may also include interviews with experts involved with the underlying processes 
as a result  there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the company estimated claim liabilities 
the final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data  adjusted to reflect any new actionable information 
the audit committee of the board of directors is responsible for providing oversight of reserving propriety  and annually reviews the process by which the company establishes reserves 
discussion of product lines the following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line 
there are many additional risk factors that may impact ultimate claim costs 
each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves 
also  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves 
for example  in workers compensation  the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster  thereby lowering indemnity costs 
thus  in almost all cases  it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation 
in order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line  the historical changes in year end claims and claim adjustment expense reserves over a one year period are provided for the us product lines 
this information is provided for both the company and the industry for the nine most recent years  and is based on the most recent publicly available data for the reported line s that most closely match the individual product line being discussed 
these changes were calculated  net of reinsurance  from statutory annual statement data found in schedule p of those statements  and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning of the year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities  all accident years combined  excluding non defense related claim adjustment expense 
data presented for the company includes history for the entire travelers group us companies only  whether or not the individual subsidiaries were originally part of spc or tpc 
this treatment is required by the statutory reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for schedule p 
comparable data for non us companies is not available 
general liability general liability is generally considered a long tail line  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a given accident year 
the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided  the jurisdiction and specific policy provisions such as self insured retentions 
there are numerous components underlying the general liability product line 
some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns with most of the claims for a given accident year closed within five to seven years  while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims eg  a reporting lag of a decade or more for construction defect claims 

table of contents while the majority of general liability coverages are written on an occurrence basis  certain general liability coverages such as those covering directors and officers or professional liability are typically insured on a claims made basis 
general liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components primary and excess umbrella  with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property damage 
bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder legal obligation arising from non intentional acts such as negligence  subject to the insurance policy provisions 
in some cases the damages can include future wage loss which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation and future medical treatment costs 
property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant private property arising from the policyholder legal obligation for non intentional acts 
in most cases  property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date  or soon thereafter 
in addition  sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately 
these exposures include asbestos  environmental  other mass torts  construction defect and large unique accounts that would otherwise distort the analysis 
these unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on conventional actuarial methods 
defense costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant  sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims 
for some products this risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs erodes the amount of policy limit available to pay the claim 
such defense within the limits policies are most common for claims made products 
when defense costs are outside of the limits  amounts paid for defense costs do not erode the policy limits 
this line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the united states excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk 
major contributors to this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag ie  the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim  the number of parties involved in the underlying tort action  whether the event triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods  the potential dollars involved in the individual claim actions  whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written ie  coverage dispute potential  and the potential for mass claim actions 
claims with longer reporting lags result in greater inherent risk 
this is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature  particularly where courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years  hence involving multiple defendants and their insurers and reinsurers and multiple policies thereby increasing the potential dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity 
claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag ie  the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and or latent claim exposure 
the amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line 
the components in this product line with the longest latency  longest reporting lags  largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental 
components that include latency  reporting lag and or complexity issues  but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental  include construction defect and other mass tort actions 
many components of general liability are not subject to material latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components 
in general  policies providing coverage with shorter reporting lags  fewer parties involved in settlement negotiations  only one policy potentially triggered per claim  fewer potential settlement dollars  reasonably foreseeable and stable potential hazards claims and no mass tort potential result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than policies without those characteristics 

table of contents in addition to the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section  the company utilizes various report year development and s curve methods for the construction defect components of this product line 
the construction defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for ibnr claim counts 
for components with greater lags in claim reporting  such as excess and umbrella components of this product line  the company relies more heavily on the bf method than on the paid and case incurred development methods

commercial property commercial property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability coverages  and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process except for more complex business interruption claims 
it is generally viewed as a moderate frequency  low to moderate severity line  except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties 
the claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk  except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims

the company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one year changes in reserve estimates for this product line 
commercial property reserves represent approximately of the company total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves 
since commercial property is considered a short tail coverage  the one year change for commercial property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines 
this is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for commercial property relates to the most recent accident year  which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines 
this recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to commercial property because of weather related events which  notwithstanding and experience  tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year  and generally are not completely resolved until the following year 
reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve 
the reserve estimates for this product line are also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for significant catastrophes such as the events of september   hurricane katrina and storm sandy 
the company change in reserve estimate for this product line was for  for and for the change primarily reflected better than expected development for accident years through  driven by favorable loss development related to catastrophe losses incurred in  and by higher subrogation and salvage recoveries for accident years through the change primarily reflected better than expected development in the and accident years for certain large national property and ocean marine exposures

commercial multi peril commercial multi peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and  therefore  includes both short and long tail coverages 
for property coverage  it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims  while for the other coverages  generally for the liability coverages  it takes a longer period of time to close claims 
the reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product  except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or large single losses 
the reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer 
commercial multi peril is generally sold to smaller sized accounts  while the customer profile for general liability and commercial property includes larger customers

workers compensation workers compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage  as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given accident year 
while certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly  some other payments are made over the course of several years  such as awards for permanent partial injuries 
in addition  some payments can run as long as the injured worker life  such as permanent disability benefits and on going medical care 
despite the possibility of long payment tails  the reporting lags are generally short  settlements are generally not complex  and most of the liability can be considered high frequency with moderate severity 
the largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency  high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from a worker injury  as such claims are subject to greater inflation risk 
overall  the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk 
workers compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components indemnity losses  medical losses and claim adjustment expenses

fidelity and surety fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage 
it takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle fidelity claims 
the volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured  the size and complexity of the insured business operations  amount of policy limit and attachment point of coverage 
the uncertainty surrounding reserves for small  commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions 
the high frequency  low severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates  whereas the low frequency  high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of ultimate loss outcomes 
actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency  high severity policies 
surety has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags  although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can result in a long settlement tail  based on the length and complexity of the construction project or commercial transaction being insured 
large construction projects can take many years to complete 
the frequency of losses in surety generally correlates with economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of an insured contractor to fulfill its contractual obligations 
the company actively seeks to mitigate this exposure to loss through disciplined risk selection and adherence to underwriting standards 
the volatility of surety losses is generally related to the type of business performed by the insured  the type of bonded obligation  the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses  such as unbilled contract funds  collateral  first and third party indemnity  and other security positions of an insured assets 
certain classes of surety claims are very high severity  low frequency in nature 
these can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large  complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures 
other claim factors affecting reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured eg  salvage and subrogation efforts and the results of financial restructuring of an insured

the principal component of other claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess of loss basis  which may include reinsurance of non us exposures  and is runoff business 
international and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages  currencies and jurisdictions countries 
the common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the individual component  and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the us statutory reporting framework 

table of contents due to changes in the business mix for this line over time  the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively short term due to both the products and the jurisdictions involved  eg  the republic of ireland and the united kingdom  while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely long tail eg  eg excess liabilities reinsured through the london market  and several underwriting pools in runoff 
the speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the specific coverage provided  the jurisdiction  the distribution system eg  underwriting pool versus direct and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard eg  insured and insurer located in different countries 
in particular  liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags  settlement lags and claim complexity  due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co insurers through a broker or lead insurer for claim settlement purposes 
international and other reserves are generally analyzed by program pool  country and general coverage category eg  eg liability excess of loss reinsurance  or general liability municipalities by country 
the business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage jurisdiction 
where the underlying insured hazard is outside the united states  the underlying coverages are generally similar to those described under the general liability and commercial property discussion above  provided that reserves relating to insured hazards outside the united states are analyzed taking into account differences in the legal environment and differences in terms and conditions  including  for example and where applicable  that in some jurisdictions there are no aggregate policy limits on certain liability coverages 
where the underlying hazard is within the us  the coverage involved is typically that of general liability and commercial property  but on an excess or excess of loss reinsurance basis 
excess exposure requires the insured to prove not only claims under the policy  but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess policy attachment point 
examples of common risk factors  or perceptions thereof  that could change and  thus  affect the required international and other reserves beyond those included in the general discussion section include international and other risk factors changes in claim handling procedures  including those of the primary carriers changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision new theories of liability trends in jury awards changes in the propensity to sue changes in statutes of limitations changes in the underlying court system distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues changes in tort law changes in claim adjuster office structure causing distortions in the data international and other book of business risk factors changes in policy provisions eg  deductibles  policy limits  endorsements  claims made language changes in underwriting standards product mix eg  size of account  industries insured  jurisdiction mix 
table of contents unanticipated changes in risk factors can affect reserves 
as an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for international and other excluding asbestos and environmental  a increase decrease in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a increase decrease in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves 
international and other reserves excluding asbestos and environmental represent approximately of the company total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves 
international and other represents a combination of different product lines  some of which are in runoff 
comparative historical information is not available for international product lines as insurers domiciled outside of the us do not file us statutory reports 
comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible one year changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business 
accordingly  the company has not included comparative analyses for international and other 
reinsurance recoverables the following table summarizes the composition of the company reinsurance recoverables at december  in millions gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses allowance for uncollectible reinsurance net reinsurance recoverables mandatory pools and associations structured settlements total reinsurance recoverables the million decline in net reinsurance recoverables since december  primarily reflected the impact of cash collections  including commutation agreements  and the impact of net favorable prior year reserve development 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability 
the company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  the company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers 
some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the company rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements 
the company employs dedicated specialists and aggressive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes 
some of the reinsurance agreements that the company entered into as part of its catastrophe bond programs are dual trigger contracts 
all of these contracts meet the requirements to be accounted for as reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts 
the company catastrophe bond programs are described in more detail in item business catastrophe reinsurance 
the company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 
the allowance is based upon the company ongoing review of amounts outstanding  length of collection periods  changes in reinsurer credit standing  disputes  applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors 
accordingly  the establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates 
from time to time  as a result of the long tailed nature of the underlying liabilities  coverage complexities and potential for disputes  the company considers the 
table of contents commutation of reinsurance contracts 
changes in estimated reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges 
recoverables attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims  of which workers compensation claims comprise a significant portion  for which the company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities 
recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate primarily to workers compensation service business 
these recoverables are supported by the participating insurance companies obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company voluntary market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant 
in the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool or association obligations  the other members share of such obligation increases proportionally 
on august   in a reinsurance dispute in new york state court captioned united states fidelity guaranty company v 
american re insurance company  et al  the trial court granted summary judgment for united states fidelity and guaranty company usf g  a subsidiary of the company  and denied summary judgment for american re insurance company  a subsidiary of munich re american re  and three other reinsurers 
by order dated october   the trial court corrected certain clerical errors and made certain clarifications to the august  order 
on october   judgment was entered against american re and the other three insurers  awarding usf g million  comprising million ceded under the terms of the disputed reinsurance contract plus interest of amounting to million as of that date 
the judgment  including the award of interest  was appealed by the reinsurers to the new york supreme court  appellate division  first department 
on january   the appellate division affirmed the judgment 
on january   the reinsurers filed a motion with the appellate division seeking permission to appeal its decision to the new york court of appeals  and on march   the appellate division granted the reinsurers motion 
on february   the court of appeals issued an opinion that largely affirmed the summary judgment in usf g favor  while modifying in part the summary judgment with respect to two discrete issues and remanding the case to the trial court for determination of those issues 
the company believes it has a meritorious position on each of these issues and intends to pursue its claim vigorously 
at december   the claim totaled million  comprising million of reinsurance recoverable plus interest which had grown to million as of that date 
interest will continue to accrue at until the claim is paid 
the million of reinsurance recoverable owed to usf g under the terms of the disputed reinsurance contract has been reported as part of reinsurance recoverables in the company consolidated balance sheet 
the interest that would be owed as part of any judgment ultimately entered in favor of usf g is treated for accounting purposes as a gain contingency in accordance with fasb topic  contingencies  and accordingly has not been recognized in the company consolidated financial statements 
investment valuation and impairments fair value measurements the company estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance 
the framework is based on the inputs used in valuation  gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available 
the disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable 
in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed  the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the company significant market assumptions 
the level in the fair value hierarchy 
table of contents within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety 
the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows level unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the company has the ability to access 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets  or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg  interest rates  yield curves  prepayment speeds  default rates  loss severities  etc 
or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable 
the unobservable inputs reflect the company own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use 
valuation of investments reported at fair value in financial statements the fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable  unrelated  willing parties  ie  not in a forced transaction 
the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale  eg  a forced transaction 
additionally  the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs  which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur 
for investments that have quoted market prices in active markets  the company uses the unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in level of the hierarchy 
the company receives the quoted market prices from a third party  nationally recognized pricing service pricing service 
when quoted market prices are unavailable  the company utilizes a pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value  which is mainly used for its fixed maturity investments 
the fair value estimates provided from this pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level of the hierarchy 
if quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable  the company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques  which  depending on the level of observable market inputs  will render the fair value estimate as level or level the company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it represents what a third party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm length transaction 
fixed maturities the company utilizes a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately of its fixed maturities 
the pricing service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets 
since fixed maturities other than us treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis  the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications  which include available relevant market information  benchmark curves  benchmarking of like securities  sector groupings and matrix pricing 
additionally  the pricing service uses an option adjusted spread model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
the pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information  relevant credit information  perceived market movements and sector news 
the market inputs utilized in the pricing evaluation  listed in the approximate order of priority  include benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  reference data  and industry and economic events 
the extent of the use of each market input depends on the 
table of contents asset class and the market conditions 
depending on the security  the priority of the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant 
for some securities  additional inputs may be necessary 
the pricing service utilized by the company has indicated that they will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation 
if the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment  the company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to make assumptions for market based inputs that are unavailable due to market conditions 
the fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes 
accordingly  the estimates of fair value for such fixed maturities  other than us treasury securities  provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in level of the hierarchy 
the estimated fair value of us treasury securities is included in the amount disclosed in level as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices 
the company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates to the company knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained are representative of the prices in the market 
in addition  the company has periodic discussions with the pricing service to discuss any changes in their process and reactions to overall markets 
the company produces a report monthly that lists all price changes from the previous month in excess of 
the company reviews the report and will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of fair value 
in addition  the company has implemented various other processes including randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution prices to the estimates from the pricing service as well as reviewing reports that contain securities whose valuation did not change from their previous valuation stale price review 
the company also uses an additional independent pricing service to further test the primary pricing service valuation of the company fixed maturity portfolio 
these processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair value estimates received from the pricing service 
the company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing service and  accordingly  estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates  credit spreads and liquidity 
the underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the us treasury curve are the bofa merrill lynch us corporate index and the bofa merrill lynch bb us high yield index 
the company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in level  since all significant inputs are market observable 
while the vast majority of the company municipal bonds and corporate bonds are included in level  the company holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and  accordingly  estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation 
due to the limited amount of observable market information  the company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in level the fair value of the fixed maturities for which the company used an internal pricing matrix was million and million at december  and  respectively 
additionally  the company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity investments that have characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing 
for these fixed maturities  the company obtains a quote from a broker primarily the market maker 
the fair value of the fixed maturities for which the company received a broker quote was million and million at december  and  respectively 
due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only  the company includes these fair value estimates in level 
table of contents non fixed maturities and other investments not reported at fair value see note of notes to the company consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the determination of fair value of non fixed maturities and valuation of investments not reported at fair value in the financial statements 
investment impairments the company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other than temporary impairments 
some of the factors considered in identifying other than temporary impairments include for fixed maturity investments  whether the company intends to sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value  for non fixed maturity investments  the company ability and intent to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities ie  whether there is a credit loss or cost for equity securities  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities or cost for equity securities  and the financial condition  near term and long term prospects for the issuer  including the relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices 
other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities and equity securities for fixed maturity investments that the company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company would not be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value  the company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss component in net realized investment gains losses 
the impairment related to all other factors is reported in other comprehensive income 
for equity securities including public common and non redeemable preferred stock and for fixed maturity investments the company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value  the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains losses 
upon recognizing an other than temporary impairment  the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the other than temporary impairment recognized in net realized investment gains losses 
the new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value  however  for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis and the expected cash flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment 
due to the subjective nature of the company analysis and estimates of future cash flows  along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis  it is possible that the company could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer 
additionally  it is possible that the issuer actual ability to meet contractual obligations may be different than what the company determined during its analysis  which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods

future application of accounting standards see note of notes to the company consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards updates 
the company is currently required to prepare its financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
during the last several years  the securities and exchange commission sec has been evaluating whether  when and how international financial reporting standards ifrs should be incorporated into the us financial reporting system 
before making a decision  the sec set forth a work plan to evaluate the remaining differences between gaap and ifrs  determine whether ifrs represented high quality standards  consider how the international accounting standards board is funded and its governance structure  and examine the variations in the way ifrs was applied by various foreign companies that file financial statements with the sec 
in july  the sec staff issued a final report on the sec work plan which concluded that ifrs provide high quality accounting standards  but also indicated concerns with funding  consistency of application and enforcement of ifrs globally 
the report did not give a recommendation to the sec on whether  when and how ifrs should be incorporated into the us financial reporting system 
additionally  the sec has not indicated a timeline for further consideration of incorporating ifrs 
the international accounting standards board iasb and the fasb are in the process of developing a global insurance standard that may involve methodologies for valuing insurance contract liabilities that may be significantly different from the methodologies required by current gaap 
in june  the fasb issued a statement that indicated that based on the nature and totality of differences between the fasb and iasb views  it is not likely that the two boards will achieve convergence on this project 
the fasb further noted that the fasb and iasb have very different perspectives on the project  given that the us has existing guidance on insurance contracts whereas there is currently no comprehensive ifrs insurance standard for insurance contracts 
as a result of this  it is currently unclear what changes  if any  may be made to the accounting for insurance contracts under gaap as a result of this project 
the fasb and the iasb also continue to complete three remaining projects intended to bring convergence between gaap and ifrs for revenue recognition  accounting for financial instruments and leasing 
these projects are expected to be completed by the end of the company is not able to predict whether it will choose to  or be required to  adopt ifrs or how the adoption of ifrs or the convergence of gaap and ifrs  including the joint project for valuing insurance contract liabilities may impact the company financial statements in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates inclusive of credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of the company primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are managed as of december  the company market risk sensitive instruments  including derivatives  are primarily entered into for purposes other than trading 
the carrying value of the company investment portfolio at december  and was billion and billion  respectively  of which and was invested in fixed maturity securities  respectively 
at both december  and  approximately of the company invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies 
the company exposure to equity price risk is not significant 
the company has no direct commodity risk and is not a party to any credit default swaps 
the primary market risks to the investment portfolio are interest rate risk and credit risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions 
for additional information regarding the company investments  see notes and of notes to the company consolidated financial statements as well as the investment portfolio and outlook sections of item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the primary market risk for all of the company debt is interest rate risk at the time of refinancing 
the company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach 
for additional information regarding the company debt see note of notes to the company consolidated financial statements as well as the liquidity and capital resources section of item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company foreign exchange market risk exposure is concentrated in the company invested assets  insurance reserves and shareholders equity denominated in foreign currencies 
cash flows from the company foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments denominated in foreign currencies 
the company purchases these investments primarily to fund insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency  effectively reducing its foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
invested assets denominated in the british pound sterling comprised approximately of the total invested assets at both december  and invested assets denominated in the canadian dollar comprised approximately and of the total invested assets at december  and  respectively 
invested assets denominated in other currencies at december  and were not material 
there were no other significant changes in the company primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period of time 
in the company sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
interest rate risk in this sensitivity analysis model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes the following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading fixed maturities  non redeemable preferred stocks  mortgage loans  short term securities  debt and derivative financial instruments 
the primary market risk to the company market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk inclusive of credit spreads 
the sensitivity analysis model uses various basis point changes in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
for invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk  estimates of portfolio duration and convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result from a parallel increase in interest rates 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put and interest rate reset features 
durations on tax exempt securities are adjusted for the fact that the yields on such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the us treasury curve 
fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued interest  using holdings as of december  and 
table of contents for debt  the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical december  and ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a basis point change  comparing such hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices  and multiplying the difference by the par or securities outstanding 
the sensitivity analysis model used by the company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately billion and billion based on a basis point increase in interest rates at december  and  respectively 
the loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that the company might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from emerging interest rate trends 
in addition  the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign denominated investments 
a hypothetical reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is used to estimate the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings 
the company analysis indicates that a hypothetical reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively
