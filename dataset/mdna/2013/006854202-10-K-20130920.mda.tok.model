item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
industry background there are many types of robots and one way to classify them is by functionality 
we classify the robots into two categories  industrial robots multi axis and mobile robots autonomous vehicles 
adept manufactures both types of robots and offers many options such as vision and automation control software and related hardware  parts feeding and enterprise level software 
each application typically has specific capability requirements and the broad technical depth at adept allows us to offer a diverse selection of products into existing and new high growth opportunities 
the industrial robots we supply are scara four axis selective compliance assembly robot arm articulated six axis quattro parallel linear module cartesian 
table of contents the mobile robots we supply are autonomous indoor vehicles autonomous outdoor vehicles autonomous material transfer solutions robotic automation continues to be a key enabler for a broad range of applications and industries 
adept robots are ideal in situations that are either hazardous or too repetitive tedious for non automated handling by humans  and applications that require high precision and speed 
key applications include manufacturing parts assembly handling parts food packages packaging transporting logistics warehouse order fulfillment testing dispensing applications semiconductor in a semiconductor fab  the two main challenges are the minimization of scrap from misprocessing and contamination  and the reduction of labor costs related to the manual handling of modules

as of june   we had employees engaged in research  development and engineering 
our research  development and engineering expenses were approximately million in fiscal  representing of revenues  and million in fiscal  representing of revenues 
manufacturing one of our core manufacturing strategies is to tightly control our supply of key parts  components  sub assemblies and outsourcing partners 
we primarily utilize vertical integration when we have proprietary internal capabilities that are not available from external sources in a cost effective manner 
we believe this is essential to maintain high quality products and enable rapid development and deployment of new products and technologies 
we provide customers with hour technical expertise and quality that is international organization for standardization iso certified at our principal manufacturing sites 
we have a strong commitment to quality and customer satisfaction 
we design and produce many of our own components and sub assemblies in order to retain intellectual property  performance and product innovation quality 
we have also outsourced certain components  sub assemblies and finished goods where we can maintain our high quality standards while improving our cost structure 
we proactively monitor single source supply parts  and we endeavor to ensure that adequate inventory is available to maintain manufacturing schedules should the supply of any part be interrupted 
although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole or limited source suppliers  we have not qualified a second source for some of these products and the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations and could damage customer relationships 
intellectual property because our success and competitiveness depends to an extent on the technical expertise  creativity  and knowledge of our personnel  we utilize patent  trademark  copyright  and trade secret protection to safeguard our competitive position 
at june   we had patents issued and current on various innovations in the field of robotics  motion control  and machine vision technology 
in addition  we use non disclosure agreements with customers  suppliers  employees  and consultants 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property by restricting access to proprietary information through a combination of technical and 
table of contents internal security measures 
there can be no assurance  however  that any of the above measures will be adequate to protect the proprietary technology of adept 
further  effective patent  trademark  copyright  and trade secret protection may be unavailable in certain foreign countries

risk factors 
table of contents our operating results fluctuate due to factors that are difficult to forecast  are often out of our control  and can be volatile 
our past operating results may not accurately indicate our future performance 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and could fluctuate in the future 
factors that may contribute to fluctuations include changes in aggregate capital spending  cyclicality and other economic conditions  or demand in the industries we serve  impact of our restructuring activities on our operations  management of our working capital  changes in our products market acceptance or demand  new products or changes in pricing  by us  our distribution channels  or our competitors  pricing and availability of components and raw materials  changes in our product mix from quarter to quarter affecting our gross margins  our failure to manufacture a sufficient volume of products in a timely and cost effective manner  our inability to decrease certain fixed costs and expenses to address changes in demand  currency exchange rate fluctuations  shifts in geographic concentration of our sales  seasonality  our ability to expand our product offerings  and extraordinary events such as litigation  claims  information security breaches or mergers and acquisitions 
we generally recognize revenues upon shipment  or in certain cases upon receipt by customers 
as a result  our net revenues and results of operations are affected by the timing of orders received and shipped 
a significant percentage of our shipments occur in the last month of each quarter  making reliable forecasting of demand level for our products for a particular quarter difficult 
further  an order cancellation  reduction or delay in shipments near the end of a fiscal period may cause sales to fall below expectations and harm our operating results for that period 
we have and may also enter into agreements requiring us to accept certain orders meeting agreed criteria and to hold specified levels of inventory available 
in fiscal  we shipped million of mobile products requiring customer acceptance as of june  we expect the volume of revenue requiring customer acceptance to decrease as mobile products become more widely used 
to address these difficulties  we periodically stock inventory levels of completed robots  machine controllers and certain strategic components 
as a result  our operating results vary  our stock price is volatile  and we may not be able to achieve or sustain our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow in the past  and have limited liquidity resources  which could impair our ability to invest in growth and adversely affect our operations 
we have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow  and if our projected revenue fails to increase or our expenses exceed current expectations  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  adequately respond to competitive pressures or fully execute our business plan 
in june  we raised approximately million in connection with our public offering of common stock  and in september  we raised approximately million of net proceeds  after estimated expenses  in connection with our redeemable convertible preferred stock financing 
these financings increased our cash resources and allowed us to pay off our previous line of credit  but our liquidity remains limited and restrictions and tax consequences may limit our access to existing cash balances from our foreign operations 
we have historically relied on a line of credit which expires in march and includes restrictions tied to the company accounts receivable 
we depend on the cash raised from our recent financings and funds generated from operating activities to sustain and grow our business 
our redeemable convertible preferred stock entitles holders to quarterly dividends  payable in cash or common stock  at a fluctuating rate of up to subject to increase on certain triggering events  provides for certain elective installment payments in cash or stock subject to certain equity conditions  and is redeemable in or upon certain trigger events 
we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital on favorable terms  it could undermine our ability to pursue expansion opportunities and could limit the working capital available to our business  harming 
table of contents our operating results 
our restructuring efforts may not be effective  might have unintended consequences  and could negatively impact our business 
we have restructured our operations in response to changes in the economic environment  our industry and demand  including restructuring programs in the second quarters of fiscal years and to streamline operations  consolidate facilities and reduce our work force 
during fiscal  we consolidated our denmark operations from our inmotx acquisition into our existing operations  incurring restructuring expenses in fiscal in fiscal  in response to a persistent decline in demand across the company target markets  we reduced our work force  streamlined operations and eliminated duplicate functions and non essential administrative services 
additionally  we are in the process of terminating our lease in wissous  france 
as part of this restructuring program  we reviewed and aligned our strategic priorities and rebalanced our investments to maintain sufficient liquidity and to focus on growth in our core competencies 
despite our planning  some cost cutting measures could have unexpected negative consequences  including loss of key personnel  or the loss of customers 
in connection with our restructurings  we have reduced our work force and experienced additional attrition  which may expose the company to legal claims against the company and loss of necessary human resources 
if we face costly employee or contract termination claims  our operations and prospects could be harmed 
while our restructuring efforts reduced  or are expected to reduce  our costs  we cannot be certain that all restructuring efforts will be successful or that we will not be required to implement additional restructuring activities in the future 
if we are unable to build and effectively integrate our new management team  our business could be harmed 
our management team  including our chief executive officer  is new and we are experiencing other significant personnel changes  including the addition of our chief business development and strategy officer  the addition of a vice president of mobile sales  the replacement of our vice president of north american sales and the addition of a vice president of asia and strategic programs 
integrating new management into existing operations always carries risk 
if we are unable to effectively build our new management team or integrate our new team members  our operations and prospects could be harmed 
we depend on outsourced manufacturing and information technology capabilities and single source suppliers  and if we experience disruptions in this supply or prices increase  our business may suffer 
we outsource most of our manufacturing functions  and obtain many key components  materials and mechanical sub systems from sole or single source suppliers 
we have limited contracts or guaranteed supply arrangements with these suppliers  and the lack of alternate sources and lengthy qualification process for replacement suppliers involves significant risks 
these risks include whether or not new suppliers will provide adequate quantities with sufficient quality on a timely basis  and the risk that supplier pricing may be higher than anticipated 
if we are unable to obtain necessary items on a timely basis  at acceptable prices  and of sufficient quality  we could lose current or future business 
in the past  we have experienced quality control or specification problems with certain components provided by sole source suppliers  and have had to design around flawed items 
any quality issues could result in customer dissatisfaction  lost sales  or increased warranty costs  and could harm our results of operations 
any significant price increase or disruption of our supply sources could interrupt our product shipments  require reengineering  and damage customer relationships 
if our suppliers cease manufacturing components that we require  we may need to purchase a significant amount of inventory that could lead to an increased risk of inventory obsolescence 
finally  if we incorrectly forecast product mix for a particular period and we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of any components or mechanical sub systems on a timely and cost effective basis due to long procurement lead times  our business could be substantially impaired 
global economic conditions currently affecting our customers and suppliers may also negatively affect our financial results by decreasing our revenues and increasing our risk of credit related losses 
the global economic downturn has created a widespread slowdown in capital investment  manufacturing  and demand for consumer products particularly in our disk drive and solar markets 
in response  our suppliers have or may increase their prices or reduce their output 
some of our customers including systems integrators have  and may continue to  defer  reduce or cease to place orders for our products  or may delay or default on their payment obligations  reducing our revenues or increasing our credit losses  which would negatively affect our financial results 

table of contents our inability to accurately forecast  or react quickly and adequately to increases or decreases in demand for our products could harm our business and results of operations 
intelligent automation systems using our products can range in price from  to  accordingly  our success depends upon the capital expenditure budgets of our customers  which tend to be cyclical 
the economic downturn resulted in cutbacks in capital spending in some of our major markets  and our business has been  and may continue to be  negatively affected 
industry downturns have been characterized by reduced demand for devices and equipment  production over capacity  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
during periods of declining demand  we have implemented several worldwide restructuring programs to realign our business and lower our expenses 
however  our ability to reduce expenses is limited by our need to retain and motivate key employees  and by our need for continued investment in product engineering  research and development 
we also have extensive ongoing customer service and support requirements  must maintain some inventory to satisfy potential customer commitments  and have certain fixed administrative costs 
further  our failure to effectively manage product transitions or accurately forecast customer demand  in terms of both volume and configuration  may lead to an increased risk of excess or obsolete inventory 
we also must maintain the ability to quickly increase our manufacturing capacity upon an increase in orders or general upturn in any of our markets 
typically  upturns in markets such as disk drive or electronics have been characterized by abrupt demand increases  and production under capacity 
we must be able to ramp up in times of increased demand and hire sufficiently to service our customers 
our international operations and reliance on foreign suppliers subject us to risks outside of our control that may harm our operating results 
we have significant and expanding operations outside the united states  including a presence in asia 
a substantial majority of our revenue is derived from non us sales international sales represented and of revenues for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we expect that revenue from our international sales and operations will continue to be a significant portion of our total revenue 
we also purchase some critical components from foreign suppliers 
as a result  our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international sales  purchases  and operations  including difficulties ensuring compliance with applicable regulatory regimes  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  political  military  and economic instability or turmoil  restrictive governmental actions  such as tariff regulations and other trade barriers  transportation costs and delays  local rules favoring local business and organized labor  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty collecting accounts receivables from foreign jurisdictions  potentially adverse tax rates and tax treatment of our intercompany transactions  and difficulty obtaining appropriate personnel 
we face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  as a significant portion of our revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies 
additionally  we make foreign currency denominated purchases from some suppliers  and thus remain subject to the transaction exposures that arise from foreign exchange movements between the date that the transactions are recorded and the date cash is paid 
continued fluctuations in foreign currencies could negatively impact us 
as we are subject to the regulatory regimes of numerous governments  we must ensure that our operations comply with all applicable requirements  including changing requirements affecting business and tax audits by foreign authorities 
it is not possible to assess the associated amount of financial or operational exposure at this time 
in  we opened a facility in shanghai  china to capitalize on significant opportunities presented by the asian markets 
we face all the risks inherent in operating in a foreign emerging market where we have not previously operated a facility 
our china based activities are subject to greater political  regulatory  legal and economic risks than those faced by other operations 
there can be no assurance that our operations in china will be successful 

table of contents the long sales cycle  customer evaluation and implementation processes of our products may increase the costs of securing sales and reduce the predictability of our earnings 
our products are technologically complex  and prospective customers generally must commit significant resources to test and evaluate performance  and to install and integrate our products into larger systems 
as a result  our sales process is often subject to evaluation and approval delays typically associated with large capital expenditures 
the sales cycles for our products often last for months or years  and orders expected in one quarter may shift to another or be canceled because of a customer budgetary constraints or internal acceptance reviews 
longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources in attempting to secure sales that may not be realized in the short term  and therefore may delay or prevent revenue generation 
the time required for our customers to incorporate our product into their system can also vary significantly  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
our failure to keep up with rapid technological change and new product development would harm our ability to compete 
the intelligent automation industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
we must anticipate trends in our customers industries and develop products before our customers products are commercialized  because many of our products are used by our customers to develop  manufacture  and test their own products 
if we do not accurately predict our customers needs  we may invest substantial development resources in products that do not achieve broad market acceptance 
further  if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products meeting customers changing technical specifications on a timely and cost effective basis  our products may become uncompetitive or obsolete 
we also must make decisions about whether or not to develop and offer products to a given market  and if our judgment of that market is incorrect  our business could be harmed 
the market for intelligent automation products is intensely competitive  which may make it difficult to grow our business or to maintain or enhance our profitability 
our competitors include robot  motion control  machine vision  and simulation software and packaging companies  many of which have substantially greater resources than we do 
our competitors in the robot market also include integrated manufacturers that produce robotics equipment for internal use  and also compete with our products for sales to other customers 
because they can generate substantial unit volumes to satisfy internal demand  these competitors may have greater pricing flexibility 
during the recent economic downturn  we experienced aggressive price reductions and other accommodations by our competitors  in addition to increased price sensitivity by our customers 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products are product features  functionality  and ease of use  price  brand quality perception  customer service  and timeliness  predictability  and reliability of delivery 
increased competitive pressure and declining barriers to market entry could result in a loss of sales or market share or force us to lower prices 
failure to enhance our brand would impair our ability to increase or maintain our customer base  and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
the growth of our business depends upon the successful development and commercial acceptance of our new products 
our failure to develop  manufacture  and sell new products in quantities sufficient to offset a decline in revenue from existing products or to successfully manage product and related inventory transitions could harm our business 
we depend upon a variety of factors to ensure that our new and enhanced products are successfully commercialized  including timely and efficient completion of design and development  implementation of manufacturing processes  and effective sales  marketing  and customer service 
because of the complexity of our products  significant delays may occur in introducing new products  or between a product s initial introduction and volume production 
the development and commercialization of new products involve many difficulties  including identifying new product opportunities  
table of contents retaining and hiring appropriate research and development personnel  determining the product s technical specifications  successfully completing the development process  successfully marketing the new product and achieving customer acceptance  managing inventory levels  and additional customer service and warranty costs associated with supporting new product introductions or affecting subsequent field upgrades 
we must expend significant financial and management resources to develop new products 
we cannot assure that we will receive meaningful revenue from these investments 
if we are unable to continue to successfully develop new products in response to customer requirements or technological changes  or our new products are not commercially successful  our business may be harmed 
our acquisitions of mobilerobots and inmotx expanded our business with new technologies and solutions for additional markets commencing in fiscal  including our adept pac solutions for complex food processing and packaging applications  and mobile robotic systems  control and software for autonomous robot and agv applications 
we had little or no experience in these markets prior to the completion of these acquisitions and are unable to accurately forecast the future commercial acceptance of these product lines 
in response to a decline in sales across our business beginning at the end of fiscal  we have focused our efforts on our core competencies and sources of revenue generation and have invested fewer resources in new businesses which take longer to build revenue 
in connection with our restructuring  we have focused on our core and mobile businesses and we have also altered our sales model for our packaging business to a channel focus 
this may negatively impact the growth of our new businesses and revenue potentially earned from related new products 
we generally have no long term customer contracts and our backlog cannot be relied upon as a future indicator of sales 
we generally do not have long term contracts with our customers  and existing contracts and purchase commitments may be canceled under certain circumstances 
as a result  we are exposed to competitive price pressures on every order  and our agreements with customers do not provide assurance of future sales 
our customers are not required to make minimum purchases and may cease purchasing our products at any time without penalty 
our backlog should not be relied on as a measure of anticipated demand or future revenue  because the orders constituting our backlog may be subject to changes in delivery schedules or cancellation without significant penalty to the customer 
any reductions  cancellations or deferrals in customer orders would negatively impact our business 
we market and sell our products primarily through an indirect channel comprised of third party resellers not under our control 
we believe that our ability to sell products to systems integrators and oems will continue to be important to our success 
however  our relationships with these partners are generally not exclusive  and we cannot control the timing or amount of their procurement or marketing of our products 
some systems integrators and oems who sell our products also sell products of our competitors 
if they choose to promote competing products or simply fail to market our products successfully  our revenue could decrease 
as we enter new geographic and applications markets  we must locate and establish relationships with systems integrators and oems to assist us in building sales in those markets 
because of product integration expenses and the large amount of training required  significant time and resources may be required to establish a profitable relationship with a systems integrator or oem 
we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining an effective relationship with new systems integrators or oems  which would adversely affect our business 
our acquisitions of mobilerobots and inmotx and any future acquisitions may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 
in fiscal and  respectively  we acquired mobilerobots and inmotx  and we may acquire other businesses and technologies to further our strategic objectives 
we had no prior experience with the autonomous robot and automated guided vehicle technologies market of mobilerobots and the gripping technology offered by inmotx 
these new businesses have required investment to introduce new products to customers 
to date  these new businesses have not produced revenues sufficient to fund these investments and to make these businesses successful 
we are unable to predict the market acceptance of 
table of contents any new additions to our business 
our acquisitions present risks  including significant expenditures of cash and dilutive stock issuances  difficulties in integrating product offerings  operations  or workforce  difficulties in establishing and maintaining effective uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the loss of key personnel or customers from either our current business or the acquired company s business  adverse effects on existing supplier relationships  disruptions of our on going businesses and diversion of resources and management attention  difficulties in realizing our financial and strategic objectives for the acquired business  negative impact on results of operations due to goodwill impairment write offs  amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill  or assumption of anticipated liabilities  risks of entering new markets  geographic areas  and distribution channels in which we have limited or no previous experience  and assumption of unanticipated liabilities  such as problems with the quality of the acquired company s product 
the risks above could significantly harm our business 
the failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or adequately address these risks could materially harm our financial results 
our products could have unknown defects which may give rise to claims against us  increase our expenses  or harm our reputation 
our products and enhancements are complex and  despite testing  may contain defects  errors or performance problems 
any defects or errors could result in expensive and time consuming design modifications or warranty charges  harmed customer relationships  and loss of market share 
newly released products  which have not seen as much use and testing in the marketplace as older products  are more susceptible to undetected defects 
as we aim to generate increasing revenues from sales of recently released products  the negative impact on our business resulting from defects in such products could be significant 
the existence of any defects  errors  or failures in our products could also lead to product liability claims against us  our channel partners  or our customers 
although we maintain product liability insurance  the coverage limits of these policies may not adequately cover future claims 
any claim could result in significant legal defense costs  divert resources  harm our reputation  and damage our business 
our failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology may impair our competitive advantage 
our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology and trade secrets 
we primarily rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret protection  licenses  and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights  but have not always sought patent  registration  or similar protection on our technology where it may have been available 
the steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property or to provide us with any commercial advantage 
the process of obtaining patent protection can be time consuming and costly  and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to uncertainty and litigation risks 
we may face costly intellectual property infringement claims 
allegations of intellectual property infringement by our products may arise and could include claims against us  our manufacturers  suppliers  or customers 
because there are numerous patents in the automation industry  it is not always practicable to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes intellectual property rights 
as a result  we may be forced to respond to intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights 
regardless of merit  these claims could consume management time  result in costly litigation  or cause product shipment delays 
in settling these claims  we may be required to cease selling products or services  pay damages  redesign the challenged technology  or enter into 
table of contents unfavorable royalty or licensing agreements 
any of these could seriously harm our business 
information security breaches or business system disruptions may adversely affect our business 
we rely on our information technology infrastructure and management information systems to run our business 
although we take measures to protect our information assets  our security measures may not detect or prevent every attempted breach 
we may be subject to information security breaches caused by  among other things  illegal hacking  computer viruses  or acts of vandalism or terrorism 
a breach could result in an interruption in our operations  unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information  unauthorized release of customer or employee data  violation of privacy or other laws  and exposure to litigation 
any such breach could materially harm our business and operating results 
our investments in certain new markets subject us to increased regulation and potential product liability  and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in these markets or that risks related to these industries will not have an adverse effect on our business 
our systems and controls are sold in a variety of industries  including semiconductor  packaging and medical  among others 
we have increased our strategic focus on sales for certain applications that are more highly regulated  including the automation of repetitive operations in diagnostic and pharmaceutical labs 
as we seek sales in the medical and food packaging industries  we must ensure that our products and systems comply with applicable regulatory requirements 
this will increase our costs and our failure to comply with these requirements could damage our ability to sell our products or subject us to regulatory actions or fines 
our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could harm our business 
we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  handling  and disposal of hazardous substances used in the manufacturing and assembly of our products 
we believe that we are in compliance with material environmental regulations and have all necessary environmental permits 
however  our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in penalties or liabilities  and could curtail our operations 
our success depends on our continuing ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly qualified personnel 
our inability to attract  train  motivate  and retain qualified management  sales  and technical personnel could adversely affect our ability to design  manufacture  market and sell our support and products  and to meet our requirements as a public company 
many companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater resources than we do 
in addition  in making employment decisions in the technology industry  job candidates often consider the value of the equity they receive in connection with their employment 
therefore  volatility in the price of our stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain technical personnel  which could harm our business 
compliance with recently passed health care legislation and potential increases in the cost of providing health care plans to our employees may adversely affect our business 
the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively  the acts became law in march the acts contain provisions that will affect employer sponsored health care plans  but it remains uncertain whether and by how much the acts will increase health care costs of employers 
significant annual increases in the cost of providing employee health coverage may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
if we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
under the sarbanes oxley act  our management must establish  maintain and make certain assessments and certifications regarding our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting 
we have dedicated significant resources to comply with these requirements  including significant actions to develop  evaluate  and test our internal controls  but cannot provide absolute assurances 
a failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in inaccurate or late reporting of our financial results  an investigation by regulatory authorities  a loss of investor confidence  a decrease in the trading price of our common stock and exposure to costly litigation or regulatory proceedings 

table of contents our preferred stock and the concentration of our equity ownership among few stockholders could adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our securities  and may permit a few stockholders to influence the results of stockholder decisions 
we have  shares of common stock and  shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding as of september  a small number of holders own the substantial majority of our outstanding equity 
these securities are generally freely tradable or subject to registration statements  permitting their sale with little or no restriction 
the potential sale of these securities creates meaningful overhang on the market for our securities and sales by any of these large holders would increase the current volatility of our common stock  the market price of which is affected by our low trading volume 
this may affect the trading market for our stock  and could control the results of matters requiring stockholder approval  which may delay or prevent a change of control or negatively affect our stock price 
our preferred stock is convertible into common stock at the option of the holder and upon certain mandatory conversion events and provides other rights of the holders to approve certain matters  including additional indebtedness  liens  dilutive or senior securities issuance or extraordinary transactions 
these approval rights could delay or prevent a change of control or other corporate actions and negatively affect our stock price 
stockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock may be depressed by future issuances of additional shares of our equity securities 
we issued  shares of our common stock in a public offering in june and  shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock in september we may issue additional common or preferred stock or other equity securities for various reasons  including to finance our operations  fund acquisitions or hire or retain employees 
issuances of our equity securities  or the perception that such issuances may occur  could dilute the interests of our stockholders and have a material negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
the rights and preferences of the preferred stock may decrease the perceived value  and thus the trading price  of our common stock 
the preferred stock is convertible at the holder option and the issuance of common stock upon such conversion could require us to issue a significant number of shares of our common stock and dilute existing shareholders 
at june   options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock were outstanding under our equity compensation plans  and approximately an additional  shares of common stock were reserved for future grant and issuance under such plans  a substantial majority of which was granted as part of our performance option program in august we can also issue shares under our employee stock purchase plan  which had approximately  shares available for issuance at june  shares of common stock issued under these plans are generally freely tradable in the public market  subject to certain limitations applicable to our affiliates 
option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases could increase the number of common shares outstanding and could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock  due to our low trading volume 
our use of equity to raise additional financing or as consideration in connection with a future acquisition or other transaction could also result in the dilution of our stockholders equity interest 
our stock price may fluctuate widely  making resale of our common stock difficult 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially 
our stock price may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to factors including fluctuating operating results  our liquidity needs and constraints  our restructuring activities and changes in management and other personnel  changes in our business focus and operational organization  our limited public float and the limited trading volume of our common stock on nasdaq  the business environment  including the operating results and stock prices of companies in the industries we serve  general conditions in the intelligent automation and packaging industries  the introduction of new products or changes in product pricing by us or our competitors  litigation or claims relating to the volatility of our common stock  internal controls  proprietary rights or other matters

the effects of new regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business 
in august  the sec adopted new requirements applicable to companies manufacturing or contracting for the manufacture of products which require specific minerals  known as conflict minerals 
such companies will have to disclose annually whether they used any conflict minerals originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries 
if a company uses conflict minerals from those countries  additional requirements will be triggered 
we must determine how we are affected by these new requirements 
we may face increased costs of regulatory compliance  potential risks to our reputation  difficulty satisfying any customers that insist on conflict free products and harm to our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we provide intelligent robotics systems  the cores of which are our motion controls systems  integrated vision guidance technology and application software 
they are sold in combination with our own proprietary robot mechanisms 
our vision guidance technology is tightly integrated with our motion controls technology  and this is a key differentiator for adept 
our two acquisitions described below have provided autonomous robot and fleet management capabilities that enhance our offerings for target markets  as well as unique gripping technology that expands our reach into the global food processing market 
in addition  we provide a full complement of robotics services and support for our customers 
through sales to systems integrators  oem partners and end user companies  we sell our robotics systems and services into a few broad industries where we believe we can provide the best solutions for particular applications 
we operate in two segments robotics and services and support 
acquisitions on january   we acquired inmotx  inc  a danish privately held provider of robotic platform solutions and gripping technology for the global food processing market 
pursuant to a merger agreement dated january   we paid million in cash  and issued  shares of our common stock to inmotx shareholders 
all of these shares were made subject to a holdback arrangement to secure the inmotx shareholder indemnity obligations for an eighteen month period 
we also issued  shares of our common stock to the inmotx chief technology officer  to vest on the third anniversary of the merger  contingent upon his continued employment by adept or a subsidiary  subject to certain exceptions for disability  termination without cause or termination for good reason or a change of control 
on september   the inmotx chief technology officer entered into a separation agreement with the company to terminate employment on january  of the  share grant issued upon the merger   shares were forfeited as of september   and the remaining  shares vested on june  in the third quarter of fiscal  we agreed upon indemnification amounts of  due from the former shareholders of inmotx relating to customer claims for matters arising prior to the acquisition by adept 
of the  shares issued on the merger date for the acquisition of inmotx   shares were forfeited by the holders and returned to adept in the fourth quarter of fiscal we also agreed to make certain contingent annual payments in cash to the former inmotx shareholders and to the chief technology officer in an amount equal to ten percent and two percent  respectively  of the revenues inmotx achieves in excess of specified thresholds during the three annual periods following the merger date  the fair value of which at june  was the results of inmotx s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since january  in october  we announced the decision to consolidate the inmotx operations in denmark into our pleasanton  california operations 
consolidation activities began during the second quarter of fiscal  and were completed by june  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of inmotx 
on june   we acquired mobilerobots inc  a privately held provider of autonomous robot and automated guided vehicle technologies based in new hampshire  pursuant to a merger agreement dated june   under which we paid approximately million in cash and issued  shares of our common stock 
we also agreed to pay bonus amounts in cash up to an aggregate  to employees of mobilerobots if certain mobilerobots product revenue targets were met for fiscal mobilerobots fiscal revenues met the minimum revenue threshold defined in the merger agreement  and a bonus of  was paid in the first quarter of fiscal the results of mobilerobots operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since june  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of mobilerobots 
strategy we strive to develop innovative and proprietary products and solutions that meet the needs of our customers and that are based on our core expertise in industrial robots  vision guidance and autonomous vehicle technologies 
in pursuit of our strategy  we intend to accelerate the launch of our mobile robot products into the global market our global markets for mobile products include small flexible manufacturing  semiconductor  logistics and warehousing 

table of contents revitalize our core business and expand our packaging channels with our softpic technology our global markets for our industrial products include small flexible manufacturing  food and packaging within our capacity range of lbs and below 
grow our services business offer our customers a broader selection of support mechanisms 
our actions in support of our strategy we intend to integrate strategic relationships from core markets that will drive volume and visibility 
a few of our recent wins include a million order in the small electronics market and equally large wins in the food market within north america 
these are two examples of this practice now beginning to take shape 
we intend to have collaborative new product market development for innovative products driving a change in our product mix 
we intend to continue to accelerate our service and support revenues with existing product offerings and new product offerings moving forward 
we have set country specific sales objectives to reduce our cost of selling our products as we grow our company 
we intend to introduce scalability in engineering  our supply chain  and our assembly and test process worldwide 
we continue to foster our culture by providing our employees with clear direction  a focus on accountability and execution  and bottom line cash 
trends in our business during fiscal  our revenues declined compared with the previous year 
this was driven primarily by weakened demand in some of our traditional markets such as solar and disk drives and by weak economic climates in north america and europe  most notably france 
we saw bright spots in the small parts manufacturing areas  in particular the consumer electronics business in europe and asia 
we received a large order for both cobras and vipers for installation in a world leading electric razor manufacturer in the netherlands as they added capacity for new products 
we also received a large order from a new customer in taiwan for cobras which will be used for precision assembly of smart phone components 
as a result of our continued focus in the food processing sector  adept won business with two tier i food companies  both headquartered in the united states 
one company will utilize adept products related to chicken processing and the other company will integrate our products into a complex packaging process 
both customers selected adept as a result of our ability to reduce their labor costs while improving their product quality 
we believe both customers will have significant long term relationships with adept 
we have been pleased with the reception of our new generation of mobile robots announced in january at the automate show in chicago 
over the latter half of the fiscal year an existing semiconductor customer ordered additional handlers  increasing their adept robot installed base to units 
a well known luxury watch manufacturer  ordered two lynx products 
we believe this is the start of a long term relationship with this customer 
we also received an order for two lynx products from a leading lift truck manufacturer 
we believe that this has the potential to become a strategic relationship 
on a geographic basis  our us sales declined in fiscal compared with the prior year and accounted for of total revenue in fiscal compared to in the previous year 
the decrease in us sales was primarily due to lower sales of mobile solutions for universities and labs and lower sales in the packaging markets 
in asia  sales declined in fiscal compared with the prior year and accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in the previous year 
the decrease is asia sales was primarily due to lower sale to disk drive equipment manufacturers as this market entered a cyclical downturn 
european sales declined in fiscal compared with the previous year and accounted for of total revenues for both fiscal and fiscal the decrease in european sales was primarily due to a weaker economic environment across most of the company european markets  particularly in france 
restructuring and cost reduction actions 
table of contents operationally  from time to time we have undertaken restructuring and other cost reduction actions to support our business model 
we continue to emphasize cost efficiency balanced with investments in our products and revenue generating activities 
we remain committed to managing our business to generate cash 
during fiscal  we incurred million in restructuring charges  primarily due to severance costs related to a reduction in work force and from terminating our lease in wissous  france 
in october  we announced the decision to consolidate the inmotx operations in denmark into the company pleasanton  california operations 
consolidation activities began during the second quarter of fiscal  and were completed by june  summary of the fiscal fourth quarter revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal were million  down from million for the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of weakened demand in our european and us markets  partially offset by strong fourth quarter sales in our asian markets 
gross margin was of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared with of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin in the fiscal fourth quarter was favorably impacted by a higher margin product mix and lower manufacturing direct cost

robotics segment revenues were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal lower robotics revenues in fiscal were primarily due to a cyclical downturn across our markets  a continuing weak economy in europe  decreased levels of capital investment in the solar and disk drive markets and delays of orders for our packaging automation solutions 
revenues in our services and support segment were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal 
table of contents the decrease during fiscal was primarily due to a cyclical downturn across our markets

our international revenues were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal this decrease resulted from a decrease in sales in our european markets  a decrease in our asian markets  and a decrease in sales to all other international countries 
european sales in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal the decrease in european sales was primarily due to a weaker economic environment across most of the company european markets impacting sales in both our robotics segment and our services and support segment 
revenues from asia in fiscal decreased to million compared with million in fiscal as a result of lower disk drive equipment sales as this market entered a cyclical downturn  partially offset by sales increases in the appliance and consumer electronics sectors 
revenues from other countries in fiscal decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of lower sales to the packaging market 
backlog 
our product backlog at june  was approximately million compared to approximately million at june  the decrease in backlog at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal was due to a slowdown in customers ordering patterns at the end of fiscal  especially in europe 
orders with delivery dates beyond twelve months from the end of the fiscal quarter are not included in backlog  and thus we expect substantially all backlog at june  to ship during fiscal because orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules and in certain instances may be subject to cancellation without significant penalty to the customer  our backlog at any date may not be indicative of demand for our products or actual revenues for any period in the future 
gross margin the following table sets forth our gross margin and year to year change in gross margin for the fiscal years ended june  and in thousands  except for percentages 
table of contents fiscal change to fiscal revenues gross margin gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal gross margin in fiscal was unfavorably affected by an  charge for an increase in excess and obsolete inventory reserves related to our packaging products in the second fiscal quarter due to lower demand and product obsolescence 
we may experience significant fluctuations in our gross margin percentage from period to period due to changes in volume  changes in availability of components  changes in product configuration  increased price based competition  changes in our sales mix and or changes in operating costs 
in particular  we expect that sales into the disk drive market will continue to have a negative impact on gross margin  while packaging and mobile sales will have a positive effect 
in addition  we expect that changes in currency valuations will continue to impact gross margin  as a significant portion of our revenues are in euro and a portion of our components are paid for in japanese yen 
operating expenses research  development and engineering the following table sets forth our research  development and engineering expenses and the year to year change in these expenses for the fiscal years ended june  and in thousands  except for percentages fiscal change to fiscal expenses percentage of revenue research  development and engineering r d costs are expensed as incurred  with the exception of software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility and up to the general release of the software products that are capitalized 
technological feasibility is demonstrated by the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over either two or three years  based on the estimated life of the product 
r d expenses in fiscal were million  or of revenues  a decrease of from million  or of revenues  in fiscal lower r d expenses in fiscal compared with the prior year primarily resulted from the consolidation of the inmotx operations in denmark into the company pleasanton  california operations and cost cutting measures undertaken during the second quarter of fiscal we do not expect r d expenses in fiscal to increase significantly from fiscal levels

amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization expense totaled  during fiscal and  during fiscal these expenses are related to amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the mobilerobots acquisition in the fourth quarter of and the inmotx acquisition in the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal stock based compensation expense 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal related to our stock option plans  employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants 
stock based compensation expense in fiscal and includes and  respectively  of accelerated stock based compensation expense related to employee terminations that were part of our restructuring activities  and then were recorded as restructuring expense 
in fiscal  we expect stock based compensation expense may increase from fiscal levels due to grants and vesting of restricted stock granted under our fiscal performance option program awards and options granted and to be granted to our ceo and other senior management in fiscal see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our recognition of stock based compensation expense 
restructuring charges 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million  primarily due to severance costs associated with a reduction in work force 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to the consolidation of the inmotx operations in denmark into the company pleasanton  california operations 
operating loss 
we recorded an operating loss of million in fiscal  compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal higher operating losses recorded in fiscal were primarily the result of lower revenues and margin compared to fiscal  an intangible and goodwill impairment charge of million during the second fiscal quarter of related to the inmotx acquisition and an  excess and obsolete inventory charge related to our packaging products in the second quarter of fiscal interest income expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  was  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal the decrease in interest expense during fiscal primarily resulted from the payoff of our line of credit balances during fiscal that was enabled by the proceeds received from the private placement of redeemable convertible preferred stock in the second quarter of fiscal foreign currency exchange gain loss 
our foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated at current period ending exchange rates and statements of operations accounts are translated at the average rate for the period 
translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
foreign currency transaction losses were  in fiscal and  in fiscal the foreign currency transaction losses recorded in fiscal were not significant 
the foreign currency transaction losses recorded in fiscal year were primarily generated from realized losses related to the payments of intercompany payables in us dollars by the european entities 
as the euro decreased against the us dollar  more euros were needed to purchase the us dollar to settle the payable 
as we conduct business on a global basis we are continually exposed to adverse or beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates  which can vary considerably from period to period 
the dollar euro and the dollar yen markets currently present the largest exchange rate risk for adept 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
adept typically provides for income taxes during interim reporting periods based upon an estimate of our annual effective tax rate 
we also maintain a liability to cover the cost of additional tax exposure items on the filing of federal and state income tax returns as well as filings in foreign jurisdictions 
each of these filing jurisdictions may audit the tax returns filed and propose adjustments 
adjustments arise from a variety of factors  including different interpretations of statutes and regulations

the ability to require this installment conversion requires that adept i maintain on deposit such amount of cash and cash equivalents and ii satisfies such ebitda threshold  in each case as is mutually determined by adept and silicon valley bank and reasonably acceptable to hale capital partners which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed 
if adept cannot convert the preferred stock due to its failure to satisfy such conditions  then it may redeem the shares for cash at the same price subject to agreement of the preferred stockholder 
the amended and restated loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank requires no ebitda or cash threshold for conversion  but does require a minimum ebitda and cash threshold at the end of the quarter preceding an installment cash redemption 
upon certain triggering events  such as bankruptcy  insolvency or a material adverse effect or failure of adept to issue shares upon conversion of the preferred stock in accordance with its obligations  the preferred stockholders may require adept to redeem all or some of the preferred stock at a price equal to of the conversion amount  and in the event certain equity conditions are not satisfied during a certain period  the greater of i the conversion amount being redeemed and ii the product of the conversion amount being redeemed and the quotient determined by dividing the highest trading price of the common stock underlying the preferred stock during the period beginning on the date immediately preceding such triggering event and ending on the date of the preferred stockholder delivers a redemption stock notice by the conversion price  plus accrued and unpaid dividends

silicon valley bank line of credit the company has a revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank  or svb 
adept originally entered into the loan and security agreement and related agreements for the revolving line in may  and entered into an additional loan and security agreement ex im loan facility and related agreements in march on march   adept and svb entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement for the domestic portion of the revolving line  a new loan and security agreement ex im loan facility  which replaced the expiring agreement for the portion of the revolving line guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states the ex im sublimit  and related loan agreement amendments 
the ex im sublimit permits adept to borrow against foreign accounts receivable and export related inventory 
pursuant to the loan agreements  adept may borrow up to million net of borrowings under the ex im sublimit  at an advance rate  against eligible domestic accounts receivable that svb has specifically agreed to finance 
under the ex im sublimit  adept may borrow up to million against eligible foreign accounts receivable at specified advance rates of or  depending on the currency in which the receivable is payable  and eligible export related inventory at a advance rate  in each case that svb has specifically agreed to finance 
the advance rates are subject to adjustment in svb discretion 
the loan agreements specify the criteria for determining eligible accounts receivable and inventory  and ongoing conditions precedent to adept ability to borrow under the line of credit 
the maturity date of the svb line of credit is march  the maximum aggregate borrowing under the loan agreements may not exceed million  and the face amount of financed domestic accounts receivable may not exceed million 
the 
table of contents amount of export related inventory advances outstanding at any time may not exceed the lesser of million or of the outstanding obligations under the ex im sublimit 
if outstanding obligations at any time exceed any of these limits  adept must repay the excess 
accounts receivable and inventory financed by svb will bear interest or a finance charge equal to svb announced prime rate plus per annum 
the applicable interest or finance charge is calculated based on the full face amount of financed accounts receivable  and the gross amount of financed export related inventory  rather than the actual amount of the advances 
adept is no longer required to meet financial covenants tied to maintaining minimum liquidity or minimum ebitda  but remains obligated to comply with various other covenants 
adept must repay advances against accounts receivable  together with related finance charges  when it receives payment on the financed receivables or earlier as specified in the loan agreements  and must repay all outstanding obligations under the line of credit on the maturity date 
adept is required to maintain its primary operating deposit accounts with svb  and to direct all customers to transmit payments to a lockbox account at svb 
provided that there is no event of default under the line  svb will apply collections from the lockbox to repayment of the financed accounts receivables  accrued finance charges and bank expenses  and transfer the remaining proceeds to adept designated deposit account with svb 
in april  adept paid facility fees of  to svb and  in other bank expenses in connection with entry into the loan agreements 
during the second quarter of fiscal  adept repaid the remaining outstanding loan balance under the revolving line of credit 
adept was in compliance with the covenants in the loan documents as of june  at june   adept had no outstanding principal balance under the revolving line 
adept believes that its current cash and cash equivalents  together with funds available pursuant to its credit facility  provide sufficient liquidity for operations in fiscal based on operating needs  strategic activities and other factors  we may further utilize the line of credit in the future or seek alternative credit or other financing in the future to pursue additional expansion opportunities or make other investments in our growth 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  including capitalized software development costs  of million and million net of amortization at june  and  respectively  million and million of goodwill and other intangible assets net of amortization at june  and  respectively and million and million in long term other assets at june  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to warranty obligations  bad debt  inventories  cancellation costs associated with long term commitments  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  service contracts  stock based compensation  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates and judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates  by their nature  are based on judgment and available information 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  and it is possible that such changes could occur in the near term 
we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to our consolidated financial statements while considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
these critical accounting policies described below include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  
table of contents warranties  capitalization of software development costs  accounting for income taxes  foreign currency accounting  goodwill and purchased intangible assets  valuation of stock based awards  and commitments and contingencies 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of production automation equipment and parts  and to a lesser extent from support and service activities associated with this equipment 
non software product revenue consists primarily of sales of robots  refurbished robots and spare parts 
we recognize non software product revenue when persuasive evidence of a non cancelable arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  legal title and economic risk is transferred to the customer  and when an economic exchange has taken place 
we use the signed purchase contract or purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
product revenues are normally recognized at the point of shipment from our facilities since title and risk of loss passes to the customers at that time 
customers generally have no right of return other than for product defects covered by our warranty 
adept maintains a warranty liability based on our historical warranty experience and management s best estimate of our warranty liability at each balance sheet date 
there are no acceptance criteria on our standard non software products 
however  when the company introduces new products that have not been proven to meet industry standards or sells products to customers requiring custom modifications of our standard products or agrees to meet performance specifications or make payment contingent upon customer acceptance  the company will defer the revenue until industry standards  customer modifications or performance specifications are met or customer acceptance has been obtained 
we do not deem the fee to be fixed or determinable where a significant portion of the price is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from the invoice date 
in recording revenue  management exercises judgment about the collectability of receivables based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if we conclude that collection is not reasonably assured for any reason  then the revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is removed 
our experience is that we have been able to reliably determine whether collection is reasonably assured 
our robots and controllers have features that are enabled or enhanced through the use of software enabling tools and other software elements  which are embedded within our robot and controller products 
our software enabling tools or other software elements do not operate independently of the robots or controllers  and they are not sold separately and cannot be used without the robots or controllers 
we also sell optional software used to enhance capability of our products 
we believe that the software component of our products is incidental to our products and services taken as a whole 
service and support revenue consists primarily of sales of spare parts and refurbished robots 
service revenue also includes training  consulting and customer support  the latter of which includes all field service activities  ie  maintenance  repairs  system modifications or upgrades 
revenues from training and consulting are recognized at the time the service is performed and the customer has accepted the work 
these revenues are not essential to the product functionality and  therefore  do not bear on the revenue recognition policy for our component products 
deferred revenues represent payments received from customers in advance of the delivery of products and or services  or before the satisfaction of all revenue recognition requirements enumerated above  as well as cases in which we have invoiced the customer but cannot yet recognize the revenue for the same reasons discussed above 
revenue for robot refurbishment relates to adept owned or customer owned refurbished robots and components 
we receive parts returned from customers under warranty contracts  or we purchase surplus used parts available from customers or suppliers 
these parts traditionally have lower cost  and internal analysis indicates that on average  we pay a significantly lower percentage of the new part cost to acquire these components 
the standard cost for acquired parts is therefore set at such percentage of cost in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requiring valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market 
by contrast  the cost basis starting point for customer owned refurbished or repaired robots is zero since we do not own the robots 
for all refurbishment and remanufacturing  we track all related costs and activities materials and labor required to bring the robots up to standard using work orders 
this revenue stream is included within our services and support segment 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer 
management specifically 
table of contents analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not request collateral from our customers 
however  we may require customers to make payments in advance of shipment or provide a letter of credit under certain circumstances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our policy is to record specific allowances against known doubtful accounts 
an additional allowance is also calculated based on of the company total accounts receivable  net of specific allowances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers and  should the default rate change or the financial positions of our customers change  we may increase this additional allowance percentage 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or market value 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes  among other factors  a review of component demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans  and quality issues 
as a result of this assessment  we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated liquidation value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
manufacturing inventory includes raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
the inventory valuation provisions are based on an inventory report which includes all inventories and which identifies quantities on hand in excess of two year s projected demand 
individual line item exceptions are identified for either inclusion or exclusion from the inventory valuation provision 
the materials accounting functions monitor the line item exceptions and make adjustments as necessary 
warranties 
our warranty policy is included in our terms of sale  generally as a two year parts and one year labor limited warranty on most hardware and component products  and states that there are no rights of return  and that a refund may be made at our discretion  and only if there is an identified fault in the product and the customer has complied with our approved maintenance schedules and procedures  and the product has not been subject to abuse 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  and costs per claim for repair or replacement 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our components suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service labor and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  service labor or delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to those estimates are made 
capitalization of software development costs 
we capitalize certain software development costs 
we begin capitalizing software development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility  which is established upon the completion of a working model or a detailed program design 
costs incurred prior to technological feasibility are charged to expense as incurred 
capitalization ceases when the product is considered available for general release to customers 
capitalized software development costs are amortized to costs of revenues over the estimated economic lives of the software products based on product life expectancy 
generally  estimated economic lives of the software products do not exceed three years 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to compute income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
in assessing the valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income 
our net deferred tax assets relate predominantly to our united states tax jurisdiction 
we currently maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in the united states and denmark 
the valuation allowance was determined using an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
our us loss  among other considerations  provides negative evidence and accordingly  a substantial valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a substantial valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 

table of contents we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including related interest  is adequate 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to record additional income tax expense or establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
foreign currency accounting 
each of our non us subsidiaries uses its respective local currency as the functional currency 
our foreign subsidiaries balance sheet accounts are translated at current period ending exchange rates and statements of operations accounts are translated at the average rate for the period 
translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from transactions  including intercompany balances not considered to be a permanent investment  denominated in currencies other than an entity s functional currency are included in foreign currency exchange loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
we do not currently apply a hedging strategy against our currency positions 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
acquisition related intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their economic lives 
goodwill is measured and tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company determined that intangible assets related to the company inmotx acquisition had been impaired and recorded a million write down of their intangibles 
triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends  restructuring actions  lower projections of profitability  or a sustained decline in our market capitalization 
the company is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the company determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount 
we have defined our reporting units at the business unit level  one level below our reportable segments 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and forecasted operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
future competitive  market and economic conditions could negatively impact key assumptions including our market capitalization or the carrying value of our net assets which could require us to realize an impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets 
a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
the second step of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists  and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit and if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill  an impairment exists and is recorded 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as significant decreases in the market price  reductions in demand  lower projections of profitability  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of acquired assets  or significant negative industry or economic trends  indicate that the net book value of an asset may not be recovered through expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition 
if this review indicates the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value and the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized by writing down the impaired asset to its fair value  which is typically calculated using i quoted market prices and or ii discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate 
valuation of stock based awards 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period of the individual equity instrument 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes calculation for option grants is based on historical volatility as options on our stock are not traded 
when establishing the expected life assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

table of contents commitments and contingencies 
we evaluate potential commitments and contingencies based on their anticipated outcome 
if we determine  after consideration of all known facts and consultation with legal counsel  that a loss related to the potential matter is neither probable or cannot be reasonably estimated as of the date of issuance of our fiscal period end reports  we do not accrue for the potential liability 
if a loss is reasonably possible related to the matter  we will disclose the relevant facts of the matter along with an estimated loss amount or range if such amount or range can be reasonably estimated
