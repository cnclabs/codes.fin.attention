our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio 
this investment strategy is supported by our short term financing arrangements necessary to satisfy short term funding requirements relating to client funds obligations

the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of june  in millions payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years unknown total debt obligations operating lease and software license obligations purchase obligations obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits other long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets compensation and benefits acquisition related obligations total these amounts represent the principal repayments of our debt and are included on our consolidated balance sheets 
the estimated interest payments due by the corresponding period above are million  million  million  and million  respectively  which have been excluded 
included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment  as well as the licensing of software 
the majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices 
our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements 
purchase obligations are comprised of a million reinsurance premium with ace american insurance company for the fiscal policy year  as well as obligations related to purchase and maintenance agreements on our software  equipment  and other assets 
we made the determination that net cash payments expected to be paid within the next months  related to unrecognized tax benefits of million at june   are expected to be up to million 
we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates as to the period beyond the next months in which cash payments related to unrecognized tax benefits are expected to be paid 
compensation and benefits primarily relates to amounts associated with our employee benefit plans and other compensation arrangements 
these amounts exclude the estimated contributions to our defined benefit plans  which are expected to be million in fiscal acquisition related obligations relate to deferred purchase consideration payments at future dates 
a liability is established at the time of the acquisition for these fixed payments 
in addition to the obligations quantified in the table above  we had obligations for the remittance of funds relating to our payroll and payroll tax filing services 
as of june   the obligations relating to these matters  which are expected to be paid in fiscal  total  million and were recorded in client funds obligations on our consolidated balance sheets 
we had  million of cash and marketable securities that have been impounded from our clients to satisfy such obligations recorded in funds held for clients on our consolidated balance sheets as of june  adp indemnity provides workers compensation and employer liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services worksite employees up to a million per occurrence 
peo services has secured specific per occurrence and aggregate stop loss insurance from a wholly owned and regulated insurance carrier of aig that covers all losses in excess of the million per occurrence and also any aggregate losses within the million retention that collectively exceed a certain level in each policy year 
should aig and its wholly owned insurance company be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations  adp would become responsible for satisfying these worksite employee workers compensation obligations 
we utilize historical loss experience and actuarial judgment to determine the estimated claim liability for the peo services business 
premiums are charged to peo services to cover the claims expected to be incurred by the peo services worksite employees 
changes in estimated ultimate incurred losses are recognized by adp indemnity 
adp indemnity paid a premium of million in july to enter into a reinsurance agreement with ace american insurance company to cover substantially all losses for the fiscal policy year on terms substantially similar to the fiscal reinsurance policy to cover losses up to the million per occurrence related to the workers compensation and employer liability deductible reimbursement insurance protection for peo services worksite employees

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our overall investment portfolio is comprised of corporate investments cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  and long term marketable securities and client funds assets funds that have been collected from clients but not yet remitted to the applicable tax authorities or client employees 
our corporate investments are invested in cash and cash equivalents and highly liquid  investment grade marketable securities 
these assets are available for repurchases of common stock for treasury and or acquisitions  as well as other corporate operating purposes 
all of our short term and long term fixed income securities are classified as available for sale securities 
our client funds assets are invested with safety of principal  liquidity  and diversification as the primary goals 
consistent with those goals  we also seek to maximize interest income and to minimize the volatility of interest income 
client funds assets are invested in highly liquid  investment grade marketable securities  with a maximum maturity of years at the time of purchase and money market securities and other cash equivalents 
at june   approximately of the available for sale securities categorized as us treasury and direct obligations of us government agencies were invested in senior  unsecured  non callable debt directly issued by the federal home loan banks and federal farm credit banks 
we utilize a strategy by which we extend the maturities of our investment portfolio for funds held for clients and employ short term financing arrangements to satisfy our short term funding requirements related to client funds obligations 
our client funds investment strategy is structured to allow us to average our way through an interest rate cycle by laddering the maturities of our investments out to five years in the case of the extended portfolio and out to ten years in the case of the long portfolio 
as part of our client funds investment strategy  we use the daily collection of funds from our clients to satisfy other unrelated client funds obligations  rather than liquidating previously collected client funds that have already been invested in available for sale securities 
we minimize the risk of not having funds collected from a client available at the time such client s obligation becomes due by impounding  in virtually all instances  the client s funds in advance of the timing of payment of such client s obligation 
as a result of this practice  we have consistently maintained the required level of client funds assets to satisfy all of our obligations 
there are inherent risks and uncertainties involving our investment strategy relating to our client funds assets 
such risks include liquidity risk  including the risk associated with our ability to liquidate  if necessary  our available for sale securities in a timely manner in order to satisfy our client funds obligations 
however  our investments are made with the safety of principal  liquidity  and diversification as the primary goals to minimize the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy all of our client funds obligations 
we also believe we have significantly reduced the risk of not having sufficient funds to satisfy our client funds obligations by consistently maintaining access to other sources of liquidity  including our corporate cash balances  available borrowings under our billion commercial paper program rated a by standard and poor s and prime p by moody s  the highest possible credit ratings  our ability to execute reverse repurchase transactions billion of which is available on a committed basis  and available borrowings under our billion committed revolving credit facilities 
in august  the company increased the us short term commercial paper program to provide for the issuance of up to billion in aggregate maturity value 
the reduced availability of financing during periods of economic turmoil  even to borrowers with the highest credit ratings  may limit our ability to access short term debt markets to meet the liquidity needs of our business 
in addition to liquidity risk  our investments are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk  as discussed below 
we have established credit quality  maturity  and exposure limits for our investments 
the minimum allowed credit rating at time of purchase for corporate and canadian provincial bonds is bbb  for asset backed securities is aaa  and for municipal bonds is a 
the maximum maturity at time of purchase for bbb rated securities is years  for single a rated securities is years  and for aa rated and aaa rated securities is years 
time deposits and commercial paper must be rated a and or p money market funds must be rated aaa aaa mf 
details regarding our overall investment portfolio are as follows dollars in millions years ended june  average investment balances at cost corporate investments funds held for clients total average interest rates earned exclusive of realized gains losses on corporate investments funds held for clients total realized gains on available for sale securities realized losses on available for sale securities net realized gains on available for sale securities impairment losses on available for sale securities as of june net unrealized pre tax gains on available for sale securities total available for sale securities at fair value we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to securities that mature  as the proceeds from maturing securities are reinvested 
factors that influence the earnings impact of the interest rate changes include  among others  the amount of invested funds and the overall portfolio mix between short term and long term investments 
this mix varies during the fiscal year and is impacted by daily interest rate changes 
the annualized interest rates earned on our entire portfolio decreased approximately basis points  from for fiscal to for fiscal a hypothetical change in both short term interest rates eg  overnight interest rates or the federal funds rate and intermediate term interest rates of basis points applied to the estimated average investment balances and any related short term borrowings would result in approximately a million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve month period ending june  a hypothetical change in only short term interest rates of basis points applied to the estimated average short term investment balances and any related short term borrowings would result in approximately a million impact to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes over the ensuing twelve month period ending june  we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the securities 
we limit credit risk by investing in investment grade securities  primarily aaa and aa rated securities  as rated by moody s  standard poor s  and for canadian securities  dominion bond rating service 
approximately of our available for sale securities held a aaa or aa rating at june  in addition  we limit amounts that can be invested in any security other than us and canadian government or government agency securities 
we operate and transact business in various foreign jurisdictions and are therefore exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes 
during fiscal   and  dealer services earned   and  respectively  of its segment revenues from continuing operations from one client 
we did not have any customers that individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue from continuing operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the company adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu requires entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements of net earnings  and other comprehensive income 
the company has elected to present net earnings and other comprehensive income on two separate  but consecutive statements 
the adoption of asu did not have an impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
in july  the company adopted asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based upon the qualitative assessment  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
asu does not change how goodwill is calculated or assigned to reporting units  nor does it revise the requirement to test goodwill annually for impairment 
the adoption of asu did not have an impact on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial condition  other comprehensive income  or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
asu requires entities to disclose the amount of income loss reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to each respective line item on the income statement 
the guidance allows companies to elect whether to disclose the reclassification either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements  including cross referencing other disclosures which provide additional details about these amounts 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of asu will not have an impact on the company consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
the estimates are based on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are primarily attributable to fees for providing services eg  employer services payroll processing fees as well as investment income on payroll funds  payroll tax filing funds and other employer services client related funds 
we enter into agreements for a fixed fee per transaction eg  number of payees or number of payrolls processed 
fees associated with services are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
our service fees are determined based on written price quotations or service agreements having stipulated terms and conditions that do not require management to make any significant judgments or assumptions regarding any potential uncertainties 
interest income on collected but not yet remitted funds held for clients is recognized in revenues as earned  as the collection  holding  and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 
we also recognize revenues associated with the sale of software systems and associated software licenses eg  dealer services dealer management systems 
for a majority of our software sales arrangements  which provide hardware  software licenses  installation  and post contract customer support  revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term  as vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of the individual elements in the sales arrangement does not exist 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
we assess collectability of our revenues based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer payment history 
we do not believe that a change in our assumptions utilized in the collectability determination would result in a material change to revenues as no single customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues 
goodwill 
we account for goodwill in accordance with asc  which states that goodwill should not be amortized  but instead tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we perform this impairment test by first comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the carrying value for a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we then compare the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount in order to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an equal weighted blended approach  which combines the income approach  which is the present value of expected cash flows  discounted at a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital  and the market approach  which is based on using market multiples of companies in similar lines of business 
significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue growth rates  profitability projections  working capital assumptions  the weighted average cost of capital  the determination of appropriate market comparison companies  and terminal growth rates 
we had  million of goodwill as of june  based on the fair value analysis completed in the fourth quarter of  management concluded that fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units  with the exception of the adp advancedmd reporting unit  for which an impairment charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal in completing the annual impairment test for fiscal  we evaluated the reasonableness of differences noted between the fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit 
given the significance of our goodwill  an adverse change to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our consolidated earnings if we are unable to generate the anticipated revenue growth  synergies and or cost savings associated with our acquisitions 
income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns eg  realization of deferred tax assets  changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities 
a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
there is a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
specifically  the likelihood of an entity tax benefits being sustained must be more likely than not assuming that those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements 
if a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard  the benefit can no longer be recognized 
assumptions  judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes 
a change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
as of june  and  the company liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  which include interest and penalties  were million and million  respectively 
if certain pending tax matters settle within the next twelve months  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease for all open tax years and jurisdictions 
based on current estimates  settlements related to various jurisdictions and tax periods could increase earnings up to million in the next twelve months 
audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
stock based compensation 
we measure stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
we determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option pricing model 
the binomial option pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility  dividend yield  risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior 
expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities  historical volatility of our stock price and other factors 
similarly  the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes 
the risk free rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the binomial option pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data 
the expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
determining these assumptions is subjective and complex  and therefore  a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options
