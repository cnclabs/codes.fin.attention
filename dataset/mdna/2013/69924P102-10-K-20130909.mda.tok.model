item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we are an exploratory stage mining company that currently has mining concessions in mexico and mineral claims in nevada  usa 
we have no proven reserves at our san miguel project in mexico or at our sleeper gold project in nevada but are currently exploring both projects 
the following discussion updates our plan of operations for the foreseeable future 
it also analyzes our financial condition and summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended june    and and compares each year s results to the results of the prior year 
plan of operation exploration at our san miguel project we continue to conduct exploration drilling by testing new areas or expanding on known mineralized zones with infill drilling 
the plan is to maintain one core drill rig throughout the year 
over fifty drill holes have been completed since our last material estimate 
the company plans to update this estimate in the second half of the company also intends to evaluate silver metallurgical recovery alternatives for the don ese zone 
the company s exploration plan and budget for the san miguel project will be managed by its in house technical staff 
it will be funded by the company s cash on hand  and we have budgeted approximately million for the next twelve months 
our plan for the next twelve months is to continue focusing on our sleeper gold project 
our budget for this period is approximately million 
the budget activities will include drilling  modeling and metallurgical testing 
the drill plans include drilling to obtain metallurgical samples  infill drilling to increase confidence in mineralized material and exploration drilling in the south sleeper zone 
we plan to update our mineralized material model with drill hole data that was not included 
this will allow us  along with a newly created geo metallurgical model  to update our preliminary economic assessment the pea which we completed in our work at both the san miguel project and sleeper gold project is consistent with paramount s strategy of expanding and upgrading known  large scale precious metal occurrences in established mining camps  defining their economic potential and then partnering them with nearby producers 
comparison of operating results for the year ended june  as compared to june  liquidity and capital resources at june   we had a cash and short term investment balance of  compared to  as at june  the cash used to fund our exploration programs and corporate overhead was partially offset by the warrant exercise completed by fcmi in march at june   we had a net working capital in the amount of  we anticipate our cash expenditures to fund exploration programs and general corporate expenses to be approximately  per month for the next twelve months 
anticipated cash outlays will be funded by our available cash reserves and future issuances of shares of our common stock

we continue to assess our needs for additional capital to ensure sufficient financial resources are available to fund our exploration and working capital needs 
we believe that our access to additional capital together with our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our needs for the next twelve months 
if  however  we are unable to obtain additional capital or financing  our exploration and development activities will be significantly adversely affected

for the year ended june   the company s warrant liability decreased by  the decrease was recorded as a gain on the consolidated statement of operations 
the decrease in warrant liability is primarily due to a decrease in the company s share price from at june  to at june  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments as of june  to make future payments under certain contracts  aggregated by category of contractual obligation  for specified time periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years accounts payable accrued liabilities asset retirement obligations total critical accounting policies management considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies are those related to mineral property acquisition costs  exploration and development cost  stock based compensation  derivative accounting and foreign currency translation 

table of contents estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements and notes in conformity to united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and long lived assets 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
mineral property acquisition costs the company capitalizes the cost of acquiring mineral properties and will amortize these costs over the useful life of a property following the commencement of production or expense these costs if it is determined that the mineral property has no future economic value or the properties are sold or abandoned 
costs include cash consideration and the fair market value of shares issued on the acquisition of mineral properties 
properties acquired under option agreements  whereby payments are made at the sole discretion of the company  are recorded in the accounts of the specific mineral property at the time the payments are made 
the amounts recorded as mineral properties reflect actual costs incurred to acquire the properties and do not indicate any present or future value of economically recoverable reserves 
exploration expenses the company records exploration expenses as incurred 
when it is determined that precious metal resource deposit can be economically and legally extracted or produced based on established proven and probable reserves  further exploration expenses related to such reserves incurred after such a determination will be capitalized 
to date the company has not established any proven or probable reserves and will continue to expense exploration expenses as incurred 
derivatives the company has adopted the amended provisions of asc on determining what types of instruments or embedded features in an instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock 
the company has issued stock purchase warrants with exercise prices denominated in a currency other than its functional currency of us dollars 
as a result  these warrants are no longer considered indexed to our stock and must be accounted for as a derivative instrument 
warrants that are issued with exercise prices other than the company s functional currency of the us dollar are accounted for as liabilities 
the fair value of the company s outstanding warrant liabilities is determined at each reporting date with any change to the liability from a previous period recorded in the statement of operations 
we record changes in the fair value of our warrant liabilities as a component of other income and expense as we believe the amounts recorded relate to financing activities and not as a result of our operations 
if a stock purchase warrant is exercised the company is only obligated to issue shares in its common stock 
if the company were to issue stock purchase warrants with exercise prices in its functional currency  the warrants would be considered indexed to our stock and the fair value at date of issue recorded as equity 
there would be no requirement under us gaap to report changes in its fair value from period to period 
foreign currency translation the functional currency of the company is the us dollar 
transactions involving foreign currencies for items included in operations are translated into us dollars using the monthly average exchange rate and monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the consolidated balance sheet date and all other consolidated balance sheet items are translated at historical rates applicable to the transactions that comprise the amounts 
translation gains and losses are included in the determination of other comprehensive loss and gains in the statement of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk the company holds cash balances in both us and canadian dollars 
we transact most of our business in us and canadian dollars 
some of our expenses  including labor and operating supplies are denominated in mexican pesos 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact our operating costs 
we do not manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of financial or derivative instruments  forward contracts or hedging activities 
in general  the strengthening of the us dollar or canadian dollar will positively impact our expenses transacted in mexican pesos 
conversely  any weakening of the u 
s dollar or canadian dollar will increase our expenses transacted in mexican pesos 
we do not believe that any weakening of the us or canadian dollar as compared to the mexican peso will have an adverse material effect on our operations 
interest rate risk the company s investment policy for its cash and cash equivalents is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the company 
the company s interest earned on its cash balances is impacted on the fluctuations of us and canadian interest rates 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we do not believe that interest rate fluctuations will have any effect on our operations
