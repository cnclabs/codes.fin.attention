recent developments the company conducted an evaluation of its technology products multi brand united states consumer strategy and the intangible assets used in that strategy and concluded that the company s future north american consumer business would be optimized by consolidating its united states consumer operations under tigerdirect  its leading and largest brand 
this brand consolidation was effected in the fourth quarter of resulting in a write off of the intangible assets and goodwill of compusa and circuit city of approximately million 
the company exited the pc manufacturing business during the fourth quarter of after conducting an evaluation of its operations and concluded that the company s north american technology results will be enhanced by exiting the computer manufacturing business

the company is opening a shared services center in budapest  hungary in to facilitate the continued growth of its european technology business 
this new facility will provide certain administrative and back office services for the existing european business and will help drive operational efficiencies and better serve the company s pan european operating strategy and will serve as the sales location for future business in eastern europe

see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional financial information about our business s as well as information about our geographic operations 
the company was incorporated in delaware in certain predecessor businesses which now constitute part of the company have been in business since our headquarters office is located at harbor park drive  port washington  new york 
products we offer hundreds of thousands of brand name and private label products 
we endeavor to expand and keep current the breadth of our product offerings in order to fulfill the increasingly wide range of product needs of our customers 
products offered by our technology products segment include individual technology products in the following categories computers  computer parts  tablets  tv and video  audio  cameras and surveillance  car and gps  cell phones  software  video games and toys  home and electronics accessories 

table of contents products offered by our industrial products segment include individual industrial products in the following categories material handling  storage and shelving  workbench and shop desks  packaging and supplies  furniture and office  foodservice and appliances  janitorial and maintenance  tools and instruments  fasteners and hardware  motors and power transmission  hvac r and fans  electrical and bulbs  plumbing supplies  and safety and medical items 
sales and marketing we market our products to both individual consumers and business customers 
our business customers include for profit businesses  educational organizations and government entities 
we have developed numerous proprietary customer and prospect databases 
to reach our individual consumer customers  we use online methods such as website campaigns  banner ads and e mail campaigns 
we are able to monitor and evaluate the results of our various advertising campaigns to enable us to execute them in the most cost effective manner 
we combine our use of e commerce initiatives with catalog mailings  which generate online orders and calls to inbound sales representatives 
these sales representatives use our information and distribution systems to fulfill orders and explore additional customer product needs 
sales to individual consumers are generally fulfilled from our own stock  requiring us to carry more inventory than we would for our business customers 
we also periodically take advantage of attractive product pricing by making opportunistic bulk inventory purchases with the objective of turning them quickly into sales 
we have also successfully increased our sales to individual consumers by using retail outlet stores 
we have established a multi faceted direct marketing system to business customers  consisting primarily of our relationship marketers  catalog mailings and proprietary internet websites  the combination of which is designed to maximize sales 
our relationship marketers focus their efforts on our business customers by establishing a personal relationship between such customers and a systemax account manager 
the goal of the relationship marketing sales force is to increase the purchasing productivity of current customers and to actively solicit newly targeted prospects to become customers 
with access to the records we maintain  our relationship marketers are prompted with product suggestions to expand customer order values 
in certain countries  we also have the ability to provide such customers with electronic data interchange edi ordering and customized billing services  customer savings reports and stocking of specialty items specifically requested by these customers 
our relationship marketers efforts are supported by frequent catalog mailings and e mail campaigns  both of which are designed to generate inbound telephone sales  and our interactive websites  which allow customers to purchase products directly over the internet 
we believe that the integration of our multiple marketing methods enables us to more thoroughly penetrate our business  educational and government customer base 
we believe increased internet exposure leads to more internet related sales and also generates more inbound telephone sales  just as we believe catalog mailings and email campaigns which feature our websites results in greater internet related sales 
e commerce the worldwide growth in active internet users has made e commerce a significant opportunity for sales growth 
the increase in our internet related sales enables us to leverage our advertising spending 
we currently operate multiple e commerce sites  including north america europe www

com we are continually upgrading the capabilities and performance of these websites 
our internet sites feature on line catalogs of hundreds of thousands of products  allowing us to offer a wider variety of computer and industrial products than our printed catalogs 
our customers have around the clock  on line access to purchase products and we have the ability to create targeted promotions for our customers interests 

table of contents in addition to our own e commerce websites  we have partnering agreements with several of the largest internet shopping and search engine providers who feature our products on their websites or provide click throughs from their sites directly to ours 
these arrangements allow us to expand our customer base at an economical cost 
catalogs we currently produce a total of full line or direct mail publications in north america and europe under distinct titles 
our portfolio of catalogs includes such established brand names as tigerdirect 
com  global computer supplies  tigerdirect 
ca  misco  global industrial  nexel and inmac wstore 
we mail catalogs to both businesses and individual consumers 
in the case of business mailings  we mail our catalogs to many individuals at a single business location  providing us with multiple points of contact 
our in house staff designs all of our catalogs  which reduces overall catalog expense and shortens catalog production time 
our catalogs are printed by third parties under fixed pricing arrangements 
the commonality of certain core pages of our catalogs also allows for economies of scale in catalog production 
continuing our focus on internet advertising  the distribution of our catalogs decreased to million in  which was less than in the prior year 
in  we mailed approximately million catalogs in north america  a decrease from last year and approximately million catalogs in europe  or fewer than mailed in customer service  order fulfillment and support we receive orders through the internet  by telephone  electronic data interchange and by fax 
we generally provide toll free telephone number access for our customers in countries where it is customary 
certain domestic call centers are linked to provide telephone backup in the event of a disruption in phone service 
certain of our products are carried in stock  and orders for such products are fulfilled on a timely basis directly from our distribution centers  typically within one day of the order 
we utilize numerous sales and distribution facilities in north america and europe 
orders are generally shipped by third party delivery services 
we maintain relationships with a number of large distributors in north america and europe that also deliver products directly to our customers 
we provide extensive technical telephone support to our private label pc customers 
we maintain a database of commonly asked questions for our technical support representatives  enabling them to respond quickly to similar questions 
we conduct regular on site training seminars for our sales representatives to help ensure that they are well trained and informed regarding our latest product offerings 
suppliers we purchase substantially all of our products and components directly from manufacturers and large wholesale distributors 
in  no vendor accounted for of more of our purchases 
one vendor accounted for and of our purchases in and  respectively 
the loss of these vendors  or any other key vendors  could have a material adverse effect on us 
most private label products are manufactured by third parties to our specifications 
competition and other market factors technology products the north american and european technology product markets are highly competitive  with many us  asian and european companies vying for market share 
there are few barriers to entry  with these products being sold through multiple channels of distribution  including direct marketers  local and national retail computer stores  computer resellers  mass merchants  over the internet and by computer and office supply superstores 
timely introduction of new products or product features are critical elements to remaining competitive 
other competitive factors include product performance  quality and reliability  technical support and customer service  marketing and distribution and price 
some of our competitors have stronger brand recognition  broader product lines and greater financial  marketing  manufacturing and technological resources than us 
conditions in the market for technology products remain highly competitive  resulting in our frequent discounting of product sales price as well as offering free or highly discounted freight 
these actions have and may continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits 
additionally  we rely in part upon the introduction of new technologies and products by other manufacturers in order to sustain long term sales growth and profitability 
there is no assurance that the rapid rate of such technological advances and product development will continue 

table of contents current economic conditions in the united states  including eroding consumer demand  as well as ongoing difficulties in the various european countries where we operate  raise additional concerns as we believe the loss of consumer confidence in the company s markets together with the effects of the fiscal cliff and budget discussions in the us has resulted in a decrease of spending in the categories of products we sell 
it is also possible that as manufacturers react to the marketplace they may reduce manufacturing capacity and create shortages of product 
industrial products the market for the sale of industrial products in north america is highly fragmented and is characterized by multiple distribution channels such as small dealerships  direct mail distribution  internet based resellers  large warehouse stores and retail outlets 
we also face competition from manufacturers own sales representatives  who sell industrial equipment directly to customers  and from regional or local distributors 
many high volume purchasers  however  utilize catalog distributors as their first source of product 
in the industrial products market  customer purchasing decisions are primarily based on price  product selection  product availability  level of service and convenience 
we believe that direct marketing via sales representatives  catalog and the internet are effective and convenient distribution methods to reach mid sized facilities that place many small orders and require a wide selection of products 
in addition  because the industrial products market is highly fragmented and generally less brand oriented  it is well suited to private label products 
employees as of december   we employed a total of approximately  employees  of whom  were in north america and  were in europe and asia 
seasonality as the company has a significant portion of its sales in the north america consumer business market  the fourth quarter has represented the greatest portion of annual sales 
net sales have historically been modestly weaker during the second and third quarters as a result of lower business activity during those months 
see item  management s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  seasonality 
environmental matters under various national  state and local environmental laws and regulations in north america and western europe  a current or previous owner or operator including the lessee of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at such real property 
such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault 
we lease most of our facilities 
in connection with such leases  we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remedial actions with respect to hazardous substances 
although we have not been notified of  and are not otherwise aware of  any material real property environmental liability  claim or non compliance  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur remediation or other costs in connection with real property environmental matters in the future 
financial information about foreign and domestic operations we currently sell our products in north america the united states  puerto rico and canada and europe 
approximately   and of our net sales during  and  respectively were made by subsidiaries located outside of the united states

item a 
risk factors 
there are a number of factors and variables described below that may affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
other factors of which we are currently not aware or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our results of operations and financial position 
risks related to the economy and our industries general economic conditions  such as decreased consumer confidence and spending  reductions in manufacturing capacity  and inflation could result in our failure to achieve our historical sales growth rates and profit levels 
current economic conditions may cause the loss of consumer confidence in the company s domestic and international markets which may result in a decrease of spending in the categories of products we sell  as occurred in with conditions in the market for technology products remaining highly competitive  reductions in our selling prices  as we have experienced in recent years  have adversely affected our revenues and profits and could continue to do so in the future 
it is also possible that as manufacturers react to the marketplace they may reduce manufacturing capacity or allocations to their customers creating shortages of product 
both we and our customers are subject to global political  economic and market conditions  including inflation  interest rates  energy costs  the impact of natural disasters  military action and the threat of terrorism 
our consolidated results of operations are directly affected by economic conditions in north america and europe 
we may experience a decline in sales as a result of poor economic conditions and the lack of visibility relating to future orders  as occurred in our results of operations depend upon  among other things  our ability to maintain and increase sales volumes with existing customers  our ability to limit price reductions and maintain our margins  our ability to attract new customers and the financial condition of our customers 
a decline in the economy that adversely affects our customers  causing them to limit or defer their spending  would likely adversely affect our sales  prices and profitability as well  as occurred in we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be able to maintain or improve upon historical sales volumes with existing customers  or whether we will be able to attract new customers 
in response to economic and market conditions  from time to time we have undertaken initiatives to reduce our cost structure where appropriate 
these initiatives  as well as any future workforce and facilities reductions  may not be sufficient to meet current and future changes in economic and market conditions and allow us to continue to achieve the growth rates and re attain the levels of profitability we experienced prior to the recent market downturns 
in addition  costs actually incurred in connection with our restructuring actions  including launching and integrating the new shared services facility in hungary  may be higher than our estimates of such costs and or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings 

table of contents the markets for our products and services are extremely competitive and if we are unable to successfully respond to our competitors strategies our sales and gross margins will be adversely affected 
we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and subject to constant technological change 
we expect this competition to further intensify in the future 
competitive factors include price  availability  service and support 
we compete with a wide variety of other resellers and retailers  including internet marketers  as well as manufacturers 
many of our competitors are larger companies with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
the market for the sale of industrial products in north america is highly fragmented and is characterized by multiple distribution channels such as small dealerships  direct mail distribution  internet based resellers  large warehouse stores and retail outlets 
we also face competition from manufacturers own sales representatives  who sell industrial equipment directly to customers  and from regional or local distributors 
in addition  new competitors may enter our markets 
this may place us at a disadvantage in responding to competitors pricing strategies  technological advances and other initiatives  resulting in our inability to increase our revenues or maintain our gross margins in the future 
in most cases our products compete directly with those offered by other manufacturers and distributors 
if any of our competitors were to develop products or services that are more cost effective or technically superior  demand for our product offerings could decrease 
our gross margins are also dependent on the mix of products we sell and could be adversely affected by a continuation of our customers shift to lower priced products 
sales tax laws may be changed or interpreted differently which could result in ecommerce and direct mail retailers having to collect sales taxes in states where the current laws do not require us to do so 
this could reduce demand for our products in such states and could result in us having substantial tax liabilities for past sales 
our united states subsidiaries collect and remit sales tax in states in which the subsidiaries have physical presence or in which we believe sufficient nexus exists which obligates us to collect sales tax 
other states may  from time to time  claim that we have state related activities constituting physical nexus to require such collection 
additionally  many other states seek to impose sales tax collection or reporting obligations on companies that sell goods to customers in their state  or directly to the state and its political subdivisions  regardless of physical presence 
such efforts by states have increased recently  as states seek to raise revenues without increasing the income tax burden on residents 
we rely on united states supreme court decisions which hold that  without congressional authority  a state may not enforce a sales tax collection obligation on a company that has no physical presence in the state and whose only contacts with the state are through the use of interstate commerce such as the mailing of catalogs into the state and the delivery of goods by mail or common carrier 
we cannot predict whether the nature or level of contacts we have with a particular state will be deemed enough to require us to collect sales tax in that state nor can we be assured that congress or individual states will not approve legislation authorizing states to impose tax collection or reporting obligations on all e commerce and or direct mail transactions 
a successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales tax on the sale of merchandise could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past sales would result in considerable administrative burdens and costs for us and may reduce demand for our products from customers in such states when we charge customers for such taxes 
events such as acts of war or terrorism  natural disasters  changes in law  or large losses could adversely affect our insurance coverage and insurance expense  resulting in an adverse affect on our profitability and financial condition 
we insure for certain property and casualty risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property  business interruptions resulting from property losses  worker s compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
although we believe that our insurance coverage is reasonable  significant events such as acts of war and terrorism  economic conditions  judicial decisions  legislation  natural disasters and large losses could materially affect our insurance obligations and future expense 

table of contents risks related to our company we rely to a great extent on our information and telecommunications systems  and significant system failures or outages  or our failure to properly evaluate  upgrade or replace our systems  or the failure of our security safety measures to protect our systems and websites  could have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
we rely on a variety of information and telecommunications systems in our operations 
our success is dependent in large part on the accuracy and proper use of our information systems  including our telecommunications systems 
to manage our growth  we continually evaluate the adequacy of our existing systems and procedures 
we anticipate that we will regularly need to make capital expenditures to upgrade and modify our management information systems  including software and hardware  as we grow and the needs of our business change 
the occurrence of a significant system failure  electrical or telecommunications outages or our failure to expand or successfully implement new systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our information systems networks  including our websites  and applications could be adversely affected by viruses or worms and may be vulnerable to malicious acts such as hacking 
the availability and efficiency of sales via our websites could also be adversely affected by denial of service attacks and other unfair competitive practices 
although we take preventive measures  these procedures may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our operations  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
the establishment and integration of our new shared service center in hungary exposes us to various technology  regulatory and economic risks 
we have announced that we will be launching our new shared services center in budapest  hungary during the second quarter of the new facility will provide certain administrative and back office services to our european business and will help drive operational efficiencies and better serve the company pan european operating strategy 
our efforts to operate our european business in a more centralized manner  rather than on an individual country by country basis  will require us to implement changes in our business processes  eliminate redundancies  relocate and or hire new personnel  transition our information management systems  and integrate the new operation into our existing business seamlessly and without disruption to our operations  customers and vendors 
however  changes in economic  regulatory or political conditions in hungary  delays in launching or integrating the facility  a lower than expected impact of the facility on the company s european operations  costs and capital expenditures  the ability to timely hire and train new employees in hungary  and delays  impediments or other problems associated with its establishment  could all have a material adverse effect on our european operations and our results of operations 
we rely on third party suppliers for most of our products and services 
the loss or interruption of these relationships could impact our sales volumes  the levels of inventory we must carry  and or result in sales delays and or higher inventory costs from new suppliers 
co operative advertising and other sales incentives provided by our suppliers could decrease in the future thereby increasing our expenses and adversely affecting our results of operations and cash flows 
we purchase substantially all of our technology products from major distributors and directly from large manufacturers who may deliver those products directly to our customers 
these relationships enable us to make available to our customers a wide selection of products without having to maintain large amounts of inventory 
the termination or interruption of our relationships with any of these suppliers could materially adversely affect our business 
we purchase a number of our products from vendors outside of the united states 
difficulties encountered by one or several of these suppliers could halt or disrupt production and delay completion or cause the cancellation of our orders 
delays or interruptions in the transportation network could result in loss or delay of timely receipt of product required to fulfill customer orders 
our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge  especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us political or financial instability  merchandise quality issues  product safety concerns  trade restrictions  work stoppages  tariffs  foreign currency exchange rates  transportation capacity and costs  inflation  civil unrest  outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control 
these and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our revenue and gross profit 
many product suppliers provide us with co operative advertising support in exchange for featuring their products in our catalogs and on our internet sites 
certain suppliers provide us with other incentives such as rebates  reimbursements  payment discounts  price protection and other similar arrangements 
these incentives are offset against cost of goods sold or selling  general and administrative expenses  as applicable 
the level of co operative advertising support and other incentives received from suppliers may decline in the future  which could increase our cost of goods sold or selling  general and administrative expenses and have an adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired resulting in a charge to earnings 
the acquisition of certain assets of compusa  circuit city and the purchase of the stock of wstore europe sa resulted in the recording of significant intangible assets and or goodwill 
we are required to test goodwill and intangible assets annually to determine if the carrying values of these assets are impaired or on a more frequent basis if indicators of impairment exist 
if any of our goodwill or intangible assets are determined to be impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the period during which the impairment is discovered 
in the fourth quarter of  the company did record one time  non cash impairment charges of approximately million related to the intangible assets and goodwill of compusa and circuit city 
our substantial international operations are subject to risks such as fluctuations in currency rates which can adversely impact foreign revenues and profits when translated to us dollars  foreign regulatory requirements  political uncertainty and the management of our growing international operations 
we operate internationally and as a result  we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally  such as risks related to the differing legal  political and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 
risks inherent to operating internationally include changes in a country s economic or political conditions changes in foreign currency exchange rates difficulties with staffing and managing international operations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements changes in transportation and shipping costs enforcement of intellectual property rights we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets  liabilities  net sales  cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange gains or losses 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the european union euro  canadian dollar  british pound sterling  and the us dollar 
exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 
for example  we currently have operations located in numerous countries outside the united states  and non us sales europe and canada accounted for approximately of our revenue during to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced when translated into us dollars 
we are exposed to various inventory risks  such as being unable to profitably resell excess or obsolete inventory and or the loss of product return rights and price protection from our vendors  such events could lower our gross margins or result in inventory write downs that would reduce reported future earnings 
our inventory is subject to risk due to technological change and changes in market demand for particular products 
if we fail to manage our inventory of older products we may have excess or obsolete inventory 
we may have limited rights to return purchases to certain suppliers and we may not be able to obtain price protection on these items 
the elimination of purchase return privileges and lack of availability of price protection could lower our gross margin or result in inventory write downs 
we also take advantage of attractive product pricing by making opportunistic bulk inventory purchases  any resulting excess and or obsolete inventory that we are not able to re sell could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
any inability to make such bulk inventory purchases may significantly impact our sales and profitability 

table of contents we depend on bank credit facilities to address our working capital and cash flow needs from time to time  and if we are unable to renew or replace these facilities  or borrowing capacity were to be reduced our liquidity and capital resources may be adversely affected 
we require significant levels of capital in our business to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we maintain credit facilities in the united states to finance increases in our working capital if available cash is insufficient 
the amount of credit available to us at any point in time may be adversely affected by the quality or value of the assets collateralizing these credit lines 
in addition  in recent years global financial markets have experienced diminished liquidity and lending constraints 
our ability to obtain future and or increased financing to satisfy our requirements as our business expands could be adversely affected by economic and market conditions  credit availability and lender perception of our company and industry 
however  we currently have no reason to believe that we will not be able to renew or replace our facilities when they reach maturity 
if we fail to observe certain restrictions and covenants under our credit facilities the lenders could refuse to waive such default  terminate the credit facility and demand immediate repayment  which would adversely affect our cash position and materially adversely affect our operations 
our united states revolving credit agreement contains covenants restricting or limiting our ability to  among other things incur additional debt create or permit liens on assets make capital expenditures or investments pay dividends if we fail to comply with the covenants and other requirements set forth in the credit agreement  we would be in default and would need to negotiate a waiver agreement with the lenders 
failure to agree on such a waiver could result in the lenders terminating the credit agreement and demanding repayment of any outstanding borrowings  which could adversely affect our cash position and adversely affect the availability of financing to us  which could materially impact our operations 
our european employees are represented by unions or workers councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the us as of december   we had approximately  employees   of which are located in europe and asia 
we have workers councils representing the employees of our france  germany  and netherlands operations  and trade unions representing our employees in italy and sweden and elected employee representatives for our employees in the united kingdom and spain 
most of these european employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements 
for example  most of our employees in europe are represented by unions or workers councils that must approve certain changes in conditions of employment  including salaries and benefits and staff changes  and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce 
the establishment of our shared services center in hungary regarding related reductions in force is subject to discussion with and approval of certain of the workers councils 
we believe that we have a generally good relationship with these councils and unions 
we have entered into consultation processes under local laws at our germany  france  netherlands and italy locations for  among other things  restructuring our operations and effecting reductions in force in connection with implementing our shared services center in hungary 
although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees  a strike  work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 
we operate retail stores in north america and we must effectively manage our cost structure  such as inventory needs  point of sales systems  personnel and lease expense 
we currently have retail stores operating in north america at december  the company needs to effectively manage its cost structure including the additional inventory needs  retail point of sales it systems  retail personnel and leased facilities 
future growth in retail will also be dependent on the ability to attract customers and build brand loyalty 
the retail computer and consumer electronics business is highly competitive and has narrow gross margins 
if we fail to manage our growth and cost structure while maintaining high levels of service and meeting competitive pressures adequately  our business plan may not be achieved and may lead to reduced profitability 

table of contents the failure to timely and satisfactorily process manufacturers and our own rebate programs could negatively impact our customer satisfaction levels 
similar to other companies in the technology products industry  we advertise manufacturers mail in rebates on many products we sell and  in some cases  offer our own rebates 
these rebates are processed through third party vendors and in house 
if these rebates are not processed in a timely and satisfactory manner by either third party vendors or our in house operations  our reputation in the marketplace could be negatively impacted 
we may be unable to reduce prices in reaction to competitive pressures  or implement cost reductions or new product line expansion to address gross profit and operating margin pressures  failure to mitigate these pressures could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
the computer and consumer electronics industry is highly price competitive and gross profit margins are narrow and variable 
the company s ability to further reduce prices in reaction to competitive pressure is limited 
additionally  gross margins and operating margins are affected by changes in factors such as vendor pricing  vendor rebate and or price protection programs  product return rights  and product mix 
in pricing pressure continued to be prevalent in the markets we serve and we expect this to continue 
we may not be able to mitigate these pricing pressures and resultant declines in sales and gross profit margin with cost reductions in other areas or expansion into new product lines 
if we are unable to proportionately mitigate these conditions our operating results and financial condition may suffer 
we would be exposed to liability  including substantial fines and penalties and  in extreme cases  loss of our ability to accept credit cards  in the event our privacy and data security policies and procedures are inadequate to prevent security breaches of our consumer personal information and credit card information records 
in processing our sales orders we often collect personal information and credit card information from our customers 
the company has privacy and data security policies in place which are designed to prevent security breaches  however  if a third party or a rogue employee or employees are able to bypass our network security  hack into our systems or otherwise compromise our customers personal information or credit card information  we could be subject to liability 
this liability may include claims for identity theft  unauthorized purchases and claims alleging misrepresentation of our privacy and data security practices or other related claims 
while the company believes it conforms to appropriate payment card industry pci security standards for its various businesses  any breach involving the loss of credit card information may lead to pci related fines in the millions of dollars 
in the event of a severe breach  credit card providers may prevent our accepting of credit cards 
any such liability related to the aforementioned risks could lead to reduced profitability and damage our brand s and or reputation 
failure to protect the integrity  security and use of our customers information could expose us to litigation and materially damage our standing with our customers 
the use of individually identifiable consumer data is regulated at the state  federal and international levels and we incur costs associated with information security such as increased investment in technology and the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws 
additionally  our internet operations and website sales depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks  including the use of cashless payments 
while we have taken significant steps to protect customer and confidential information  there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  the efforts of hackers and cyber criminals or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and our customers personal data 
if any such compromise of our security were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  operating results and financial condition and could subject us to litigation 
sales to individual customers expose us to credit card fraud  which impacts our operations 
if we fail to adequately protect ourselves from credit card fraud  our operations could be adversely impacted 
failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions could increase our expenses 
increased sales to individual consumers  which are more likely to be paid for using a credit card  increases our exposure to fraud 
we employ technology solutions to help us detect the fraudulent use of credit card information 
however  if we are unable to detect or control credit card fraud  we may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data  which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents our business is dependent on certain key personnel

our profitability can be adversely affected by changes in our income tax exposure due to changes in tax rates or laws  changes in our effective tax rate due to changes in the mix of earnings among different countries  restrictions on utilization of tax benefits and changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
changes in our income tax expense due to changes in the mix of us and non us revenues and profitability  changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  restrictions on utilization of tax benefits  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws or by material audit assessments 
the carrying value of our deferred tax assets  which are primarily in the united states and the united kingdom  is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in those jurisdictions 
in addition  the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit in our various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability 
changes in accounting standards or practices  as well as new accounting pronouncements or interpretations  may require us to account for and report our financial results in a different manner in the future  which may be less favorable than the manner used historically 
a change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of existing accounting rules and practices have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules may adversely affect our reported financial results 
concentration of ownership and control limits stockholders ability to influence corporate actions richard leeds  robert leeds  and bruce leeds each a director and executive officer of the company  together with trusts for the benefit of certain members of their respective families and other entities controlled by them  control in excess of of the voting power of our outstanding common stock 
due to such holdings  the leeds brothers together with these trusts and entities are able to determine the outcome of virtually all matters submitted to stockholders for approval  including the election of directors  the appointment of management  amendment of our articles of incorporation  significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets  the payments of dividends on our common stock and the entering into of extraordinary transactions 
further  as a controlled company under nyse rules  the company has elected to opt out of certain new york stock exchange listing standards that  among other things  require listed companies to have a majority of independent directors on their board  the company does however currently have an independent audit  compensation committee and corporate governance and nominating committees 
risk of thin trading and volatility of our common stock could impact stockholder value our common stock is currently listed on the nyse and is thinly traded 
volatility of thinly traded stocks is typically higher than the volatility of more liquid stocks with higher trading volumes 
the trading of relatively small quantities of shares of common stock by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction 
this may result in volatility in our stock price and could exacerbate the other volatility inducing factors described below 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of being thinly traded

overview systemax is primarily a direct marketer of brand name and private label products 
our operations are organized in two reportable business segments technology products and industrial products 
our technology products segment sells computers  computer supplies and consumer electronics which are marketed in north america  puerto rico and europe 
most of these products are manufactured by other companies  however  we do offer a selection of products that are manufactured for us to our own design and marketed on a private label basis 
technology products accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
the company conducted an evaluation of its technology products multi brand united states consumer strategy and the intangible assets used in that strategy and concluded that the company s future north american consumer business would be optimized by consolidating its united states consumer operations under tigerdirect  its leading and largest brand 
this consolidation was effected in the fourth quarter of resulting in a write off of the intangible assets and goodwill of compusa and circuit city of approximately million 
the company exited the pc manufacturing operations during the fourth quarter of after conducting an evaluation of its operations and concluded that the company s north american technology results will be enhanced by exiting the computer manufacturing business 
the exit resulted in a fourth quarter of asset write down of the carrying cost of the company s computer manufacturing facilities  related equipment and inventory of approximately million 
the company is opening a shared services center in budapest  hungary in to facilitate the continued growth of its european technology products business 
this new facility will provide certain administrative and back office services for the existing european business  will help drive operational efficiencies and better serve the company s pan european operating strategy  and will serve as the sales location for future business in eastern europe 
exit  severance and start up costs to implement the facility together with other cost reduction initiatives in europe  aggregated to million in the fourth quarter of our industrial products segment sells a wide array of industrial products and supplies which are marketed in north america 
most of these products are manufactured by other companies 
some products are manufactured for us to our own design and marketed under the trademarks global  globalindustrial 
com and nexel 
industrial products accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
in both of these product groups  we offer our customers a broad selection of products  prompt order fulfillment and extensive customer service 

table of contents we exited the software solutions segment in june one customer remained being serviced by the company until the second quarter of the termination of this customer has resulted in all current and prior period results have for this business segment to be classified as discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional financial information about our business segments as well as information about our geographic operations 
the market for computer products and consumer electronics is subject to intense price competition and is characterized by narrow gross profit margins 
the north american industrial products market is highly fragmented and we compete against multiple distribution channels 
distribution is working capital intensive  requiring us to incur significant costs associated with the warehousing of many products  including the costs of maintaining inventory  leasing warehouse space  inventory management systems  and employing personnel to perform the associated tasks 
we supplement our on hand product availability by maintaining relationships with major distributors and manufacturers  utilizing a combination of stock and drop shipment fulfillment 
the primary component of our operating expenses historically has been employee related costs  which includes items such as wages  commissions  bonuses  employee benefits and stock option expenses 
we continually assess our operations to ensure that they are efficient  aligned with market conditions and responsive to customer needs 
in the discussion of our results of operations we refer to business to business sales  consumer channel sales and period to period constant currency comparisons 
business to business sales are sales made direct to other businesses through managed business relationships  outbound call centers and extranets 
sales in the industrial products segment and corporate and other are considered to be business to business sales 
consumer channel sales are sales from retail stores  consumer websites  inbound call centers and television shopping channels 
constant currency refers to the adjustment of the results of our foreign operations to exclude the effects of period to period fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  and as a result  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  observation of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and the consolidated financial statements of the company accurately reflect management s best estimate of the consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company for the years presented 
we identify below a number of policies that entail significant judgments or estimates  the assumptions and or judgments used to determine those estimates and the potential effects on reported financial results if actual results differ materially from these estimates 
accounting policy assumptions and uncertainties quantification and analysis of effect on actual results if estimates differ materially revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales when persuasive evidence of an order arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met at the time of receipt by customers when title and risk of loss both are transferred  except in our industrial products segment where title and risk pass at time of shipment 
sales are presented net of returns and allowances  rebates and sales incentives 
reserves for estimated returns and allowances are provided when sales are recorded  based on historical experience and current trends 
our revenue recognition policy contains assumptions and judgments made by management related to the timing and amounts of future sales returns 
sales returns are estimated based upon historical experience and current known trends 
we have not made any material changes to our sales return reserve policy in the past three years and we do not anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
however if our estimates are materially different than our actual experience we could have a material gain or loss adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable 
while bad debt allowances have been within expectations and the provisions established  there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same allowance rate we have in the past 
our allowance for doubtful accounts policy contains assumptions and judgments made by management related to collectibility of aged accounts receivable and chargebacks from credit card sales 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including an analysis of the age of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write offs 
the analysis also includes the financial condition of a specific customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
in circumstances where we are aware of customer credit card charge backs or a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts applicable to amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected is recorded 
in those situations with ongoing discussions  the amount of bad debt recognized is based on the status of the discussions 
we have not made any material changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reserve policy in the past three years and we do not anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
however if our estimates are materially different than our actual experience we could have a material gain or loss adjustment 
a change of in our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve at december  would impact net income by approximately million 

table of contents accounting policy assumptions and uncertainties quantification and analysis of effect on actual results if estimates differ materially inventory valuation 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method except in europe and retail locations where an average cost is used 
excess and obsolete or unmarketable merchandise are written down based on historical experience  assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if market conditions are less favorable than projected or if technological developments result in accelerated obsolescence  additional write downs may be required 
while obsolescence and resultant markdowns have been within expectations  there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same level of markdowns we have in the past 
our inventory reserve policy contains assumptions and judgments made by management related to inventory aging  obsolescence  credits that we may obtain for returned merchandise  shrink and consumer demand 
we have not made any material changes to our inventory reserve policy in the past three years and we do not anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
however if our estimates are materially different than our actual experience we could have a material loss adjustment 
a change of in our inventory reserves at december  would impact net income by approximately million 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we apply the provisions of relevant accounting guidance in our valuation of goodwill  trademarks  domain names  client lists and other intangible assets 
relevant accounting guidance requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles be reviewed at least annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
the amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
our impairment testing involves judgments and uncertainties  quantitative and qualitative  related to the use of discounted cash flow models and forecasts of future results  both of which involve significant judgment and may not be reliable 
significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the operating environment and economic conditions that exist to develop a forecast for a reporting unit 
assumptions related to the discounted cash flow models we use include the inputs used to determine the company s weighted average cost of capital including a market risk premium  the beta of a reporting unit  reporting unit specific risk premiums and terminal growth values 
critical assumptions related to the forecast inputs used in our discounted cash flow models include projected sales growth  same store sales growth  gross margin percentages  new business opportunities  working capital requirements  capital expenditures and growth in selling  general and administrative expense 
we also use our company market capitalization and comparable company market data to validate our reporting unit valuations 
we have not made any material changes to our goodwill policy in the past three years and we do not anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
we recorded goodwill and intangible impairment charges in see below and have approximately million in goodwill and intangible assets at december  we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates or assumptions used to determine whether any of our remaining goodwill or intangible assets are impaired will change materially in the future 
however if the inputs used in our discounted cash flow models or our forecasts are materially different than actual experience we could incur impairment charges that are material 
the company conducted an evaluation of its technology products multi brand united states consumer strategy and the intangible assets used in that strategy and concluded that the company s future north american consumer business would be optimized by consolidating its united states consumer operations under tigerdirect  its leading and largest brand 
as a result an impairment charge of approximately million related to the trademarks  domain names and goodwill of compusa and circuit city was taken in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents accounting policy assumptions and uncertainties quantification and analysis of effect on actual results if estimates differ materially long lived assets 
management exercises judgment in evaluating our long lived assets for impairment and in their depreciation and amortization methods and lives 
we believe we will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to more than recover the investments made in property  plant and equipment 
the impairment analysis for long lived assets requires management to make judgments about useful lives and to estimate fair values of long lived assets 
it may also require us to estimate future cash flows of related assets using discounted cash flow model our estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
we have not made any material changes to our long lived assets policy in the past three years and we do not anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates and assumptions used to determine long lived asset impairment will vary materially in the future 
however if our estimates are materially different than our actual experience we could have a material gain or loss adjustment 
a change of in the carrying value of our long lived assets would impact net income by approximately million 
vendor accruals 
our contractual agreements with certain suppliers provide us with funding or allowances for costs such as price protection  markdowns and advertising as well funds or allowances for purchasing volumes 
generally  allowances received as a reimbursement of identifiable costs are recorded as an expense reduction when the cost is incurred 
sales related allowances are generally determined by our level of purchases of product and are deferred and recorded as a reduction of inventory carrying value and are ultimately included as a reduction of cost of goods when inventory is sold 
management makes assumptions and exercises judgment in estimating period end funding and allowances earned under our various agreements 
estimates are developed based on the terms of our vendor agreements and using existing expenditures for which funding is available  determining products whose market price would indicate coverage for markdown or price protection is available and estimating the level of our performance under agreements that provide funds or allowances for purchasing volumes 
estimates of funding or allowances for purchasing volume will include projections of annual purchases which are developed using current actual purchase data and historical purchase trends 
accruals in interim periods could be materially different if actual purchase volumes differ from projections 
we have not made any material changes to our vendor accrual policy in the past three years nor do we anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
if actual results are different from the projections used we could have a material gain or loss adjustment 
a change of in our vendor accruals at december  would impact net income by approximately million 

table of contents accounting policy assumptions and uncertainties quantification and analysis of effect on actual results if estimates differ materially income taxes 
we are subject to taxation from federal  state and foreign jurisdictions and the determination of our tax provision is complex and requires significant management judgment 
we conduct operations in numerous us states and foreign locations 
our effective tax rate depends upon the geographic distribution of our pre tax income or losses among locations with varying tax rates and rules 
as the geographic mix of our pre tax results among various tax jurisdictions changes  the effective tax rate may vary from period to period 
we are also subject to periodic examination from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these examinations include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we establish as needed  and periodically reevaluate  an estimated income tax reserve on our consolidated balance sheet to provide for the possibility of adverse outcomes in income tax proceedings 
while management believes that we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and whether or not a reserve is appropriate  it is possible that additional exposures exist and or that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be necessary requires management to make significant judgments concerning the ability to realize net deferred tax assets 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income there are judgments and uncertainties related to the development of forecasts of future results that may not be reliable 
significant management judgment is also necessary to evaluate the operating environment and economic conditions that exist to develop a forecast for a reporting unit 
where management has determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized  we have provided a valuation allowance 
if the realization of those deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
we have not made any material changes to our income tax policy in the past three years and we do not anticipate making any material changes to this policy in the future 
we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates or assumptions used to determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowances will change materially in the future 
however if our estimates are materially different than our actual experience we could have a material gain or loss adjustment 
in we reversed approximately million in valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of our french subsidiary as a result of the subsidiary no longer being in a cumulative loss position 
a change of in our effective tax rate at december  would impact net income by approximately million 
reorganization and other charges 
we have recorded reorganization  restructuring and other charges in the past and could in the future commence further reorganization  restructuring and other activities which result in recognition in charges to income 
the recording of reorganization  restructuring and other charges may involve assumptions and judgments about future costs and timing for amounts related to personnel terminations  stay bonuses  lease termination costs  lease sublet revenues  outplacement services  contract termination costs  asset impairments and other exit costs 
management may estimate these costs using existing contractual and other data or may rely on third party expert data 
when we incur a liability related to these actions  we estimate and record all appropriate expenses 
we do not believe it is reasonably likely that the estimates or assumptions used to determine our reorganization  restructuring and other charges will change materially in the future 
however if our estimates are materially different than our actual experience we could have a material gain or loss adjustment 
for the year ended december  the company recorded reorganization and other charges of approximately million for reorganization  restructuring and asset impairment and other charges 

table of contents recently adopted and newly issued accounting pronouncements public companies in the united states are subject to the accounting and reporting requirements of various authorities  including the financial accounting standards board fasb and the securities and exchange commission sec 
these authorities issue numerous pronouncements  most of which are not applicable to the company s current or reasonably foreseeable operating structure 
below are the new authoritative pronouncements that management believes are relevant to the company s current operations 
in july  the fasb issued an update related to annual impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets which provides companies with the option to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for their indefinite lived intangible assets that may allow them to skip the annual fair value calculation 
the qualitative assessment is similar to the screen companies can use to determine whether they must perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
companies must identify and evaluate changes in economic  industry and company specific events and circumstances that could affect the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of these assets 
this asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  in june  the fasb issued asu no

the interest expense decrease is attributable to decreasing balances owed on the recovery zone bond facility and outstanding capital lease obligations

table of contents our primary liquidity needs are to support working capital requirements in our business  including working capital for the exit from the pc manufacturing business  opening a shared services center in hungary  reorganizing our european operations  including separation costs  the new distribution and call center for our industrial products segment  funding capital expenditures  including those related to our retail stores and information technology systems  implementing new inventory and warehouse functions in europe  continued investment in upgrading and expanding our technological capabilities  repaying outstanding debt  special dividends declared by our board of directors and acquisitions 
we rely principally upon operating cash flows to meet these needs 
we believe that cash flows from operations and our availability under credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other cash requirements for the next twelve months 
we believe our current capital structure and cash resources are adequate for our internal growth initiatives 
to the extent our growth initiatives expand  including major acquisitions  we would seek to raise additional capital 
we believe that  if needed  we can access public or private funding alternatives to raise additional capital 
our working capital increase in is primarily the result of increased cash  accounts receivable  and prepaid balances offset by increased accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities balances compared to accounts receivable days outstanding were at in up from in we expect that future accounts receivable and inventory balances will fluctuate with net sales and the mix of our net sales between consumer and business customers

the company maintains a million which may be increased to million  subject to certain conditions secured revolving credit agreement with a group of financial institutions which provides for borrowings in the united states 
the credit facility has a five year term and expires in october borrowings are secured by substantially all of the company s assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and certain other assets  subject to limited exceptions 
the credit agreement contains certain operating  financial and other covenants  including limits on annual levels of capital expenditures  availability tests related to payments of dividends and stock repurchases and fixed charge coverage tests related to acquisitions 
the revolving credit agreement requires that a minimum level of availability be maintained 
if such availability is not maintained  the company will be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined 
the borrowings under the agreement are subject to borrowing base limitations of up to of eligible accounts receivable and up to of qualified inventories 
the interest rate under this facility is computed at applicable market rates based on libor or the prime rate  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin varies based on borrowing base availability 
as of december   eligible collateral under this agreement was million  total availability was million  total outstanding letters of credit were million and there were no outstanding advances 
the company was in compliance with all of the covenants under this facility as of december  
table of contents the company s wstore subsidiary maintained a revolving credit agreement with a financial institution in france which was secured by wstore accounts receivable balances

the company through a subsidiary has an outstanding bond financing with the development authority of jefferson  georgia the authority 
the bonds were issued by the authority and initially purchased by ge government finance inc  and mature on october  the proceeds from the bonds were used to finance capital equipment purchased for the company s distribution facility located in jefferson  georgia 
the purchase and installation of the equipment for the facility was completed by december  pursuant to the transaction  the company transferred to the authority  for consideration consisting of the bonds proceeds  ownership of the equipment and the authority leased the equipment to the company s subsidiary pursuant to a capital equipment lease expiring october  under the capital equipment lease the company has the right to acquire ownership of the equipment at any time for a purchase price sufficient to pay off all principal and interest on the bonds  plus

as of december   the company had million outstanding against this financing facility 
our earnings and cash flows are seasonal in nature  with the fourth quarter of the fiscal year generating higher earnings and cash flows than the other quarters 
levels of earnings and cash flows are dependent on factors such as consolidated gross margin and selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales  product mix and relative levels of domestic and foreign sales 
unusual gains or expense items  such as special gains charges and settlements  may impact earnings and are separately disclosed 
we expect that past performance may not be indicative of future performance due to the competitive nature of our technology products segment where the need to adjust prices to gain or hold market share is prevalent 
macroeconomic conditions  such as business and consumer sentiment  may affect our revenues  cash flows or financial condition 
however  we do not believe that there is a direct correlation between any specific macroeconomic indicator and our revenues  cash flows or financial condition 
we are not currently interest rate sensitive  as we have significant cash balances and minimal debt 
the expenses and capital expenditures described above will require significant levels of liquidity  which we believe can be adequately funded from our currently available cash resources 
in we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million  though at this time we are not contractually committed to incur these expenditures 
over the past several years we have engaged in opportunistic acquisitions  choosing to pay the purchase price in cash  and may do so in the future as favorable situations arise 
however  a deep and prolonged period of reduced consumer and or business to business spending could adversely impact our cash resources and force us to either forego future acquisition opportunities or to pay the purchase price in shares of our common stock  which could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share 
in addition we anticipate cash needs for implementation of the financial systems 
we believe that our cash balances  future cash flows from operations and our availability under credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds or their equivalent 
as of december   all of our investments had maturities of less than three months 
accordingly  we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases for the rental of most of our facilities and certain of our equipment which expire at various dates through we have sublease agreements for unused space we lease in the united kingdom 
in the event the sub lessee is unable to fulfill its obligations  we would be responsible for rents due under the leases 

table of contents following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal payments on our debt  minimum rental payments on our non cancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other purchase obligations as of december  in millions total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases  net of subleases purchase other obligations total contractual obligations our purchase and other obligations consist primarily of certain employment agreements and service agreements 
in addition to the contractual obligations noted above  we had million of standby letters of credit outstanding as of december we are party to certain litigation  the outcome of which we believe  based on discussions with legal counsel  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
tax contingencies are related to uncertain tax positions taken on income tax returns that may result in additional tax  interest and penalties being paid to taxing authorities 
as of december   the company had no material uncertain tax positions 
in january  the company entered into a lease for the european technology products segment s shared services center 
the facility  located in budapest  hungary  is approximately  square feet and is leased through march the following table details the contractual obligations related to this lease in millions payments due by period after shared services center operating lease off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
the company currently leases its facility in port washington  ny from addwin realty associates  an entity owned by richard leeds  bruce leeds  and robert leeds  senior executives  directors and controlling shareholders of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates principally british pounds sterling  european union euros and canadian dollars as measured against the us dollar and each other 
the translation of the financial statements of our operations located outside of the united states is impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar may positively or negatively affect income statement  balance sheet and cash flows as expressed in us dollars 
sales would have fluctuated by approximately million and pretax income would have fluctuated by approximately million if average foreign exchange rates changed by in we have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we may enter into foreign currency options or forward exchange contracts aimed at limiting in part the impact of certain currency fluctuations  but as of december  we had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 

table of contents our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt 
our variable rate debt consists of short term borrowings under our credit facilities 
as of december   there were no outstanding balances under our variable rate credit facility 
a hypothetical change in average interest rates of one percentage point is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows over the next fiscal year
