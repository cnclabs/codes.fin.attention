item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k for further discussion regarding financial information by segment and geographic location 
seasonality our operations are impacted by seasonal factors 
historically  our business has been negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather  fewer daylight hours  and holidays 
our well servicing rigs are mobile and we operate a significant number of oilfield vehicles 
during periods of heavy snow  ice or rain  we may not be able to move our equipment between locations  thereby reducing our ability to generate rig or truck hours 
in addition  the majority of our well servicing rigs work only during daylight hours 
in the winter months as daylight time becomes shorter  the amount of time that the well servicing rigs work is shortened  which has a negative impact on total hours worked 
finally  we historically have experienced significant slowdown during the thanksgiving and christmas holiday seasons 
sales and marketing sales and marketing functions are performed at two levels at the field level through our operations personnel and through our sales representatives and executives at the corporate level 
at the field level  our operations and rig supervisors are in constant contact with their counterparts who represent our customers 
this contact includes working closely in the field to facilitate problem resolution  and hour availability 
employees of our customers become accustomed to working closely with and depending on our personnel for assistance  guidance  advice  and in other areas where teams typically interact 
our objective is for our customers to see our employees as an extension of the customers employees and resources 
these relationships not only secure business long term  but also generate additional business as new opportunities arise 
our sales representatives and executives perform more traditional sales activities such as calling on customers  sending proposals  and following up on jobs to ensure customer satisfaction 
this includes heavy participation in customer safety programs where our executives and sales staff either participate in or teach safety classes at various customer locations 
from a sales standpoint  this close involvement and support is key to establishing and maintaining long term relationships with the major oil and natural gas companies 
we cross market our well servicing rigs along with our fluid logistics services  thereby offering our customers the ability to minimize vendors  which we believe improves the efficiency of our customers 
this is demonstrated by the fact that of our revenues for the year ended december  were from customers that utilized services of both of our business segments 
employees at december   we had  employees 
we provide comprehensive employee training and implement recognized standards for health and safety 
none of our employees are represented by a union or employed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or similar arrangement 
we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and we believe we have good relations with our employees 
continued retention of existing qualified management and field employees and availability of additional qualified management and field employees will be a critical factor in our continued success as we work to ensure that we have adequate levels of experienced personnel to service our customers 
this continues to be challenging 
competition our competition includes small regional service providers as well as larger companies with operations throughout the continental united states and internationally 
our largest competitors are basic energy services  inc  superior energy services  inc  heckman corporation  key energy services  inc  nabors industries ltd  and stallion oilfield services  ltd 
we believe that these larger competitors primarily have centralized management teams that direct their operations and decision making primarily from corporate and regional headquarters 
in addition  because of their size  these companies market a large 
table of contents portion of their work to the major oil and natural gas companies 
we compete primarily on the basis of the young age and quality of our equipment  our safety record  the quality and expertise of our employees  and our responsiveness to customer needs 
customers we served in excess of customers during the year ended december  for the years ended december   and  our largest customer in each year comprised approximately   and of our consolidated revenues  our five largest customers comprised approximately   and of our consolidated revenues  and our ten largest customers comprised approximately   and of our consolidated revenues 
during  no customer comprised or more of our consolidated revenues 
during  chesapeake energy corporation comprised of our consolidated revenues 
during  no customer comprised or more of our consolidated revenues 
we have discontinued operations in mexico and have not included pemex in this customer analysis  which if included would have represented  and of our consolidated revenues  including revenues from our discontinued operations  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
following an industry improvement in the last half of which continued through and during the second half of activity began to moderate 
this gradual decline in demand for energy services continued through year end the loss of our top customer or of several of the customers in the top ten would materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that lost revenues could be replaced in a timely manner or at all  especially given the market s competitiveness 
we have master service agreements in place with most of our customers  under which jobs or projects are awarded on the basis of price  type of service  location of equipment  and the experience level of work crews 
our business segments charge customers by the hour  by the day  or by the project for the services  equipment  and personnel we provide 
suppliers we purchase well servicing chemicals  drilling fluids  and related supplies from various third party suppliers 
we purchase potassium chloride from two suppliers agri empresa  inc and tetra technologies  inc for all other well servicing products  such as barite  surfactants  and drilling fluids  we purchase from various suppliers of well servicing products when needed 
although we do not have written agreements with any of our suppliers other than leases with respect to certain equipment  we have not historically suffered from an inability to purchase or lease equipment or purchase raw materials 
insurance our operations are subject to risks inherent in the oilfield services industry  such as equipment defects  malfunctions  failures and natural disasters 
in addition  hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations  pressures  blow outs  fires or other conditions may be encountered in drilling and servicing wells  as well as the transportation of fluids and our assets between locations 
we have obtained insurance coverage against certain of these risks which we believe is customary in the industry  including million in general liability per occurrence and million of excess liability coverage 
such insurance is subject to coverage limits and exclusions and may not be available for all of the risks and hazards to which we are exposed 
in addition  no assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate to cover our liabilities or will be generally available in the future or  if available  that premiums will be commercially justifiable 
if we incur substantial liability and such damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits  or if we incur such liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance  our business  results of operations  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
environmental regulations our operations are subject to and our operations in mexico  which were sold in january  were subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the united states pertaining to health  safety  and the environment 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent over the years  and in certain circumstances may impose strict liability  rendering us liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on our part 
moreover  cleanup costs  penalties and other damages arising as a result of new  or changes to existing  environmental laws and regulations could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we believe that we conduct our operations in substantial compliance with current united states federal  state  and local requirements related to health  safety and the environment 
the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations to which our operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or 
table of contents financial position 
see item a risk factors due to the nature of our business  we may be subject to environmental liability on page of this annual report on form k for further details 
the discussion below relates to the significant environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations that apply to our continuing operations  which excludes our mexican operations that were sold in january those mexican operations were subject to various mexican environmental  health and safety laws and regulations that are similar in scope and purpose as those governing our continuing us operations 
notwithstanding the fact that we have sold our mexican operations  we may still be subject to environmental liabilities under mexican law and under the indemnification provisions of the asset and membership interest purchase agreement that governed the disposition of our mexican operations  to the extent that our operations in mexico are deemed to have been in violation of mexican law 
nevertheless  we believe that we have conducted our operations in mexico in substantial compliance with mexican environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations 
hazardous substances and waste the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended  or cercla  and comparable state laws in the united states impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain defined persons  including current and prior owners or operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
under cercla  these responsible persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances  for damages to natural resources  and for the costs of certain health studies 
in the course of our operations  we generate materials that are regulated as hazardous substances and  as a result  may incur cercla liability for cleanup costs 
also  claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants 
we also generate solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended  or rcra  and comparable state statutes 
certain materials generated in the exploration  development  or production of crude oil and natural gas are excluded from rcra s hazardous waste regulation  under rcra subtitle c  but may be subject to regulation as a solid waste under rcra subtitle d 
moreover  these wastes  which include wastes currently generated during our operations  could be designated as hazardous wastes in the future and become subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements 
any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating expenses 
although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been released at properties owned or leased by us now or in the past  or at other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes were taken for treatment or disposal 
under cercla  rcra and analogous state laws  we could be required to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater  perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination  or pay for associated natural resource damages 
water discharges we operate facilities that are subject to requirements of the clean water act  as amended  or cwa  and analogous state laws that impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
pursuant to these laws  permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state waters or waters of the united states  including to discharge storm water runoff from certain types of facilities 
spill prevention  control  and countermeasure requirements under the cwa require implementation of measures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a hydrocarbon spill 
the cwa can impose substantial civil and criminal penalties for non compliance 
we believe that our disposal and equipment cleaning facilities are in substantial compliance with cwa requirements 
air emissions our facilities and operations are also subject to regulation under the clean air act caa and analogous state and local laws and regulations for air emissions 
changes in and scheduled implementation of these laws could lead to the imposition of new air pollution control requirements for our operations 
therefore  we may incur future capital expenditures to upgrade or modify air pollution control equipment or come into compliance where needed 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with caa requirements 
employee health and safety we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act  as amended  or osha  and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of employee health and safety 
osha s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations be maintained and provided to employees  state and local government authorities  and citizens 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with osha requirements 

table of contents climate change regulation the us congress has been considering legislation to reduce the emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide and methane  which according to certain scientific studies  might contribute to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
on june   the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of  or acesa  which would establish an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce us emissions of these greenhouse gases 
under this legislation  the epa would have issued a capped and steadily declining number of tradable emissions allowances to major sources of greenhouse gas emissions so that such sources could continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere 
these allowances would be expected to increase significantly in cost over time 
acesa would impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon based fuels such as oil and natural gas 
the us senate has never passed acesa and prospects for passage of comprehensive greenhouse gas legislation is not good at this time 
however  president obama has indicated his support of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an emission allowance system 
although it is not currently possible to predict when or if congress may act on climate change legislation or whether the epa would adopt more stringent regulation of greenhouse gases should congress not act on this subject  any future federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address the emission of greenhouse gases could adversely affect demand for our services by reducing demand for the oil and natural gas produced by our customers 
such legislation or regulations could also increase our operating costs 
additionally  on december   the epa announced its finding that greenhouse gas emissions presented an endangerment to human health and the environment 
these findings allow the epa to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
in september  the epa proposed regulations in anticipation of finalizing its endangerment finding that would require a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles and could also trigger permit review for greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources 
on october   the epa published a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states beginning in for emissions occurring in on november   the epa issued regulations requiring onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production  natural gas processing  transmission distribution and storage facilities  and facilities that inject and store carbon dioxide underground for the purposes of geologic sequestration or enhanced oil and gas recovery to report greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis 
reporting requirements under these new regulations were mandatory beginning in for emissions occurring in previously  the us congress had considered legislation that would regulate emission reporting and reduction and commodity hedging  and the us congress has evaluated proposals impacting onshore and offshore oil and gas activities and legislation such as the oil pollution act 
such legislation and proposals have the potential to increase the cost of business for us and our customers and to require changes in the manner in which we operate our business 
the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from  our equipment and operations and the equipment and operations of our customers could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for crude oil and natural gas produced by our customers  which would adversely affect demand for our services 
the potential increase in the costs of our operations and the operations of our customers could include additional costs to operate and maintain equipment and facilities  install new emission controls on equipment and facilities  acquire allowances to authorize greenhouse gas emissions  pay any taxes related to greenhouse gas emissions  and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program 
while we may be able to include some or all of such increased operating costs in the rates we charge for our services  any recovery of such costs is uncertain 
even if such legislation is not adopted at the national level  a number of states  acting either individually or through multi state regional initiatives  have already begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
while no such legislation is currently being considered in texas  many of our customers operate nationally and would be adversely affected by the requirements of such legislation 
any one of these climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
other laws and regulations we operate salt water disposal wells that are subject to the cwa  safe drinking water act  and state and local laws and regulations  including those established by the epa s underground injection control program which establishes the minimum program requirements 
our salt water disposal wells are located in texas  which requires us to obtain a permit to operate each of these wells 
we have such permits for each of our salt water disposal wells 
the texas regulatory agency may suspend or modify any of these permits if such well operation is likely to result in pollution of fresh water  substantial violation of permit conditions or applicable rules  or leaks to the environment 
we maintain insurance against some risks associated with our well service activities  but there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us 
the occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified 
table of contents could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
in addition  hydraulic fracturing practices have come under increased scrutiny in recent years as various regulatory bodies and public interest groups investigate the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on fresh water sources 
risks associated with potential regulation of hydraulic fracturing are discussed in more detail under item a 
risk factors  federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased cost and additional operating restrictions or delays 
prior the disposition of our operations and substantially all the assets located in mexico  all work related to the development of oil and other petrochemicals  including work related to oil wells  must have been authorized by mexican authorities  which required an environmental impact statement related to such work

item a 
risk factors the following information describes certain significant risks and uncertainties inherent in our business 
you should take these risks into account in evaluating us 
this section does not describe all risks applicable to us  our industry or our business  and it is intended only as a summary of known material risks that are specific to the company 
you should carefully consider such risks and uncertainties together with the other information contained in this form k 
if any of such risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially and could differ materially from the plans and other forward looking statements included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k and elsewhere herein 
risks relating to our business the industry in which we operate is highly volatile and dependent on domestic spending by the oil and natural gas industry  and there can be no assurance that our current levels of utilization  demand for our services  or current pricing will continue 
the levels of utilization  demand  pricing  and terms for oilfield services in our existing or future service areas largely depend upon the level of exploration and development activity for both crude oil and natural gas in the united states 
oil and natural gas industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control  including oil and natural gas prices  expectations about future oil and natural gas prices  levels of supply and consumer demand  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and natural gas  the expected rates of current production  the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves  available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity  political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries  merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers  political  regulatory and economic conditions  and the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise equity capital or debt financing 

table of contents our operations may be materially affected by severe weather conditions  such as hurricanes  drought  or extreme temperatures 
such events could result in evacuation of personnel  suspension of operations or damage to equipment and facilities 
damage from adverse weather conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we expect that a continuation of currently depressed natural gas prices or a reduction in oil prices would have a negative effect on oil and natural gas production levels and therefore affect the demand for drilling and well services by oil and natural gas companies 
any addition to  or elimination or curtailment of  government incentives for companies involved in the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas could have a significant effect on the oilfield services industry in the united states 
lower oil and natural gas prices could also cause our customers to seek to terminate  renegotiate  or fail to honor our services contracts 
a continued decrease in utilization  demand for our services  and pricing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the global financial markets and the continuing worldwide economic slowdown 
despite recent modest improvements  our future results may be impacted by the continuing worldwide economic slowdown  inflation  deflation  or other adverse economic conditions 
these conditions may negatively affect us or parties with whom we do business 
the impact on such third parties could result in their non payment or inability to perform obligations owed to us such as the failure of customers to honor their commitments or the failure of major suppliers to complete orders 
additionally  credit market conditions may change slowing our collection efforts as customers may experience increased difficulty in obtaining requisite financing  potentially leading to lost revenue and higher than normal accounts receivable 
this could result in greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 
a continuation or deterioration of the economic uncertainty may cause institutional investors to respond to their customers by increasing interest rates  enacting tighter lending standards  or refusing to refinance existing debt upon its maturity or on terms similar to the expiring debt 
we may require additional capital in the future 
however  due to the above listed factors  we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available if needed and  to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
our indebtedness and operating lease commitments could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions 
as of december   our long term debt  including current portions  was million and our annual commitment for operating leases for was million 
in the event we experience a decline in activity  our level of indebtedness and operating lease payment obligations may adversely affect operations and limit our growth 
our level of indebtedness and operating lease payments may affect our operations in several ways  including the following by increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  due to the fact that the covenants that are contained in the indenture governing our senior notes and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility limit our ability to borrow funds  dispose of assets  pay dividends and make certain investments  due to the fact that any failure to comply with the covenants of our indenture and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility including failure to make the required interest payments could result in an event of default  which could result in some or all of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable  and due to the fact that our level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  or other general corporate purposes 
these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows  and the ability to satisfy the obligations under our indentures and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility 
further  due to cross default provisions in the indenture governing our senior notes and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility  with certain exceptions  a default and acceleration of outstanding debt under one debt agreement would result in the default and possible acceleration of outstanding debt under the other debt agreement 
accordingly  an event of default could result in all or a portion of our outstanding debt under our debt agreements becoming immediately due and payable 
if this occurred  we might not be able to obtain waivers or secure alternative financing to satisfy all of our obligations simultaneously  which might even force us to seek bankruptcy protection 

table of contents impairment of our long term assets may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations 
we evaluate our long term assets including property  equipment  and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us we use estimated future cash flows in assessing recoverability of our long lived assets 
the cash flow projections are based on our current estimates and judgmental assessments 
we perform this assessment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our net assets may not be recoverable due to various external or internal factors  termed a triggering event 
based on our evaluation for the year ended december   no impairment was recorded 
nevertheless  volatility in the oil and natural gas industry  which is driven by factors over which we have no control  could affect the fair market value of our equipment fleet 
under specific circumstances  this could trigger a write down of our assets for accounting purposes  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we may be unable to maintain or increase pricing on our core services 
we may periodically seek to increase the prices on our services to offset rising costs or to generate higher returns for our shareholders 
however  we operate in a very competitive industry and  as a result  we are not always successful in raising or maintaining our existing prices 
additionally  during periods of increased market demand  a significant amount of new service capacity may enter the market  which also puts pressure on the pricing of our services and limits our ability to increase prices 
even when we are able to increase our prices  we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset such rising costs 
in periods of high demand for oilfield services  a tighter labor market may result in higher labor costs 
during such periods  our labor costs could increase at a greater rate than our ability to raise prices for our services 
also  we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our activity levels 
the inability to maintain or increase our pricing as costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  and results of operations 
the industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
the oilfield services industry is highly competitive and we compete with a substantial number of companies  some of which have greater technical and financial resources than we have 
our largest competitors performing both well servicing and fluid logistics are basic energy services  inc  superior energy services  inc  key energy services  inc  and nabors industries ltd 
our largest competitors that compete only with our fluid logistics and other segment are heckman corporation and stallion oilfield services ltd 
our ability to generate revenues and earnings depends primarily upon our ability to win bids in competitive bidding processes and to perform awarded projects within estimated times and costs 
there can be no assurance that competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products and services that compete with ours  or that new or existing competitors will not enter the various markets in which we are active 
in certain aspects of our business  we also compete with a number of small and medium sized companies that  like us  have certain competitive advantages such as low overhead costs and specialized regional strengths 
in addition  reduced levels of activity in the oil and natural gas industry could intensify competition and the pressure on competitive pricing and may result in lower revenues or margins to us 
the indenture governing the senior notes and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict or limit our ability to operate our business 
the indenture governing the senior notes and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility contain covenants that restrict or limit our ability to take various actions  such as incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness or issuing disqualified capital stock  creating or incurring liens  engaging in business other than our current business and reasonably related extensions thereof  making loans and investments  paying certain dividends  distributions  redeeming subordinated indebtedness or making other restricted payments  incurring dividend or other payment restrictions affecting certain subsidiaries  transferring or selling assets  entering into transactions with affiliates  and consummating a merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 

table of contents the restrictions contained in the indentures could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions  meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to fund our operations  enter into acquisitions  or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest 
our customer base is concentrated within the oil and natural gas production industry and loss of a significant customer could cause our revenue to decline substantially 
we served in excess of and customers for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for those same time periods  our largest customer comprised approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues  our five largest customers comprised approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues  and our top ten customers comprised approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues 
our top customers amounted to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the loss of our top customer or of several of our top customers would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we may be able to replace customers lost with other customers  but there can be no assurance that lost revenues could be replaced in a timely manner  with the same margins or at all 
we are subject to the risk of technological obsolescence 
we anticipate that our ability to maintain our current business and win new business will depend upon continuous improvements in operating equipment  among other things 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts in this regard or that we will have the resources available to continue to support this need to have our equipment remain technologically up to date and competitive 
our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us 
no assurances can be given that competitors will not achieve technological advantages over us 
we are highly dependent on certain of our officers and key employees 
our success is dependent upon our key management  technical and field personnel  especially john e 
crisp  our president and chief executive officer  and charles c 
forbes  our executive vice president and chief operating officer 
any loss of the services of either one of these officers  or managers with strong relationships with customers or suppliers  or a sufficient number of other employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
our ability to expand our services is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees 
the ability to secure the services of additional personnel may be constrained in times of strong industry activity 
we expect that we will continue to incur significant costs as a result of being obligated to comply with securities exchange act reporting requirements  the sarbanes oxley act  and our indenture and loan agreement covenants and that our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance matters 
under the indenture governing our senior notes and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility  we are required to comply with several covenants  including requirements to deliver certain opinions and certificates  and file reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act  with the securities and exchange commission  or the sec 
in august  we registered our class of common stock under section of the exchange act 
as a result  we have reporting requirements under the exchange act 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of  and rules subsequently implemented by the sec  have imposed various requirements on public companies  including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure controls and procedures  internal controls  and corporate governance practices 
accordingly  we expect to continue to incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses 
we anticipate that our management and other personnel will continue to devote a substantial amount of time and resources to comply with these requirements 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires  among other things  that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure 
we have performed and will perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of our historical testing has  and our future testing may  reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in addition to the one discussed below that was revealed in our most recent evaluation 
we expect to continue to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance  in particular with section moreover  if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner  if we identify  or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies  possible future deficiencies in our internal controls in addition to those discussed below that are deemed to be material weaknesses or if we fail to adequately address existing and future deficiencies  we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities  which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources 

table of contents we face several risks relating to a material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we identified control deficiencies that constitutes material weaknesses in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting 
the following material weakness was present at december    and we did not design or maintain effective controls over the billing process to ensure timely recognition of revenue 
specifically  we identified field tickets  which represented completed but unbilled revenue that had not been entered resulting in a post closing adjustment 
this control deficiency could result in a future material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected 
accordingly  we have determined that the above control deficiency represents a material weakness 
the following material weakness was present as of december  we did not design and maintain effective controls over the review of the accuracy of the income tax provision related to foreign taxes 
this material weakness resulted in entering post closing adjustments to the consolidated financial statements 
this control deficiency would have resulted in a material misstatement to the annual consolidated financial statements 
however  it was corrected in a post closing adjustment 
accordingly  we have determined that the above control deficiency represents a material weakness 
internal control deficiencies could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
in addition  even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures  our controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements 
we can give no assurance that the measures we have taken to date  or any future measures we may take  will remediate the material weakness identified  or that any additional material weaknesses and significant deficiencies or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls 
please see item a 
controls and procedures of this annual report on form k for a description of certain measures we have undertaken to remediate our material weakness and significant deficiencies 
we engage in transactions with related parties and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on us 
we have entered into a significant number of transactions with related parties 
the details of certain of these transactions are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
related party transactions create the possibility of conflicts of interest with regard to our management 
such a conflict could cause an individual in our management to seek to advance his or her economic interests above those of the company 
further  the appearance of conflicts of interest created by related party transactions could impair the confidence of our investors 
our board of directors regularly reviews these transactions and  as required by the company s indenture  seeks the approval of the disinterested board members when such a transaction exceeds an aggregate consideration of  and an opinion regarding the fairness of such transaction from an outside firm when such a transaction exceeds an aggregate consideration of million 
notwithstanding this  it is possible that a conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
activity in the oilfield services industry is seasonal and may affect our revenues during certain periods 
our operations are impacted by seasonal factors 
historically  our business has been negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather  fewer daylight hours  and holidays 
our well servicing rigs are mobile  and we operate a significant number of oilfield vehicles 
during periods of heavy snow  ice or rain  we may not be able to move our equipment between locations  thereby reducing our ability to generate rig or truck hours 
in addition  the majority of our well servicing rigs work only during daylight hours 
in the winter months as daylight time becomes shorter  the amount of time that the well servicing rigs work is shortened  which has a negative impact on total hours worked 
finally  we historically have experienced significant slowdown during the thanksgiving and christmas holiday seasons 

table of contents we rely heavily on our suppliers and do not maintain written agreements with any such suppliers 
our ability to compete and grow will be dependent on our access to equipment  including well servicing rigs  parts  and components  among other things  at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner 
we do not maintain written agreements with any of our suppliers other than operating leases for certain equipment  and we are  therefore  dependent on the relationships we maintain with them 
failure of suppliers to deliver such equipment  parts and components at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner would be detrimental to our ability to maintain existing customers and obtain new customers 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in maintaining our required supply of such items 
we rely heavily on two suppliers  agri empresa  inc and tetra technologies  inc  for potassium chloride  a principal raw material that is critical for our operations 
while the materials are generally available  if we were to have a problem sourcing raw materials or transporting these materials from one of these two vendors  our ability to provide some of our services could be limited 
alternate suppliers exist for all other raw materials 
the source and supply of materials has been consistent in the past  however  in periods of high industry activity  periodic shortages of certain materials have been experienced and costs have been affected 
we do not have contracts with  but we do maintain relationships with  a number of suppliers in an attempt to mitigate this risk 
however  if current or future suppliers are unable to provide the necessary raw materials  or otherwise fail to deliver products in the quantities required  any resulting delays in the provision of services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
we do not maintain written agreements with respect to some of our salt water disposal wells 
our ability to continue to provide well maintenance services depends on our continued access to salt water disposal wells 
several of our currently active salt water disposal wells are not subject to written operating agreements or are located on the premises of third parties who have not entered into a written lease with us 
we do not maintain written surface leases or right of way agreements with these third parties and we are  therefore  dependent on the relationships we maintain with them 
failure to maintain relationships with these third parties could impair our ability to access and maintain the applicable salt water disposal wells and any well servicing equipment located on their property 
if that occurred  we would increase the levels of fluid injection at our remaining salt water disposal wells 
however  our permits to inject fluid into the salt water disposal wells is subject to maximum pressure limitations and if multiple salt water disposal wells became unavailable  this might adversely impact our operations 
we extend credit to our customers which presents a risk of non payment 
a substantial portion of our accounts receivable are with customers involved in the oil and natural gas industry  whose revenues may be affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
collection of these receivables could be influenced by economic factors affecting this industry 
due to the nature of our business  we may be subject to environmental liability 
our business operations and ownership of real property are subject to numerous united states federal  state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  including those relating to emissions to air  discharges to water  treatment  storage and disposal of regulated materials  and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination 
our operations in mexico  which were disposed in january  were subject to equivalent mexico laws 
the nature of our business  including operations at our current and former facilities by prior owners  lessors or operators  exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production  generation  storage  use  transportation  and disposal of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment 
environmental laws and regulations may have a significant effect on the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials as well as the costs of the transportation  treatment  storage  and disposal of wastes 
we believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental and worker health and safety requirements 
however  we may incur substantial costs  including fines  damages  criminal or civil sanctions  remediation costs  or experience interruptions in our operations for violations or liabilities arising under these laws and regulations 
although we may have the benefit of insurance maintained by our customers or by other third parties or by us such insurances may not cover every expense 
further  we may become liable for damages against which we cannot adequately insure or against which we may elect not to insure because of high costs or other reasons 
our customers are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations  as well as limits on emissions to the air and discharges into surface and sub surface waters 
although regulatory developments that may occur in subsequent years could have the effect of reducing industry activity  we cannot predict the nature of any new restrictions or regulations that may be imposed 
we may be required to increase operating expenses or capital expenditures in order to comply with any new restrictions or regulations 

table of contents climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services 
the us congress has been considering legislation to reduce the emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide and methane  which according to certain scientific studies  might contribute to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
on june   the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of  or acesa  which would establish an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce us emissions of these greenhouse gases 
under this legislation  the epa would have issued a capped and steadily declining number of tradable emissions allowances to major sources of greenhouse gas emissions so that such sources could continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere 
these allowances would be expected to increase significantly in cost over time 
acesa would impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon based fuels such as oil and natural gas 
the us senate has never passed acesa and prospects for passage of comprehensive greenhouse gas legislation is not good at this time 
however  president obama has indicated his support of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an emission allowance system 
although it is not currently possible to predict when or if congress may act on climate change legislation or whether the epa would adopt more stringent regulation of greenhouse gases should congress not act on this subject  any future federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address the emission of greenhouse gases could adversely affect demand for our services by reducing demand for the oil and natural gas produced by our customers 
such legislation or regulations could also increase our operating costs 
additionally  on december   the epa announced its finding that greenhouse gas emissions presented an endangerment to human health and the environment 
these findings allow the epa to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
in september  the epa proposed regulations in anticipation of finalizing its endangerment finding that would require a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles and could also trigger permit review for greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources 
on october   the epa published a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states beginning in for emissions occurring in on november   the epa issued regulations requiring onshore and offshore petroleum and natural gas production  natural gas processing  transmission distribution and storage facilities  and facilities that inject and store carbon dioxide underground for the purposes of geologic sequestration or enhanced oil and gas recovery to report greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis 
reporting requirements under these new regulations were mandatory beginning in for emissions occurring in previously  the us congress had considered legislation that would regulate emission reporting and reduction and commodity hedging  and the us congress has evaluated proposals impacting onshore and offshore oil and gas activities and legislation such as the oil pollution act 
such legislation and proposals have the potential to increase the cost of business for us and our customers and to require changes in the manner in which we operate our business 
the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from  our equipment and operations and the equipment and operations of our customers could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for crude oil and natural gas produced by our customers  which would adversely affect demand for our services 
the potential increase in the costs of our operations and the operations of our customers could include additional costs to operate and maintain equipment and facilities  install new emission controls on equipment and facilities  acquire allowances to authorize greenhouse gas emissions  pay any taxes related to greenhouse gas emissions  and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program 
while we may be able to include some or all of such increased operating costs in the rates we charge for our services  any recovery of such costs is uncertain 
even if such legislation is not adopted at the national level  a number of states  acting either individually or through multi state regional initiatives  have already begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
while no such legislation is currently being considered in texas  many of our customers operate nationally and would be adversely affected by the requirements of such legislation 
any one of these climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
significant physical effects of climatic change  if they should occur  have the potential to damage oil and natural gas facilities  disrupt production activities and could cause us or our customers to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 
in an interpretative guidance on climate change disclosures  the sec indicates that climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather including hurricanes and floods  sea levels  the arability of farmland  and water availability and quality 
if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations or the assets and operations of our customers 
we may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages  losses  or costs that may result should the potential physical effects of climate change occur 
unrecovered damages and losses incurred by our 
table of contents customers could result in decreased demand for our services 
increasing trucking regulations may increase our costs and negatively affect our results of operations 
in connection with the services we provide  we operate as a motor carrier and  therefore  are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation  or us dot  and by various state agencies 
these regulatory authorities exercise broad powers  governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety 
there are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry  including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements 
the trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services 
some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations and changes in the regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period  onboard black box recorder devices  or limits on vehicle weight and size 
interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the us dot 
to a large degree  intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations 
such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations 
from time to time  various legislative proposals are introduced  including proposals to increase federal  state  or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels  which may increase our costs or adversely affect the recruitment of drivers 
management cannot predict whether  or in what form  any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted 
we may be required to increase operating expenses or capital expenditures in order to comply with any new restrictions or regulations 
we are subject to extensive additional governmental regulation 
in addition to environmental and trucking regulations  our operations are subject to a variety of other united states federal  state  and local laws  regulations and guidelines  including laws and regulations relating to health and safety  the conduct of operations  and the manufacture  management  transportation  storage and disposal of certain materials used in our operations 
our previous mexican operations were subject to equivalent mexican laws 
also  we may become subject to such regulation in any new jurisdiction in which we may operate 
we believe that we are in compliance with such laws  regulations and guidelines 
although we continue to enhance our infrastructure  we have invested financial and managerial resources to comply with applicable laws  regulations and guidelines and expect to continue to do so in the future 
although regulatory expenditures have not  historically  been material to us  such laws  regulations and guidelines are subject to change 
accordingly  it is impossible for us to predict the cost or effect of such laws  regulations  or guidelines on our future operations 
our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
as of january   we had us federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
generally  net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards  may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce or eliminate us federal income taxes 
if we were to experience a change in ownership within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  however  our ability to utilize our nols might be significantly limited or possibly eliminated 
a change of ownership under section is defined as a cumulative change of or more in the ownership positions of certain shareholders over a three year period 
based on our review of the issue  we do not believe that we have experienced an ownership change under section of the code 
however  the issuance of additional equity in the future may result in an ownership change pursuant to section of the code 
in addition  an ownership change under section could be caused by circumstances beyond our control  such as market purchases of our stock 
thus  there can be no assurance that we will not experience an ownership change that would limit our application of our net operating loss carryforwards in calculating future federal tax liabilities 
our operations are inherently risky  and insurance may not always be available in amounts sufficient to fully protect us 
we have an insurance and risk management program in place to protect our assets  operations  and employees 
we also have programs in place to address compliance with current safety and regulatory standards 
however  our operations are subject to risks inherent in the oilfield services industry  such as equipment defects  malfunctions  failures  accidents  and natural disasters 
in addition  hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations  pressures  blow outs  fires  or other conditions may be encountered in drilling and servicing wells  as well as the transportation of fluids and company assets between locations 
these risks and hazards could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury  loss of life  business interruption  property damage or destruction  pollution  and other environmental damages 

table of contents although we have obtained insurance against certain of these risks  such insurance is subject to coverage limits and exclusions and may not be available for the risks and hazards to which we are exposed 
in addition  no assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate to cover our liabilities or will be generally available in the future or  if available  that premiums will be commercially justifiable 
if we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits  or if we were to incur such liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance  our business  results of operations  and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the market for oil and natural gas may be adversely affected by global demands to curtail use of such fuels 
fuel conservation measures  alternative fuel requirements  increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce the demand for oil and other liquid hydrocarbons 
we cannot predict the effect of changing demand for oil and natural gas products  and any major changes may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we cannot predict how an exit by any of our founding principal equity investors could affect our operations or business 
as of march   john e 
crisp  charles c 
forbes and janet l 
forbes  our founding principal equity holders  beneficially owned   and  respectively  of our common stock 
our founding principal equity investors may transfer their interests in us or engage in other business combination transactions with a third party that could result in a change in ownership or a change of control of us 
any transfer of an equity interest in us or a change of control could affect our governance 
we cannot be certain that such equity investors will not sell  transfer  or otherwise modify their ownership interest in us  whether in transactions involving third parties or other investors  nor can we predict how a change of equity investors or change of control would affect our operations or business 
our principal equity investors control important decisions affecting our governance and our operations  and their interests may differ from those of our other shareholders 
circumstances may arise in which the interest of our principal equity investors could be in conflict with those of the other shareholders 
in particular  our principal equity investors may have an interest in pursuing certain strategies or transactions that  in their judgment  enhance the value of their investment in us even though these strategies or transactions may involve risks to other shareholders 
although texas corporate law provides certain procedural protections and requires that certain business combinations between us and certain interested or affiliated shareholders meet certain approval requirements  this does not address all conflicts of interest that may arise 
for example  our principal equity investors and their affiliates are not prohibited from competing with us 
because our principal equity investors control us  conflicts of interest arising because of competition between us and a principal equity investor could be resolved in a manner adverse to us 
it is possible that there will be situations where our principal equity investors interests are in conflict with our interests  and our principal equity investors acting through the board of directors or through our executive officers could resolve these conflicts in a manner adverse to us 
we have anti takeover provisions in our organizational and other documents that may discourage a change of control 
our organizational documents contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions provide for the following restrictions on the time period in which directors may be nominated  the ability of our board of directors to determine the powers  preferences and rights of the preferred stock and to authorize the issuance of shares of such stock without shareholder approval  and requirements that a majority of the members of our board of directors approve certain corporate transactions 
we also have a shareholder rights plan which can make it difficult for anyone to accumulate more than a certain percentage of our outstanding equity without approval of our board of directors 
these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the third party s offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders 
as a result  shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 
future legal proceedings could adversely affect us and our operations 
given the nature of our business  we are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
while we are not presently a party to any material legal proceedings  legal proceedings could be filed against us in the future 
no assurance can be given as to the final outcome of any legal proceedings or that the ultimate resolution of any legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents we may not be able to fully integrate future acquisitions 
we may undertake future acquisitions of businesses and assets in the ordinary course of business 
achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on having the acquired assets perform as expected  successfully consolidating functions  retaining key employees and customer relationships  and integrating operations and procedures in a timely and efficient manner 
such integration may require substantial management effort  time  and resources and may divert management s focus from other strategic opportunities and operational matters  and ultimately we may fail to realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased cost and additional operating restrictions or delays 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons  particularly natural gas  from tight formations 
hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water  sand  and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions but the epa and other federal agencies are evaluating the practice  as evidenced by the epa providing advisory materials under the safe drinking water act 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities  and a committee of the us house of representatives is also conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the epa investigation preliminarily concluded that groundwater contamination in wyoming resulted from the process  and the epa asserted that an operator caused groundwater contamination in texas 
although the epa investigations have been criticized and the railroad commission of texas determined the evidence did not support the epa s assertion against operators in texas  the examination of the process could result in increased regulation  lawsuits  or claims of injury to groundwater or communities 
for example  the us department of energy composed a list of practices to follow in order to protect groundwater in shale gas production 
legislation has been introduced before congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process 
in addition  some states  including some states in which we operate such as texas have adopted and other states are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances 
a law enacted by the texas legislature and a rule enacted by the railroad commission of texas in require disclosure regarding the composition of hydraulic fracturing products to certain parties  including the railroad commission of texas 
if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted  such laws could make it more difficult or costly for producers to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations 
in addition  if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level  fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements  and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs 
the prohibition or restriction of hydraulic fracturing on the part of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the dividend  liquidation  and redemption rights of the holders of our series b senior convertible preferred stock may adversely affect our financial position and the rights of the holders of our common stock 
we have shares of series b senior convertible preferred stock  or the series b preferred stock  outstanding 
we have the obligation to pay to the holders of our series b preferred stock quarterly dividends of five percent per annum of the original issue price  payable quarterly in cash or in kind 
no dividends may be paid to holders of common stock while accumulated dividends remain unpaid on the series b preferred stock 
we are current on dividends through the quarterly period ended february  further  we are required  at the seventh anniversary of the issuance of the series b preferred stock on may   to redeem any such outstanding shares at their original issue price  plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends  to be paid  at our election  in cash or shares of common stock 
the payment of the redemption price in cash is expected to result in reduced capital resources available to the company 
the payment of the redemption price in shares of common stock would directly dilute the common shareholders 
the payment of dividends in kind would also have a dilutive effect on the common shareholders as any series b preferred stock issued as dividends will be themselves convertible into common shares 
in the event that the company is liquidated while shares of series b preferred stock is outstanding  holders of the series b preferred stock will be entitled to receive a preferred liquidation distribution  plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends  before holders of common stock receive any distributions 
holders of the series b preferred stock have certain voting and other rights that may adversely affect holders of our common stock  and the holders of our series b preferred stock may have different interests from  and vote their shares in a manner deemed adverse to  holders of our common stock 
in the event that we fail to pay dividends  in cash or in kind  on the series b preferred stock for an aggregate of at least eight quarterly dividend periods whether or not consecutive  the holders of the series b preferred stock will be entitled to vote at any meeting of the shareholders with the holders of the common shares and to cast the number of votes equal to the 
table of contents number of shares of whole common stock into which the series b preferred stock held by such holders are then convertible 
if the holders of the current series b preferred stock were able to vote pursuant to this provision at this time or converted the series b preferred stock into common stock  we believe that  as of march   those holders would be entitled to an aggregate of  votes resulting from their ownership of series b preferred stock  based on share holding information provided to us by the current holder of the series b preferred stock 
this together with common shares already held by these shareholders as reported to us by such shareholders  would entitle these shareholders to just under  in the aggregate  of the voting power of the company 
further  the holders of series b preferred stock may have certain voting rights with respect to the approval of amendments to the certificate of formation of the company or certain transactions between the company and affiliate shareholders 
the holders of series b preferred stock may have different interests from the holders of our common stock and could vote their shares in a manner deemed adverse to the holders of common stock

we believe that our broad range of services  which extends from initial drilling  through production  to eventual abandonment  is fundamental to establishing and maintaining the flow of oil and natural gas throughout the life cycle of our customers wells 
we currently provide a wide range of services to a diverse group of companies 
over the year ended december   we provided services to over companies 
our blue chip customer base includes anadarko petroleum corporation  chesapeake energy corporation  conocophillips company  rosetta resources  inc  and shell oil company  among others 
john e 
crisp and charles c 
forbes  our senior management team  have cultivated deep and ongoing relationships with these customers during their average of approximately years of experience in the oilfield services industry 
for the year ended december   we generated consolidated revenues of approximately million 
we currently conduct our operations through the following two business segments well servicing 
the well servicing segment comprised of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  at december   our well servicing segment utilized our modern fleet of owned well servicing rigs  which included workover rigs and ten swabbing rigs  four coiled tubing spreads  nine tubing testing units  and related assets and equipment 
these assets are used to provide i well maintenance  including remedial repairs and removal and replacement of downhole production equipment  ii well workovers  including significant downhole repairs  re completions and re perforations  iii completion and swabbing activities  iv plugging and abandonment services  and v testing of oil and natural gas production tubing 
fluid logistics and other 
the fluid logistics and other segment comprised of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  our fluid logistics and other segment utilized our fleet of owned or leased fluid transport trucks and related assets  including specialized vacuum  high pressure pump and tank trucks  frac tanks  water wells  salt water disposal wells and facilities  and related equipment 
these assets are used to provide  transport  store  and dispose of a variety of drilling and produced fluids used in  and generated by  oil and natural gas production 
these services are required in most workover and completion projects and are routinely used in daily operations of producing wells 
during and  we also provided additional services in which wolverine construction  inc  a related party  completed such services as a sub contractor 
these services involved site preparation and were complementary to the traditional services we offered 
we ceased offering these services in june prior to such termination  we would pay wolverine for their services and materials then would bill the cost to the customer with a margin of 
we believe that our two business segments are complementary and create synergies in terms of selling opportunities 
our multiple lines of service are designed to capitalize on our existing customer base to grow it within existing markets  generate more business from existing customers  and increase our operating performance 
by offering our customers the ability to reduce the number of vendors they use  we believe that we help improve our customers efficiency 
this is demonstrated by the fact that of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were from customers that utilized services of both of our business segments 
further  by having multiple service offerings that span the life cycle of the well  we believe that we have a competitive advantage over smaller competitors offering more limited services 

table of contents factors affecting results of operations oil and natural gas prices demand for well servicing and fluid logistics services is generally a function of the willingness of oil and natural gas companies to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for  develop  and produce oil and natural gas  which in turn is affected by current and anticipated levels of oil and natural gas prices 
exploration and production spending is generally categorized as either operating expenditures or capital expenditures 
activities by oil and natural gas companies designed to add oil and natural gas reserves are classified as capital expenditures  and those associated with maintaining or accelerating production  such as workover and fluid logistics services  are categorized as operating expenditures 
operating expenditures are typically more stable than capital expenditures and are less sensitive to oil and natural gas price volatility 
in contrast  capital expenditures by oil and natural gas companies for drilling are more directly influenced by current and expected oil and natural gas prices and generally reflect the volatility of commodity prices 
workover rig rates our well servicing segment revenues are dependent on the prevailing market rates for workover rigs 
rates and utilization for workover rigs increased in march through the third quarter of  then rates and utilization stabilized in the fourth quarter of  which continued through the first half of rates have been stable through the twelve months ending december  while utilization has slightly decreased during the second half of fluid logistics rates our fluid logistics and other segment revenues are dependent on the prevailing market rates for fluid transport trucks and the related assets  including specialized vacuum  high pressure pump and tank trucks  frac tanks and salt water disposal wells 
pricing and utilization increased in the latter portion of the first quarter and continued through rates and utilization stabilized through the beginning of before dropping through the second half of this drop in the second half of was partially due to the increase in supply of fluid logistics equipment in the markets where the company operates 
operating expenses as utilization and demand increased beginning in and continued through the beginning of  we have experienced cost pressures in areas such as labor where we have incurred additional cost increases primarily in the form of increased pay rates 
future earnings and cash flows will be dependent on our ability to manage our overall cost structure and either maintain our existing prices or obtain price increases from our customers as our operating costs increase 
equipment rental and lease costs continue to be a significant component of our operating expenses 
as described in the following paragraph  we made certain capital expenditures throughout that replaced certain leased or rented equipment 
nevertheless  we expect that we will continue to meet certain equipment needs through rental or leasing arrangements 
during  we entered into operating leases for vacuum trucks  vacuum trailers  support trucks  pressure pumping units  crane trucks  nitrogen pumping units  and a transport trailer 
capital expenditures and debt service obligations during  we purchased  frac tanks  vacuum trailers  vacuum trucks  seven salt water disposal wells  four coiled tubing spreads  two pump down units  three workover rigs  and made various improvements at several locations 
during late and early of  we began increasing our fleet of vacuum trucks and frac tanks in response to industry activity 
all of the frac tanks acquired during were purchased and all of the trucks and trailers were leased 
as a result of the indebtedness we incurred for capital expenditures and leases  we have significantly increased our debt service and lease obligations 
capital expenditures for the twelve months ended december  were million 
certain of these purchased assets took the place of equipment that the company had been leasing or renting or allowed the company to provide services to customers that it had previously offered through third party contractors 
other equipment acquisitions were made to increase the company overall capacity 
as of january  the company has commitments to purchase one coiled tubing spread and four nitrogen pumping units that should be delivered during the first half of the four nitrogen pumping units will be used in the coiled tubing part of our well servicing operations 
of the equipment on order  the coiled tubing spread will be purchased partially in cash and partially through debt financing and the remaining nitrogen pumping units will be acquired through operating leases or with cash 
we plan to finance a portion of the remaining equipment on order  including the last coiled tubing unit  pursuant to a loan and security agreement with regions equipment finance corporation and regions commercial equipment finance  llc  collectively  the regions finance facility  discussed in further detail below 
however  this existing agreement does not constitute a commitment to finance any additional loans or capital leases or enter into any additional operating leases 

table of contents nevertheless  we believe that our cash flows from operations and availability under our million revolving credit facility  on their own  will  if necessary  be sufficient to fund or otherwise satisfy the obligations related to this equipment on order 
operating income margins while we experienced more favorable margins in the fluid logistics and other segment relative to the well servicing segment in  downward pressure on margins in the fluid logistics and other segment has reduced this difference 
a significant portion of the additional activity in the fluid logistics and other segment relates to expanded fracturing operations in our market areas

liquidity and capital resources overview in june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and received net proceeds of million 
we used a substantial portion of the proceeds from such offering to purchase or redeem all outstanding second priority notes and first priority notes 
on september   we entered into a loan and security agreement with certain lenders and regions bank  as agent for the secured parties  or the agent 
the loan and security agreement provides for an asset based revolving credit facility with a maximum initial credit of million  subject to borrowing base availability 
as of december   million was available under this new credit facility due to million in outstanding letters of credit 
a downturn could require us to seek funding to meet working capital requirements 
further  should management elect to incur capital expenditures in excess of the levels projected for  which are currently projected at million or to pursue other capital intensive activities  additional capital may be required to fund these activities 
as discussed in more detail below  our ability to seek additional financing may be restricted by certain of our debt covenants 
the indenture governing the senior notes and the loan agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility impose significant restrictions on us and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions that could limit our ability to obtain additional or replacement financing 
for example  the indenture governing the senior notes only allows us to incur indebtedness  other than certain specific types of permitted indebtedness  if such indebtedness is unsecured and if the fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indenture for the most recently completed four full fiscal quarters is at least to our new credit facility only allows us to incur specific types of permitted indebtedness  which includes a million basket of permitted indebtedness for capital leases  mortgage financings or purchase money obligations incurred for the purpose of installation or improvement of property  plant  and equipment 
our inability to satisfy our obligations under the indenture governing the senior notes  the loan agreement governing our credit facility  and any future debt agreements we may enter into could constitute an event of default under one or more of such agreements 
further  due to cross default provisions in our debt agreements  a default and acceleration of our outstanding debt under one debt agreement may result in the default and acceleration of outstanding debt under the other debt agreements 
accordingly  an event of default could result in all or a portion of our outstanding debt becoming immediately due and payable 
if this should occur  we might not be able to obtain waivers or secure alternative financing to satisfy all of our obligations simultaneously 
given the continuing weakness in the global economy  our ability to access the capital markets or to consummate any asset sales might be restricted at a time when we would like or need to raise capital 
these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows  and our ability to satisfy our obligations 
within certain constraints  we can conserve capital by reducing or delaying capital expenditures  deferring non regulatory maintenance expenditures  and further reducing operating and administrative costs 
we have historically funded our operations  including capital expenditures  with bank borrowings  vendor financings  cash flow from operations  the issuance of our senior notes  and the proceeds from our may canadian initial public equity offering and simultaneous us private placement  our october and december common stock offerings  and our may series b preferred stock private placement

the preferred stock is redeemable for cash or common stock at of the fair market value of the common stock as determined in accordance with the certificate of designation of the series b preferred stock in may the million in contractual debt was comprised of million in bonds and million in capital leases on equipment and insurance notes 
of our total debt  million of the outstanding contractual debt was represented by long term debt and million was short term debt outstanding or the current portion of long term debt 
in addition  we have million of non interest bearing short term equipment vendor financings for well servicing rigs and other equipment included in accounts payable 
the million in equipment and insurance notes consisted of million in equipment notes and million in insurance notes related to our general liability  workers compensation and other insurances 
we incurred million for capital equipment acquisitions during the fiscal year as compared to million during the fiscal year this increase in capital expenditures resulted in the addition of equipment during the year ended december   which included frac tanks  heavy trucks  vacuum trucks  well service rigs  coiled tubing spreads  location improvements  and miscellaneous ancillary equipment 
we financed these purchases with cash flow from operations and capital leases and debt under our regions finance facility 
we project that cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve months 
cash flows our cash flows depend  to a large degree  on the level of spending by oil and gas companies development and production activities 
sustained increases or decreases in the price of natural gas or oil could have a material impact on these activities  and could also materially affect our cash flows 
certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  purchases and sales of investments  issuances and repurchases of debt and of our common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the most significant change between the years ended december  and related to an increase in cash flows from a decrease in accounts receivable in the amount of million 
this resulted from collecting our mexico accounts receivable in as we closed the operation and from the slowdown in industry activity in the last half of these changes in cash inflows  related to an increase in collection of accounts receivable  were offset partially by additional cash outflows in the amount of million used to decrease our accounts payable 
as with our accounts receivable change  this accounts payable decrease was consistent with our mexico sale and industry activity moderation 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this million increase resulted from increases in calculated cash flow related to an increase in various non cash items between the periods of million  mainly associated with the extinguishment of the second priority notes  an increase in trade accounts payable of million  and an increase in accrued expenses of million 
these increases in cash flow were offset by cash flow decreases as the result of an increase in net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable between the two periods of million resulting from our increased levels of activity from to as discussed elsewhere herein  a decrease in related party accounts payable of million in the normal course of business  a decrease between the two periods of million in interest payable  an increase in related party accounts receivable of million between and in the normal course of business  and other net increases in cash flow resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million that were in line with normal operating activities 
cash flows used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  amounted to million compared to million from the year ended december   an increase of million

seasonality our operations are impacted by seasonal factors 
historically  our business has been negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather  fewer daylight hours  and holidays 
our well servicing rigs are mobile and we operate a significant number of oilfield vehicles 
during periods of heavy snow  ice or rain  we may not be able to move our equipment between locations  thereby reducing our ability to generate rig or truck hours 
in addition  the majority of our well servicing rigs work only during daylight hours 
in the winter months as daylight time becomes shorter  the amount of time that the well servicing rigs work is shortened  which has a negative impact on total hours worked 
finally  we historically have experienced significant slowdown during the thanksgiving and christmas holiday seasons 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  particularly those related to depreciation and amortization methods  useful lives and impairment of long lived assets  and asset retirement obligations  using currently available information 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimated depreciable lives a substantial portion of our total assets is comprised of equipment 
each asset included in equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  which deducts equal amounts of the cost of such assets from earnings every year over the asset s estimated economic useful life 
as a result of these estimates of economic useful lives  net equipment as of december  totaled million  which represented of total assets 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  totaled million  which represented of total operating expenses 
given the significance of equipment to our financial statements  the determination of an asset s economic useful life is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
the estimated economic useful life is monitored by management to determine its continued appropriateness 
impairments long lived assets  which include property  equipment  and finite lived intangible assets subject to amortization  comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
we review the carrying values of these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts include assumptions related to the rates we bill our customers  equipment utilization  equipment additions  debt borrowings and repayments  staffing levels  pay rates  and other expenses 
in turn  these forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific assets and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
we regularly assess our long lived assets for impairment and in recent years  have concluded that no such impairment write down was necessary 
allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends  including monitoring our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured  as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our customers operate 
inherently  these uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our customers ability to pay amounts due to us in order to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that the customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future 
at december  and  allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million  or  and million  or  of gross accounts receivable  respectively 
the decrease in our allowance for doubtful accounts balance between year end and resulted from the write off  in  of certain accounts receivable against our allowance 
an allowance had been provided against these accounts receivable in prior periods due to concerns regarding collectability 
in  we determined that the accounts were not collectable  and wrote off the account with a corresponding reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover potential bad debt losses under current conditions  however  uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required 
a five percent change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would have had an impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately million in revenue recognition well servicing well servicing consists primarily of maintenance services  workover services  completion services  plugging and abandonment services  and tubing testing 
we price well servicing by the hour of service performed 

table of contents fluid logistics and other fluid logistics and other consists primarily of the sale  transportation  storage  and disposal of fluids used in drilling  production  and maintenance of oil and natural gas wells 
we price fluid logistics by the job  by the hour  or by the quantities sold  disposed  or hauled 
we recognize revenue when services are performed  collection of the relevant receivables is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the price is fixed or determinable 
income taxes our income tax expense on continuing operations was million effective rate on pre tax income of million for the year ended december   compared to an income tax benefit of million effective rate on a pre tax loss of million in for the years ended december  and   and  in state tax expense was recorded and million and million in current foreign income tax expense  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate is due to the state franchise tax  which is calculated from taxable margin and certain non deductible expenses 
as of december  and  million and million in deferred us federal income tax was reflected in the fes ltd 
s balance sheet  respectively 
current and deferred net tax liabilities are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
deferred taxes have not been recognized on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since these amounts are not material 
environmental we are subject to extensive federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws  which are constantly changing  regulate the discharge or release of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the adverse environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum  chemical or other hazardous substances at various sites 
environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on their future economic benefit 
expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future economic benefits are expensed 
liabilities for expenditures of a non capital nature are recorded when environmental assessment and or remediation is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
we believe  on the basis of presently available information  that regulation of known environmental matters will not materially affect our liquidity  capital resources or consolidated financial condition 
however  there can be no assurances that future costs and liabilities will not be material 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 balance sheet asu 
the standard amends and expands disclosure requirements about balance sheet offsetting and related arrangements 
asu becomes effective for the company on january  we do not anticipate any impact to our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity when the guidance becomes effective 
impact of inflation on operations we are of the opinion that inflation has not had a significant impact on our business 
off balance sheet arrangements we are often party to certain transactions that require off balance sheet arrangements such as performance bonds  guarantees  operating leases for equipment  and bank guarantees that are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
these arrangements are made in our normal course of business and they are not reasonably likely to have a current or future material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or cash flows 
prior to january   we had an arrangement in mexico that allowed us to work jointly with a mexican company to service pemex 
in order to complete many of our projects there  the associate company did site preparation work and we did the well service work 
under mutual agreement  we were responsible for of the required performance bond and our associate took of the bond 
historically  forbes performed more than of the work in these projects thereby making 
table of contents this bond arrangement financially viable 
we believe that we accurately reflected this arrangement throughout our financial statements and disclosures  and that there is no other liability to recognize from this arrangement as it was terminated in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we are exposed to financial  market  and economic risks 
changes in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of our financial instruments  interest income  and interest expense 
our financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk are long term borrowings 
the following discussion provides information regarding our exposure to the risks of changing interest rates and fluctuating currency exchange rates 
our primary debt obligations are the outstanding senior notes and any borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our senior notes as such notes bear interest at a fixed rate 
however  changes in interest rates would affect their fair values 
in general  the fair market value of debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall 
conversely  the fair market value of debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
a hypothetical change in interest rates of relative to interest rates as of december  would have no impact on our interest expense for the senior notes 
our revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate and  therefore  is subject to interest rate risk 
as of december   we have not made significant draw on this facility 
for this reason  a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt would not result in significant additional annual interest expense 
with the disposition of our mexican operations in january  we are no longer exposed to any significant foreign currency risk 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk or for speculative purposes
