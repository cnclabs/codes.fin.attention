item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview red robin gourmet burgers  inc  a delaware corporation  together with its subsidiaries red robin or the company  primarily develops  operates and franchises casual dining restaurants with locations as of december   the company fiscal year end 
the company operated company owned restaurants located in states comprised of casual dining locations and five red robin burger works  a smaller non traditional prototype with a limited menu and limited service 
the company also franchises restaurants  of which there were restaurants in states and two canadian provinces as of december  the company operates its business as one operating and one reportable segment 
our primary source of revenue is from the sale of food and beverages at company owned restaurants 
we also earn revenue from royalties and fees from franchised restaurants 
our discussion for the year ending december  refers to a week period with the fifty third week falling in the fourth quarter 
the fiscal years ending december  and december  each had weeks 
the following summarizes the operational and financial highlights of fiscal year impact of fifty third week 
the company fiscal year ends on the last sunday of each calendar year 
most of our fiscal years have weeks  however we experience a fifty third week once every five or six years 
in fiscal  the fifty third week added approximately million to net restaurant sales  million to net income and to diluted earnings per share 
comparable restaurant revenue 
comparable restaurants include those company owned restaurants that have achieved five full quarters of operations during the periods presented  and such restaurants are only included in our comparable metrics if they are comparable for the entirety of both periods presented 
for  the restaurants in our comparable base experienced a increase in net sales compared to the same period last year 
this increase resulted from a increase in average guest check  partially offset by a decrease in guest count 
for purposes of comparison  the calculation of the comparable restaurant net sales and related metrics for was made on a week fiscal year basis by including the first week of the fiscal year in the comparable restaurant performance for marketing 
our red robin royalty loyalty program operates in all of our company owned restaurants and in of our franchised locations 
engaging our guests through this program is a key part of our marketing strategy and uses offers designed to increase the frequency of guest visits 
we are also using the program to generate awareness of new menu items and to engage our guests with smart rewards 
menu items featured included our red tavern double burger with all you can eat bottomless steak fries at the everyday value price of  with popular trade up tavern styles  new shareable appetizers  and special  limited time burgers 
our take back the bar initiative continued to increase year over year alcoholic beverage mix  differentiate our brand  and help target adult diners 
we utilize television  digital and social media campaigns along with other tools to support our marketing programs 
in  we began investing in our brand transformation program to enhance our service  menu  food presentation and other guest experiences 
food costs 
as a percentage of restaurant revenue  cost of sales in remained relatively flat compared to the prior year with decreases in produce  poultry and cheese costs offset by increases in potatoes  ground beef  and fry oil as well as a price increase of approximately 
in particular  the cost of ground beef  which comprised approximately of our cost of goods  increased approximately for  compared to the prior year and we expect ground beef cost will continue to increase throughout in addition  national and international supply demand imbalances and other factors such as continued drought conditions throughout a large portion of the united states  continue to increase certain commodity prices  which we believe will have a negative effect on our costs of sales in labor 
labor costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased basis points for the fiscal year from the same period in this decrease was primarily driven by higher hourly productivity and leverage on higher sales 
many states in which we operate have increased minimum and tip credit wages beginning in we anticipate these wage increases will increase our total labor costs which we may not be able to offset with continued productivity improvements 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses decreased basis points for the fiscal year over prior year as a percentage of restaurant revenue due to a variety of cost management initiatives that were undertaken in this decrease was primarily driven by lower cleaning and supply costs  utilities  and repair and maintenance costs 
new restaurant openings 
we opened new company owned restaurants during fiscal year  including four of our limited service non traditional prototype  red robin burger works 
we plan to open company owned restaurants in  including up to five new red robin burger works restaurants 
refinancing our credit facility 
we closed on a new million credit agreement in december the new credit facility  a five year million revolving line of credit  replaces a facility comprised of a million term loan and million revolving line of credit that was scheduled to mature in may in conjunction with the closing of the credit agreement  we recorded a non cash  pre tax charge of approximately million  comprised of a write off of unamortized fees from the prior credit agreement and a charge related to the de designation of an interest rate swap in the fourth fiscal quarter unit data and comparable restaurant sales the following table details data pertaining to the number of restaurants for both company owned and franchise locations for the years indicated 
company owned beginning of period opened during period acquired from franchisee closed or replaced during period end of period franchised beginning of period opened during period sold  closed or replaced during period end of period total number of restaurants includes four red robin burger works in and one in includes three franchised restaurants that were closed in and re opened during the same year  and two franchised restaurants that were closed in and re opened during the same year 
results of operations operating results for each period presented below are expressed as a percentage of total revenues  except for the components of restaurant operating costs  which are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenues weeks weeks weeks revenues restaurant franchise royalties and fees other revenue total revenues costs and expenses restaurant operating costs exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below cost of sales labor other operating occupancy total restaurant operating costs depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative pre opening costs asset impairment charge income from operations other income expense interest expense  net loss on debt refinancing total other expenses income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income certain percentage amounts in the table above do not total due to rounding as well as the fact that restaurant operating costs are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenues and not total revenues 
total revenues revenues in thousands percent change percent change restaurant revenue franchise royalties and fees other revenue total revenues average weekly net sales volumes in company owned restaurants total operating weeks net sales per square foot in company owned restaurants excludes red robin burger works 
net sales are gross sales net of incentives and discounts  primarily related to our loyalty program 
restaurant revenue  which is comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales  increased by million  or  for the weeks ended december  as compared to the weeks in fiscal year the inclusion of the fifty third week in fiscal contributed approximately million to restaurant revenue 
adjusting for the extra week  revenue in our comparable restaurant base increased approximately million or during primarily as a result of a increase in average guest checks partially offset by decrease in guest counts 
we believe the increase in average guest checks resulted from a combination of menu price increases and increased sales of items including beverages  partially offset by higher discounts including those associated with our red robin royalty loyalty program 
revenue from our non comparable restaurants  those opened since the fourth quarter of fiscal  contributed an increase of million from fiscal year in  restaurant revenue increased million  or  from fiscal year revenue in our comparable restaurant base increased approximately million or during this increase was primarily the result of a increase in average guest checks partially offset by decrease in guest counts 
we believe the average increase in guest checks was driven by a combination of our menu price increases  and the nationwide rollout of our tri fold menu  partially offset by discounts including those associated with our red robin royalty loyalty program 
revenue from our non comparable restaurants  those opened since the fourth quarter of  contributed an increase of approximately million from fiscal year average weekly net sales volumes represent the total restaurant revenue for all company owned casual dining restaurants excluding red robin burger works for each time period presented  divided by the number of operating weeks in the period 
comparable restaurant average weekly sales volumes include those restaurants that are in the comparable base at the end of each period presented 
new restaurants are primarily restaurants that are open but by definition not included in the comparable category because they have not yet operated for five full quarters 
fluctuations in average weekly net sales volumes for comparable restaurants reflect the effect of same store sales changes as well as the performance of new restaurants entering the comparable base during the period and the average square feet of our restaurants 
franchise royalties and fees consist primarily of royalty income and initial franchise fees 
this revenue increased million or  from the year over year increase in franchise royalties and fees is primarily attributable to the overall increase in sales reported by our franchisees 
our franchisees reported that comparable sales increased for us restaurants and for canadian restaurants for the year ended december  franchise royalties and fees for increased over primarily due to an increase in sales reported by our franchisees as they experienced a increase in comparable sales 
other revenue consists primarily of gift card breakage 
we recognize revenue when a gift card is redeemed by a guest 
gift card breakage revenue is recognized if the likelihood of gift card redemption is remote and we determine that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card balance to the relevant jurisdiction 
we base the gift card breakage rate upon specific historical redemption patterns and recognize gift card breakage by applying our estimate of the rate of gift card breakage over the estimated redemption period 
we recognized million of gift card breakage during fiscal year in fiscal year  we recognized million of gift card breakage including  of third party gift card revenue as an initial cumulative program adjustment for gift card sales sold in third party retail locations recognized in the first quarter 
in fiscal  we recognized million of gift card breakage including million of breakage revenue as an initial cumulative program adjustment for gift cards sold in our restaurants recognized in the first quarter 
costs and expenses cost of sales in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change cost of sales as a percent of restaurant revenue cost of sales  comprised of food and beverage costs  is variable and generally fluctuates with sales volume 
cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease as a percentage of restaurant revenue was caused by an estimated basis point decrease in produce  cheese  and poultry costs  which were mostly offset by an basis point increase in the cost of potatoes  ground beef  and fry oil 
cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased basis points in compared to this increase was caused by an estimated basis points net increase in commodity costs  including ground beef  potatoes  cheese and fry oil and a basis point increase related to change in product mix to higher cost menu items 
these increases were partially offset by a basis point decrease due lower poultry and bread costs as well as leverage on higher sales prices 
labor in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change labor as a percent of restaurant revenue labor costs include restaurant level hourly wages and management salaries as well as related taxes and benefits 
in  labor as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased basis points compared to this decrease primarily resulted from basis points of lower costs related to higher hourly productivity  leverage on higher sales as well as a reduction in accrued vacation and payroll taxes 
these reductions were partially offset by basis points of higher costs related primarily to increases in group insurance costs and variable compensation 
during  labor as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased basis points compared to approximately basis points of this decrease was due to the leverage of our higher average guest check on our fixed labor costs  while approximately basis points decrease was due to increased productivity and lower average hourly wage rates 
these decreases were offset by an approximate basis point increase in payroll taxes related to the elimination of the hiring incentives to restore employment act in for payroll tax benefits realized in other operating in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change other operating as a percent of restaurant revenue other operating costs include costs such as restaurant supplies  utilities  and other costs such as service repairs and maintenance costs 
during  other operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased basis points over the prior year due primarily to a basis point decrease in cleaning and supply costs due to cost management efforts  a basis point decrease in utilities and repair and maintenance costs  and a basis point decrease in payment card processing fees resulting from legislative changes 
during  other operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased basis points from the decrease as a percentage of restaurant revenue was due primarily to a combination of basis points leverage from higher restaurant revenue  basis points decrease in repairs and maintenance costs  and basis points decrease in costs of supplies related to initiatives to reduce expenses through better cost management 
occupancy in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change occupancy as a percent of restaurant revenue occupancy costs include fixed rents  contingent rents  common area maintenance charges  real estate and personal property taxes  general liability insurance  and other property costs 
occupancy costs incurred prior to opening our new restaurants are included in pre opening costs 
our occupancy costs generally increase with increases in sales volume from contingent rents or the addition of new restaurants  but can decline as a percentage of restaurant revenue as we leverage our fixed costs 
in  occupancy costs as a percent of restaurant revenue increased basis points over the prior year due mainly to higher fixed rents due mainly to the opening of new restaurants in addition to approximately million related to the fifty third week included in fiscal year fixed rents in were million 
in  occupancy costs as a percent of restaurant revenue decreased basis points 
fixed rents for the fiscal year ended and were million and million  respectively  and increased due to the opening of new restaurants 
the decrease of occupancy costs as a percent of restaurant revenue related mainly to the leveraging of fixed costs on higher revenue 
depreciation and amortization in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change depreciation and amortization as a percent of total revenues depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants and corporate assets as well as amortization of acquired franchise rights and liquor licenses 
depreciation and amortization expense remained relatively flat in as compared to as the increases related to new restaurant openings were mostly offset by assets that became fully depreciated during the current year 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue for fiscal year  decreased due to leverage from higher restaurant sales volumes 
in  depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or due  in part  by five year depreciable equipment for restaurants which were open in becoming fully depreciated 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year due primarily to leverage from higher restaurant sales volumes

components of this category include corporate  regional and franchise support salaries and benefits  travel  information systems  training  office rent  professional and consulting fees  board of directors expenses  legal expenses and marketing costs 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative costs increased million from primarily due to million higher gift card fees and production costs  million higher salaries and benefits partially due to the extra week in fiscal  and million higher consulting fees associated with information technology infrastructure changes 
selling  general and administrative costs in increased million from due to a million increase in accrued performance based compensation  million in expenses related to information technology infrastructure investments and million increase in legal expenses 
our marketing costs remained flat compared to pre opening costs in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change pre opening costs as a percent of total revenues average per restaurant pre opening costs pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of labor  hiring  and training the initial work force for our new restaurants  travel expenses for our training teams  the cost of food and beverages used in training  marketing costs  occupancy costs incurred prior to opening  and other direct costs related to the opening of new restaurants 
pre opening costs for   and reflect the opening of   and new restaurants  respectively 
average per restaurant pre opening costs represents total costs incurred for those restaurants that opened for business during the periods presented including red robin burger works restaurants 
the fiscal average per restaurant pre opening costs decreased over fiscal due primarily to the inclusion of four red robin burger works restaurants which were opened in fiscal pre opening costs for these smaller scale restaurants are lower than the pre opening costs for our traditional size restaurants 
asset impairment charge and restaurant closure costs during fiscal year  the company determined that no company owned restaurants were impaired 
during fiscal year  the company determined that three company owned restaurants were impaired  recognizing a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million 
during fiscal year  the company determined that four company owned restaurants were impaired  and the company recognized a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million resulting from the continuing and projected losses of these restaurants 
the company reviewed each restaurant past and present operating performance combined with projected future results  primarily through projected undiscounted cash flows  which indicated impairment 
the carrying amount of each restaurant was compared to its fair value as determined by management 
the impairment charge represents the excess of each restaurant carrying amount over its fair value 
we closed three  zero  and three restaurants in fiscal   and  respectively 
we recognized charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal related to lease terminations and other closing related costs 
the three closed restaurants in were not part of the impairment charge taken in fiscal interest expense interest expense in   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
interest expense was lower in than due to a lower average debt balance  partially offset by a higher weighted average interest rate of versus in interest expense in was higher than due primarily to a higher weighted average interest rate of versus in loss on debt refinancing on december   we entered into a new credit facility new credit facility thereby terminating our previous credit facility  which had been amended and restated on may  previous facility 
see liquidity and capital resources  credit facility for further discussion 
due to the debt refinancing  we re designated our variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement which was used to hedge the floating interest rate on a portion of the outstanding term loan under the previous facility 
the company recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million as a result of the de designation to recognize net losses that had been previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we also recognized a non cash pre tax charge of million to write off certain unamortized loan origination costs associated with the previous facility 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million to million in as compared to million in and a tax benefit of million in our effective income tax rate was in  for  and a benefit for the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal is primarily attributable to the increase in earnings before income taxes as well as a decrease in general business tax credits 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the increase in earnings before income taxes 
we would expect to see volatility in our tax rate given changes in income before taxes and income tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources general cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december   from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this decrease in our cash position was primarily the net result of million used for debt payments  million used for the construction of new restaurants  expenditures for facility improvements  and investments in information technology  million used for the purchase of company stock  and million used for the acquisition of a franchise restaurant  partially offset by million provided by borrowings under the new credit facility  and million of cash provided by operating activities 
we expect to continue to reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants or invest in existing restaurants and infrastructure  pay down debt  and maintain the flexibility to use excess cash to opportunistically repurchase our common stock and execute our long term strategic initiatives 
cash flows the table below summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years in thousands year ended december  december  december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating cash flows net cash flows provided by operating activities were million in compared to million in the million decrease over prior year is primarily due to increases in selling  general and administrative costs  a higher rate of redemptions relative to cash receipts from gift cards and incentive programs  and cash payments for income taxes  which more than offset million of increases in cash flow related to improved restaurant operating costs  sales increases from new and existing restaurants and the addition of a fifty third operating week in net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in as compared to million in of the million increase  approximately million was related to a reduction in restaurant operating costs  primarily attributable to labor efficiencies  and approximately million was due mainly to newly opened restaurants  partially offset by million from restaurants closed during investing cash flows net cash flows used in investing activities increased million from million in to million in the increase over prior year is due primarily to increased investments in brand transformation initiatives  technology infrastructure  and million paid to acquire a franchise restaurant in the following table lists the components of our investing activities for fiscal in millions year ended december  new and acquired restaurants investments in technology infrastructure restaurant facility improvements other net cash used in investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in and consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
the million increase in primarily related to restaurant openings in compared to openings in  as well as increased investments in technology infrastructure 
investing cash flows included million and million in capital expenditures in and  respectively 
in fiscal year  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately to million though this amount may increase if we determine to expand the number of restaurant remodels 
in addition to the construction of new restaurants  we will continue our investment in restaurant remodels and capital improvements 
we will also make significant investments in our data infrastructure including the replacement of several key operational and financial systems 
financing cash flows cash used in our financing activities increased million from million in to million in this increase is due primarily to a million increase in net debt payments partially offset by million decrease in cash used to repurchase stock  million decrease in cash used to refinance our credit facility in  and million increase in cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
net cash flows used in financing activities were million in compared to million in the million decrease in cash used in financing activities primarily relates to a million decrease in net debt payments combined with an increase of million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan  mostly offset by million in repurchases of stock and million of debt issuance costs related to our refinancing 
credit facility 
we entered into our previous facility on may  in order to provide a more flexible capital structure and facilitate our growth plans 
borrowings under the previous facility could be used by us for general corporate purposes including  among other uses  to repurchase shares of our capital stock  to continue to finance restaurant construction  and for working capital and general corporate requirements 
the previous facility was comprised of i a million revolving credit facility maturing on may  and ii a million term loan maturing on may   both with rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread based on leverage or a base rate plus a spread based on leverage base rate is the highest of a the prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus and c libor for an interest period of one month plus 
the previous facility also allowed us  subject to lender participation  to increase the revolving credit facility or term loan by up to an additional million in the future 
as part of the previous facility  we could request the issuance of up to million in letters of credit  the outstanding amount of which reduces the net borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
the previous facility required the payment of an annual commitment fee based upon the unused portion of the credit facility 
the previous facility interest rates and the annual commitment rate were based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
our obligations under the previous facility were secured by first priority liens and security interests in substantially all of our assets  which included the capital stock of our certain subsidiaries 
additionally  the previous facility included a negative pledge on all tangible and intangible assets including all real and personal property with customary exceptions 
on december   we terminated the previous facility and entered into a new credit facility new credit facility with a consortium of banks 
the new credit facility provides for a million revolving line of credit with a sublimit for the issuance of up to million in letters of credits and swingline loans up to million  and maintains the option to increase this credit facility in the future  subject to lenders participation  by up to an additional million in the aggregate 
borrowings under the new credit facility are subject to rates based on libor plus a spread based on leverage or a base rate plus a spread based on leverage base rate is the highest of a the prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus and c libor for an interest period of one month plus 
this million revolving line of credit matures on december  borrowings under the new credit facility are secured by first priority liens and security interests in substantially all of our assets  which include the capital stock of our certain subsidiaries  and are available for financing activities including restaurant construction costs  working capital and general corporate purposes  including  among other uses  to refinance certain indebtedness  permitted acquisitions and redemption of capital stock 
we do not believe that any of our lenders will not be able to fulfill their lending commitments under our new credit facility 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings under the new credit facility revolver of million 
proceeds from the new credit facility were used to repay the million outstanding balance of the term loan of the previous facility and to pay related transaction fees and expenses associated with the refinancing of debt 
loan origination costs associated with the new credit facility are included as deferred costs in other assets  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  in august  we entered into a variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement with rabobank international  utrecht rabobank to hedge the floating interest rate on a portion of the term loan under our previous facility 
the interest rate swap had an effective date of august  and an initial notional amount of million 
in accordance with its original terms million and million of the initial million expired in and respectively 
the remaining notional amount of million decreases quarterly and is set to expire on june  with a notional hedge amount of million 
under the swap  we are required to make quarterly payments based on a fixed interest rate of  calculated based on the remaining notional amount 
in exchange  we receive interest on the notional amount at a variable rate that is based on the month spot libor rate quarterly 
concurrent with the december  refinancing of the loan agreement that was designated as being hedged by this swap  the company de designated the original hedging relationship for this swap and consequently reclassified all deferred gains and losses that had been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss  a non cash pre tax charge of million  into earnings 
on december   the company re designated the swap on the new credit facility million revolver 
covenants 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our new credit facility  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  stock repurchases  sales of assets  and dividend payments 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
debt outstanding 
total debt outstanding decreased million to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to our net repayment of the million outstanding under our previous facility and new credit facility  as well as payments on our capital lease obligations of approximately million 
our new credit facility matures in stock repurchase 
in august  the company board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to million of the company common stock which was scheduled to expire on december  on october   the company board of directors re authorized a repurchase of up to million of the company common stock 
this authorization expired on december  in fiscal  we repurchased  shares with an average purchase price of per share for a total of million 
in fiscal  we repurchased million shares with an average purchase price of per share for a total of million 
on november   the company board of directors re authorized a repurchase of up to million of the company common stock 
this authorization became effective on january   and will terminate upon completing the repurchase of million of common stock unless earlier terminated by the company board of directors 
purchases may be made from time to time at the company discretion and the timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined based on share price  market conditions  legal requirements and other factors 
the repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock  and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total and thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities total contractual obligations long term debt obligations represent minimum required principal payments under our credit agreement including estimated interest of million based on a average borrowing interest rate 
capital lease obligations include interest of million 
operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease commitments payable for land  buildings  and equipment used in our operations 
this table excludes contingent rents  including amounts which are determined as a percentage of adjusted sales in excess of specified levels 
purchase obligations include commitments for the construction of new restaurants and other capital improvement projects and lease commitments for company owned restaurants where leases have been executed but construction has not begun 
it also includes the company share of system wide commitments for beverage and supply items 
these amounts require estimates and could vary due to the timing of volumes 
excluded are any agreements that are cancelable without significant penalty 
other non current liabilities include executive deferred compensation  uncertain tax positions  and vendor deposits 
financial condition and future liquidity 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  support for infrastructure needs  and for general operating purposes 
in addition  we have and may continue to use capital to pay principal on our borrowings and repurchase our common stock 
our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we and the restaurant industry in general maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors generally grant short term trade credit for purchases  such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new restaurants and refurbishment of existing restaurants  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of our current assets which results in a working capital deficit 
we are able to operate with a working capital deficit because restaurant sales are primarily conducted on a cash or credit card basis 
rapid turnover of inventory results in limited investment in inventories  and cash from sales is usually received before related payables for food  supplies and payroll become due 
in addition  receipts from the sale of gift cards are received well in advance of related redemptions 
rather than maintain higher cash balances that would result from this pattern of operating cash flows  we typically utilize operating cash flows in excess of those required for currently maturing liabilities to pay for capital expenditures  debt repayment or to repurchase stock 
when necessary  we utilize our revolving credit facility to satisfy short term liquidity requirements 
however  we believe that our future cash flows will be sufficient to satisfy any working capital deficits 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor costs  energy costs  and materials used in the construction of new restaurants 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage have directly affected our labor costs in recent years 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation had a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in fiscal year  due primarily to higher costs for certain supplies  and commodity prices for certain foods we purchased at market rates 
our ground beef  which is purchased on the spot market  has consistently been higher than prices  our ground beef costs were approximately higher than uncertainties related to fluctuations in costs  including energy costs  commodity prices  annual indexed wage increases and construction materials make it difficult to predict what impact  if any  inflation may have on our business during  but it is anticipated that inflation will continue to have a negative impact in fiscal year seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality 
accordingly  results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year  and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the following as the company most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company financial condition and results and require management most subjective and complex judgment 
information regarding the company other significant accounting policies is disclosed in note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  including restaurant sites  leasehold improvements  other fixed assets  and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed when indicators of impairment are present 
expected cash flows associated with an asset are the key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset 
identifiable cash flows are measured at the restaurant level 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  including assumptions on future revenue trends 
management estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes to our business model  or changes in operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
during fiscal  the company determined that no company owned restaurants were impaired 
during  we determined that three company owned restaurants were impaired 
we recognized a non cash pre tax impairment charge of million resulting from the continuing and projected future results of these restaurants  primarily through projected cash flows 
we reviewed each restaurant past and present operating performance combined with projected future results  primarily through projected undiscounted cash flows  which indicated possible impairment 
we compared the carrying amount of each restaurant assets to its fair value as estimated by management 
the fair value of the long lived assets was determined using a discounted cash flows projection model that uses several scenarios that estimate expected future cash flows 
the discount factor was determined using external information regarding the risk free rate of return  industry beta factors  and premium adjustments 
these factors were combined with internal information such as our average cost of debt and effective tax rate to determine a weighted average cost of capital which was applied to the undiscounted cash flows 
the impairment charges represent the excess of each restaurant carrying amount over its estimated fair value 
during  we determined that the long lived assets of four company owned restaurants were impaired  and we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million resulting from the continuing and projected losses of these restaurants 
we may record future impairments for restaurants whose operating performance falls below current expectations 
we have followed a consistent approach to evaluating whether there are impairments of long lived assets 
we make adjustments to assumptions to reflect management view of current market and economic conditions and with respect to conditions at specific locations 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
we performed step one of the impairment test as of december  step one of the impairment test is based upon a comparison of the carrying value of our net assets  including goodwill balances  to the fair value of our net assets 
fair value is measured using a combination of the market capitalization method  the income approach  and the market approach 
the market capitalization method uses the company stock price to derive fair value 
the income approach consists of utilizing the discounted cash flow method that incorporates our estimates of future revenues and costs  discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate 
our estimates used in the income approach are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage operations 
the market approach utilizes multiples of profit measures in order to estimate the fair value of the assets 
we do evaluate all methods to ensure reasonably consistent results 
additionally  we evaluate the key input factors in the models used to determine whether a moderate change in any input factor or combination of factors would significantly change the results of the tests 
based on the completion of the step one test  we determined that goodwill was not impaired as of december   as the percentage by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value was approximately 
however  an impairment charge may be triggered in the future  if the value of our stock declines  sales in our restaurants decline  or if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment of the restaurant industry 
we have followed a consistent approach to evaluating whether there are impairments of goodwill 
the company makes adjustments to assumptions to reflect management view of current market and economic conditions 
lease accounting 
under the provisions of certain of our leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of rent holidays and escalations are reflected in rent costs on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we will exercise such option periods due to the fact that we would incur an economic penalty for not doing so 
the lease term commences on the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments which coincides with the time when the landlord delivers the property for us to develop and we waive contract contingencies 
all rent costs recognized during construction periods are expensed immediately as pre opening expenses 
judgments made by management for its lease obligations include the probable term for each lease that affects the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holidays and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent  incremental borrowing rates  and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
we have not made any changes to the nature of the assumptions used to account for leases in the past three years 
insurance self insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for a portion of losses related to group health insurance  general liability and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
the self insurance liability represents an estimate of the cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial based estimates  as well as incurred but not reported claims  and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater number of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or should medical costs or other claim costs increase beyond what was expected  our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient  and additional expenses may be recorded 
actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated  resulting in expense reductions 
unanticipated changes in our estimates may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported historically under these programs 
we have not made any significant changes to the nature of the assumptions used to account our self insurance liabilities in the past three years 
income taxes 
the determination of the company provision for income taxes requires management judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 
the company establishes contingency reserves for material  known tax exposures relating to deductions  transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item 
the company reserves reflect its judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review 
several years may elapse before a particular matter  for which the company has established a reserve  is audited and finally resolved or clarified 
while the company believes that its reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related reserve 
such differences could materially increase or decrease the company income tax provision in the current and or future periods 
when facts and circumstances change including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration  these reserves are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change 
to the extent the company determines that it will not realize the benefit of some or all of its deferred tax assets  then these assets will be adjusted through the company provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made 
unearned revenues 
unearned revenues represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed  as well as  deferred revenues related to our loyalty program 
we recognize sales when the gift card is redeemed by the customer 
although there are no expiration dates or dormancy fees for our gift cards  based on our historical gift card redemption patterns  we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote  which is referred to as breakage 
we recognize breakage within other revenue for unused gift card amounts in proportion to actual gift card redemptions  which is also referred to as the redemption recognition method 
the estimated value of gift cards expected to go unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed 
utilizing this method  we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption 
if actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates  actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded 
we update our estimate of our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions 
in january  we began rolling out our red robin royalty loyalty program in all company owned restaurants 
under the terms of the program  a registered member receives an award for a free entr e after the purchase of nine qualifying entr es 
we recognize the current sale of an entr e and defer a portion of the revenue to reflect partial pre payment for the future entr e the member is entitled to receive 
we estimate the future value of the award based on the historical average value of redemptions 
we also estimate what portion of registered members are not likely to reach the ninth purchase based on historical activity and recognize the deferred revenue related to those purchases 
we recognize the deferred revenue on earned rewards when redeemed or upon expiration  which is days after the award is earned 
we compare the estimate of the value of future awards to historical redemptions to evaluate the reasonableness of the deferred amount stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions  under which we recognize stock based compensation using the black scholes or monte carlo for performance based units option pricing model and recognize expense on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service periods of an option 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards require the input of highly subjective and judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we have not made any changes to the nature of the assumptions used to account for stock based compensation in the past three years  other than an increase in the forfeiture rate we apply to officer grants  due to the recent officer transitions 
during  the company granted performance based restricted stock units psus to executives and other key employees 
these psus contain a market condition based on total shareholder return and measure the overall stock price performance of the company to the stock price performance of a selected industry peer group 
the actual number of psus subject to the awards will be determined at the end of the performance period based on these performance metrics 
the fair value of the psus was calculated using the monte carlo valuation method 
this method utilizes multiple input variables to determine the probability of the company achieving the market condition and the fair value of the awards 
this method uses judgment and estimation which is the responsibility of management 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases primarily restaurant leases entered into the normal course of business  we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this pronouncement was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the new guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
we adopted this pronouncement in the first quarter of the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june and as updated in december  the fasb updated its guidance regarding comprehensive income to require companies to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the updated guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in equity 
this guidance was adopted retrospectively in the first quarter of and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment and permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance was adopted in the first quarter of and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
newly issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued intangibles testing indefinite lived intangibles for impairment  which modifies the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets 
under the new guidance  an entity is permitted to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that the indefinite lived intangible asset fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the quantitative impairment calculations would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
the guidance is effective for impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after september   however  earlier adoption is allowed 
as the guidance does not change the underlying principle that the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset should not exceed its fair value  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which clarifies the scope of transactions that are subject to the disclosures about offsetting and will require disclosure of information about the effect or potential effect of financial instrument netting arrangements on financial position 
entities will be required to present both net offset amounts and gross information in the notes to the financial statements for relevant assets and liabilities that are offset 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   however  earlier adoption is allowed 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under our new credit facility  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings  which bear interest at one of the following rates we select an alternate base rate abr  based on the prime rate plus to  or the london interbank offered rate libor  based on the relevant one  three or six month libor  at our discretion  plus to 
the spread  or margin  for abr and libor loans under the new credit facility is subject to quarterly adjustment based on our then current leverage ratio  as defined by the credit agreement 
as of december   we had million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates 
a change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre tax interest expense fluctuation of million on an annualized basis 
our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we have used an interest rate swap and may use other means such as caps to manage our net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings 
as appropriate  on the date derivative contracts are entered into  we designate derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
in august  we entered into a variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement with rabobank international  utrecht rabobank to hedge the floating interest rate on a portion of the term loan under our previous facility 
the interest rate swap had an effective date of august  and an initial notional amount of million 
in accordance with its original terms million and million of the initial million expired in and respectively 
the remaining notional amount of million decreases quarterly and is set to expire on june  with a notional hedge amount of million 
under the swap  we are required to make quarterly payments based on a fixed interest rate of  calculated based on the remaining notional amount 
in exchange  we receive interest on the notional amount at a variable rate that is based on the month spot libor rate quarterly 
concurrent with the december  refinancing of the loan agreement that was designated as being hedged by this swap  the company de designated the original hedging relationship for this swap and consequently reclassified all deferred gains and losses that had been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss  a non cash pre tax charge of million  into earnings 
on december   the company re designated the swap on the new credit facility million revolver 
refer to note  derivative and other comprehensive income  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this report 
primarily all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in united states dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to significant foreign currency risk 
many of the food products we purchase are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality  and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to mitigate some of this risk  we have entered into fixed price agreements on some of our food and beverage products  including certain proteins  produce and cooking oil 
as of the end of fiscal year  approximately of our estimated annual food and beverage purchases were covered by fixed price contracts  most of which are scheduled to expire at various times during fiscal year these contracts may exclude related expenses such as fuel surcharges and other fees 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to reduce or mitigate these risks
