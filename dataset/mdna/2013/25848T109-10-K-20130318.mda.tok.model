the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  manufacture and market a range of software and hardware storage systems for the entry and midrange storage markets 
we focus on selling through server based original equipment manufacturers oems  such as hewlett packard  or hp  dell inc or dell  lenovo group limited or lenovo  advanced micro devices  inc or amd  stratus technologies or stratus and wipro limited or wipro  as well as into vertical markets  which primarily include media and entertainment  telecommunications  hpc digital image archive  big data and oil and gas 
our vertical market customers are oems  who embed our products into their solutions  as well as resellers 
typical customers for our storage systems products  which include our assuredsan line of storage array products  include organizations requiring high reliability  high performance networked or direct attached storage and data management solutions in an open systems architecture 
our storage solutions consist of integrated hardware  firmware and software products employing a modular system that allows end users to add various protocol  performance  capacity or data protection schemes as needed 
our broad range of products  from small capacity direct attached to complete multi hundred terabyte  or tb  storage area networks  or sans  provide end users with a cost effective means of addressing increasing storage demands at compelling price performance points 
our current product family based on our assuredsan architecture provides high performance and large disk array capacities for a broad variety of environments  employing fibre channel  internet small computer systems interface  or iscsi or serial attached scsi  or sas  interconnects to switches and or hosts 
in addition  our assured family of data protection software products provides additional layers of data protection options to complement our line of storage disk arrays 
our current mainstream assuredsan tm and series of entry level storage products and just a bunch of disks  or jbod  arrays are targeted primarily at mainstream enterprise and small to medium business  or smb  applications 
some of our assuredsan products have been distinguished by certification as network equipment building system  or nebs  level a telecommunications standard for equipment used in central offices and are mil std f a military standard created by the us government compliant based on their ruggedness and reliability 
in february  we launched the latest assuredsan series of storage arrays that provide high speed interface options including gigabyte  or gb  fibre channel  gb and gb iscsi over ethernet and gb sas connectivity 
on august   we introduced assuredsan tm pro series with realstor tm software that incorporates autonomic real time data tiering via a virtualized back end 
with realstor  businesses gain the advantage of very high performance ssds  using them to their maximum benefit  while storing less frequently accessed data on slower  but much less expensive hard disk drives 
on the same day  we also introduced our assuredsan tm series next generation  high performance storage solution designed to deliver best in class price performance  percent availability  and exceptional 
table of contents streaming throughput 
the series shares the same architecture as the pro series 
our series and products are characterized by idc as band and band products 
with the announcement of our series and products  we now have products characterized within idc price bands and products and we have thus increased our total available market as measured by end user sales price from billion to billion 
our agreements with our customers do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and may be terminated at any time upon notice from the applicable customer 
our ability to achieve and maintain profitability will depend on  among other things  the level and mix of orders we actually receive from such customers  the actual amounts we spend on marketing support  the actual amounts we spend for inventory support and incremental internal investment  our ability to reduce product cost  our product lead time  our ability to meet delivery schedules required by our customers and the economic environment 
our products and services are sold worldwide to facilitate server and san storage implementations  primarily through server based oems  vertical markets partners that include embedded oems that integrate our products into their solutions  and vars 
our storage system products server based oem partners currently include  among others  hewlett packard  or hp  lenovo and stratus  who purchase our assuredsan products  and dell and amd  who purchase our assuredvra products 
our vertical markets partners include motorola  inc  or motorola  tektronix inc  or tektronix  samsung electronics  or samsung  concurrent computer corporation  or concurrent  autodesk inc or autodesk  harris broadcast communications and nokia siemens network  or nokia siemens 
although our products and services are sold worldwide  the majority of our net revenue is derived from our us operations 
we began shipping products to hp in the fourth quarter of in january  we amended our agreement with hp to allow for sales of additional products to additional divisions within hp 
our products are primarily sold as hp s msa p product family 
sales to hp increased significantly during and increased again in primarily as a result of the successful launch and market acceptance of the hp msa products 
hp launched its third generation product line  now called the p product line  in february sales to hp increased again in as we began selling our next generation host interfaces across the hp p product line 
the agreement with hp does not contain any minimum purchase commitments 
in october  we extended our supply agreement with hp by five years to expire in october and also extended the expiration of million warrants granted to hp in march to expire concurrently with the supply agreement in october net revenue from hp approximated of our total net revenue in we expect sales to hp to continue to represent a substantial percentage of our total net revenue in we expect to generate additional revenue from our indirect channel as well as new and potential new oem customers 
in addition  the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our ability to maintain and enhance relationships with our customers  in particular our oem customers  as well as our ability to win new business  our ability to source critical components such as integrated circuits  hard disk drives  memory and other components on a timely basis  the amount of field failures resulting in product replacements or recalls  our ability to launch new products in accordance with oem specifications  schedules and milestones  our ability to sell dot hill branded products through resellers  our ability to win new server based oem customers and oems who embed our products into their solutions  general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continuing volatility in the technology sector  current general economic volatility and trends in the data storage markets in various geographic regions  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  and the inability of certain of our customers who depend on credit to have access to their traditional sources of credit to finance the purchase of products from us  particularly in the current global economic environment  which may lead them to reduce their level of purchases or to seek credit or other accommodations from us 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 

table of contents our manufacturing strategy includes outsourcing substantially all of our manufacturing to third party manufacturers in order to reduce sales cycle times and manufacturing infrastructure  enhance working capital and improve margins by taking advantage of the third parties manufacturing and procurement economies of scale 
in september  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with foxconn technology group  or foxconn 
under the terms of the agreement  foxconn supplies us with manufacturing  assembly and test services from its facilities in china and final integration services including final assembly  testing and configure to order services through its worldwide facilities 
in november  we amended our agreement with foxconn to extend the manufacturing agreement for a period of three years 
in addition  foxconn agreed to waive the requirement for a letter of credit and improved our payment terms 
the majority of our products sold in   and were manufactured by foxconn 
we expect foxconn to manufacture substantially all of our products in we derive the majority of our net revenue primarily from sales of our series and family of products  which are included in our assuredsan product line 
cost of goods sold includes costs of materials  subcontractor costs  salary and related benefits for the production and service departments  depreciation and amortization of equipment and intangible assets used in the production and service departments  production facility rent and allocation of overhead as well as manufacturing variances and freight 
research and development expenses consist primarily of project related expenses  consulting charges and salaries for employees directly engaged in research and development 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  marketing related costs  advertising  customer related evaluation unit expenses  promotional costs and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation to officers and employees performing administrative functions  as well as expenditures for legal  accounting and other administrative services and fluctuations in currency valuations 
other income expense  net is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
in the first quarter of  our management approved  committed to  and initiated a restructuring and cost reduction plan  or the plan  that is associated with the closure of our israel technology development center 
the plan is designed to re align our software investments to focus on accelerating the development of embedded software features  in order to launch a competitive set of mid range storage array products in  and to provide more differentiated entry level products for both oem and channel customers 
substantially all of our plan workforce reductions were completed by july  the closure of our israel technology development center is now recorded in discontinued operations  since we have ceased all ongoing operational activities as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on current facts  historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results  future results of operations will be affected 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
we have many accounting policies that require us to make estimates and assumptions  the determination of useful lives of long lived assets  warranty reserves  accruals for estimated restructuring  tax and legal liabilities and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the items listed below are not inclusive of all of our accounting policies but is a listing  identified by management  of those policies which require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from sales of our hardware products  software and services 

table of contents hardware hardware product revenue consists of revenue from sales of our assuredsan storage systems which is integrated with industry standard hardware which is essential to the functionality of the integrated system product 
we recognize hardware product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized for hardware product sales upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer and in addition  upon installation for certain of our assureduvs appliance products 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other factors known at the time 
if actual future returns and pricing adjustments differ from past experience and our estimates  additional revenue reserves may be required 
software in accordance with the specific guidance for recognizing software revenue  where applicable  we recognize revenue from perpetual software licenses at the inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we use the relative method to allocate revenue to software licenses at the inception of the license term when vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for all unspecified software updates and enhancements related to our products through service contracts is available 
we have established vsoe for the fair value of our support services as measured by the stated renewal prices paid by our customers when the services are sold separately on a standalone basis 
specific long term software contracts may contain multiple deliverables including software licenses  services  training and post contract support for which we have not established vsoe of fair value of any of the elements 
under specific guidance for recognizing software revenue  we begin recognizing revenue upon the delivery of all the elements except post contract support pcs 
we defer all the direct and incremental costs related to the deliverables in these contracts until delivery of all the elements except pcs 
the deferred revenue and costs are amortized over the contractual pcs support periods 
during the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the accounting analysis for the renewal of a long term software contract  the company determined that it had applied an inappropriate revenue recognition methodology in and to the contract 
the company recorded revenue as royalty payments were received on this contract and should have deferred all the revenue and direct and incremental costs until all the deliverables  except pcs  were delivered in this resulted in an overstatement of million of revenue and million of costs in  and an overstatement of million of revenue and million of costs in this was corrected in the fourth quarter of  and the net out of period impact of these adjustments was million  consisting of a reduction of revenue and research and development costs of million and million  respectively 
service our service revenue primarily includes out of warranty repairs and product maintenance contracts 
out of warranty repairs primarily consist of product repair services performed by our contract manufacturers for those customers that allowed their original product warranty to expire without purchasing one of our higher level support service plans 
revenue from these out of warranty repairs  and the associated cost of sales  is recognized in the period these services are provided 
service revenue also consists of product maintenance contracts purchased by our customers as an extension of our standard warranty 
revenue from our product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally to months 
net revenue derived from services was less than of total revenue for all periods presented 
revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables for multi element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product s functionality  undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product s essential software  and undelivered non software services  we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  we use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vsoe of fair value  ii third party evidence of selling price  or tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price  or esp 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and represents the actual price charged by us for that deliverable 
esps reflect our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 
from time to time  we enter into arrangements with customers that include acceptance criteria 
in such instances  we defer all revenue on the arrangement until customer acceptance is obtained or the acceptance clause lapses 
revenue recognition for sales to channel partners 
table of contents on sales to channel partners  we evaluate whether fees are considered fixed or determinable by considering a number of factors  including our ability to estimate returns  payment terms and our relationship and past history with the particular channel partner 
if fees are not considered fixed or determinable at the time of sale to a channel partner  revenue recognition is deferred until there is persuasive evidence indicating the product has sold through to an end user 
persuasive evidence of sell through may include reports from channel partners documenting sell through activity or data indicating an order has shipped to an end user 
deferred revenue we defer revenue on upfront nonrefundable payments from our customers and recognize it ratably over the term of the agreement  unless the payment is in exchange for products delivered that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process 
when we provide consideration to a customer  we recognize the value of that consideration as a reduction in net revenue 
we may be required to maintain inventory with certain of our largest oem customers  which we refer to as hubbing arrangements 
pursuant to these arrangements we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products 
warranty and related obligations our standard warranty provides that if our systems do not function to published specifications  we will repair or replace the defective component or system without charge generally for a period of approximately three years 
we generally extend to our customers the warranties provided to us by our suppliers  and accordingly  the majority of our warranty obligations to customers are typically intended to be covered by corresponding supplier warranties 
for warranty costs not covered by our suppliers  we provide for estimated warranty costs in the period the revenue is recognized 
there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to provide such warranties to us in the future or that our warranty obligations to our customers will be covered by corresponding warranties from our suppliers  the absence of which could have a material effect on our financial statements 
estimated liabilities for product warranties are included in accrued expenses 
in october  we discovered a quality issue associated with certain power supply devices provided by a long term component supplier  which resulted in a higher than expected level of power supply failures to us and our customers 
while we were able to promptly identify and resolve the cause of the failures  we are required to provide replacement products or make repairs to the affected power supply units that had been sold between march and october through june   our component supplier had repaired all of the faulty power supplies at no cost to us and reimbursed us for our out of pocket costs  which has constituted a reimbursement to customers for certain out of pocket costs they incurred in connection with these power supply failures 
the total amount reimbursed to us by our component supplier approximated million through june  in the second and third quarters of  a material customer provided us with a framework estimating the potential claims precipitated by the power supply failures 
as previously disclosed  the customer s preliminary framework of potential claims provided to us included additional costs related to the customer s internal overhead for other internal indirect costs  in addition to third party direct costs 
based on preliminary discussions for settlement and our analysis of the framework provided by the customer  including future potential claims through the warranty period  we estimated that we had incurred a probable loss of approximately million 
consequently  in addition to the million previously recognized as of june   we recorded an estimated liability of million as of september  within accrued expenses on our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
negotiations continued with our customer throughout the fourth quarter of into the first half of based on the results of ongoing negotiations with the material customer  we increased our estimated liability at december  to million  resulting in a charge of million during the fourth quarter of within accrued expenses on our condensed consolidated balance sheet  gross of any third party recoveries 
a final settlement with this material customer was reached during the second quarter of the terms of the agreement required an immediate payment of million and an estimated remaining liability of approximately million as of december   a portion of which relates to future price concessions and rebates based on sales volumes through december  the remaining portion relates to costs for extension of warranty coverage on these units 
while our estimated liability relating to failed power supply units is subject to some uncertainty  based on our current expectation of sales volumes with this material customer  we do not believe the incurrence of an additional loss is either probable or reasonably possible at this time 
during the second quarter of  based on the advice of legal counsel  we established that our component supplier is contractually obligated to reimburse us for fair and reasonable costs we incur with our customers associated with these power supply failures 
our component supplier had continued to re work and distribute to our customer the affected population of 
table of contents power supplies at no cost to us 
in addition  at the time  our collection experience with similar amounts already reimbursed to us by our supplier and our belief that our component supplier and its parent companies had the financial ability to continue to reimburse us for any additional costs we may incur  we recorded a current asset within prepaid expenses and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet of million as of june  during the third quarter of  as the claims from our customer became clearer  we commenced negotiations with our component supplier for fair and reasonable costs that we have and are likely to incur through the warranty period associated with this component failure 
originally we determined that the supplier was unlikely to make an up front cash payment for the original settlement amount of million  but it indicated a willingness to provide some form of reimbursement for costs incurred  in the form of cash and or note receivable of million plus future product rebates 
based on our judgment at the time  we reduced the previously recorded current asset of million within prepaid expenses and other assets to million as of september  we continued to negotiate this settlement with our supplier and during the second quarter of  the supplier signed a final settlement agreement providing for additional reimbursements above what was recognized as of september  pursuant to the settlement  the supplier agreed to cash consideration of million  of which we received million subsequent to the signing of the settlement agreement  with the remaining million to be received in quarterly installments during additionally  our supplier committed to product rebates and or price concessions on product orders for a period of months from the execution of the settlement agreement  in return for our agreement to release our supplier from all obligations relating to the power supply failures known by us to date 
this agreement is not subject to any required future purchases 
in addition  we have commenced discussions with our general liability and errors and omissions insurance and underwriters and will continue to pursue our rights to cover any damages we incur and that are not reimbursed by our supplier 
the insurance company has issued a reservation of rights letter to us and at this time  it is not possible to estimate to what extent the residual amounts  if any  we will be covered by our carrier 
as of december  we have not assumed or recorded any insurance reimbursement 
to the extent our settlement agreements with our customer and our component supplier are not on mutually beneficial terms  or our component supplier does not continue to reimburse us for the expenses incurred by us or our customers  and we are unsuccessful in recovering such expenses from our insurance provider  we could incur additional expenses which could potentially have a material effect on our financial statements and liquidity 
valuation of inventories inventories are comprised of finished goods and purchased parts and assemblies  which include direct labor and overhead  and are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market value 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate excess or obsolete inventory 
the determination of excess or obsolete inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products 
because our markets are volatile  are subject to technological risks  price changes and inventory reduction programs by our customers  and as we are required to make last time buys of certain components on occasion  there is a risk that we will forecast incorrectly and produce excess inventories of particular products or have commitments to purchase excess inventory components from our suppliers 
as a result  actual demand will differ from forecasts  and such a difference has in the past and may in the future have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and our results of operations 
any write downs to inventory due to the existence of excess quantities  physical obsolescence  changes in pricing  damage  or other causes establish a new cost basis for the inventory 
when we sell or dispose of reserved inventory the new cost basis is charged to cost of sales 
the largest factor affecting the accuracy of our provisions for excess inventories is the accuracy of our production and service forecasts of end customer demand 
the accuracy of our estimates depends in part on the accuracy of the non binding forecasts we get from our end customers  the accuracy of our own forecast of warranty requirements of our customers  the demand for storage systems in our market segments and the speed at which our products are designed in or out of our customers products 
long lived asset impairment we periodically review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment in the carrying value of an asset group is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value 
the amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value 
fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
in february  our board of directors approved a plan to exit our assureduvs business and close down our israel technology development center see note  at which time it was determined that the valuations at that date were appropriate 
during the second quarter of  we explored the potential sale of the assureduvs business  but were unsuccessful in 
table of contents locating a buyer and ended efforts to sell the business or its component assets as of june  accordingly  we recognized an impairment of million of property  plant and equipment and million for the remaining value of acquired software as a component of cost of goods sold as of june  the assureduvs business is now recorded in discontinued operations  since we have ceased all ongoing operational activities as of december  in september   we identified a change in circumstances that indicated the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  as our primary assureduvs customer informed us that the assureduvs software would no longer be a component of its business strategy  which would result in a significant decline in revenues for the company 
our long lived assets consisted of the intangible assets associated with our acquisition of certain identified cloverleaf assets acquired in january with an original carrying value of million and property and equipment of million 
since we did not have an immediate replacement for our assureduvs customer  management s forecasted undiscounted cash flows indicated that the assets were potentially not recoverable  and proceeded to estimate the fair value of each long lived asset 
property and equipment consisted of mostly machinery and equipment used for testing and development of our assureduvs technology 
management determined that carrying value approximated fair value  as property was either acquired in the acquisition of cloverleaf  had been purchased subsequently  or could be re deployed  establishing recent evidence of fair value 
it was depreciated over a year estimated useful life 
intangible assets consisted primarily of acquired software of million and a trade name of million 
we determined the fair value of the acquired software by estimating the replacement cost of the software  taking into account both the software as acquired and subsequent development work  as well as the business alternatives we were considering and the corresponding value of the software in these alternative approaches 
we estimated the value of the software based on the probabilities of each of the business alternatives 
we determined the fair value of the trade name using an income approach and considered the fact that the software s trade name at the time of acquisition was no longer being used 
all estimates were based on management using appropriate assumptions and projections 
our impairment analysis at september  identified million of impaired long lived assets  consisting entirely of intangible assets recognized as part of the cloverleaf acquisition in long lived asset impairment charges are recorded consistent with our treatment of related amortization expense specific to each acquired intangible asset 
we recorded million of impairment to acquired software and million of impairment to acquired trade name as a component of cost of goods sold for the year ended december  share based compensation we account for share based compensation by measuring and recognizing share based compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options  restricted stock awards  performance based restricted stock awards and employee stock purchase plan shares  for which expense will be recognized over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award  at the date of grant 
the estimation of stock option and employee stock purchase plan fair value requires management to make complex estimates and judgments about  among other things  employee exercise behavior  forfeiture rates and the volatility of our common stock 
these judgments directly affect the amount of compensation expense that will ultimately be recognized 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date fair value is calculated based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant  multiplied by the number of shares granted  and is recognized as expense over the respective vesting period 
compensation expense for performance based restricted stock awards is measured similarly to restricted stock  however  compensation expense is only recorded for awards that ultimately vest  which is contingent upon employees achieving various performance criteria 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the fair values generated by the black scholes model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use historical volatility of our stock for the expected life of the grant as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
our selection of the historical volatility approach is due to the limited availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  share based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the 
table of contents past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated percentages may not aggregate due to rounding years ended december  net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net loss before income taxes and discontinued operations income tax expense loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenue year ended december  decrease change in thousands  except percentages net revenue net revenues decreased approximately million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the change in net revenue was primarily due to a million increase in sales to our vertical markets customers  which included a million increase in sales to tektronix  and a million increase in sales to other oem customers  offset by a million decrease in revenue from hp from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  however  we expect sales to hp to continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenue during sales to hp approximated of our net revenue for the year ended december  compared to of our net revenue for the year ended december  during the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and the accounting analysis for the renewal of a long term software contract  the company determined that it had applied an inappropriate revenue recognition methodology in and to this contract 
the company recorded revenue as royalty payments were received on this contract and should have deferred all the revenue until all the deliverables  except pcs  were delivered in this resulted in an overstatement of million and million of revenue in and  respectively 
this was corrected in  and the net out of period impact of these adjustments was a reduction of revenue of million 
cost of goods sold and gross profit 
table of contents increase decrease change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in thousands  except percentages cost of goods sold gross profit cost of goods sold decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of a more favorable mix of sales revenue and cost reductions  which were partially offset by increased payroll related costs and the correction of the accounting for the long term software contract as discussed in note to the financial statements 
gross profit margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  gross profit margin benefited from a more favorable product and customer mix  in addition to a decrease in warranty related costs  due to a one time charge in related to failed power supplies  and favorable pricing from our contract manufacturer and vendors as compared to research and development expenses increase change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses research and development expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in salaries and payroll expense  a million increase in project materials expense  a million increase in consulting expenses  a million increase in depreciation expense  and a million increase in allocated costs 
these cost increases were partially offset by deferring million in direct and incremental engineering costs related to a long term customer software contract see note to the financial statements 
the increase in salaries and payroll related expense is the result of the reinstatement of salary reductions which were in effect throughout the increase in salaries expense is also the result of increased headcount focused on customizations for newer oem customers  the launch of the company series and mid range products and next generation product development 
the increase in project materials expense and depreciation expense is the result of an increase in capital assets and project supplies required to support new customer wins  the launch of our mid range products  and the development of our next generation storage products due to be released in the increase in allocated costs is due to increased headcount and equipment necessary to support the research and development function 
the increase in consulting expense is primarily the result of an increased reliance on domestic and foreign engineering consultants to assist certain engineering functions with strategic development projects 
we expect that the timing of our engineering material purchases and additional headcount requirements to support new product releases will affect the amount of research and development expenses in future periods 
sales and marketing expenses decrease change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expense increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in evaluation unit expenses of million due to the promotion of our new products and to encourage sales opportunities with new oems 
other expenses increased million 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increase change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in thousands  except percentages general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was partially due to a million increase in salaries and payroll related expenses for the hiring of key administrative personnel 
additionally  consulting and recruiting fees increased million from prior year 
professional fees also increased by million as a result of an increase in special projects performed by one of our service providers  offset partially by a decrease in investor relations expenses  due to a one time charge in for a media segment created to target new investors  along with bundling of certain investor relations services during to reduce costs 
realized and unrealized currency gains and losses were unfavorable during and favorable in  causing an unfavorable change from year to year of million

the increase from prior year is due to an increase in our unrecognized tax positions related to our foreign entities  due to changes in transfer pricing policies and other regulations in the countries in which we operate 

table of contents loss from discontinued operations decrease change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in thousands  except percentages loss from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decline in losses was primarily driven by the company decision in the first quarter of to close down our israel technology center and exit out of our assureduvs business 
this decrease was primarily due to a decline in operating expenses from discontinued operations of million 
the decrease in operating expenses primarily consisted of a decrease in research and development expense of million  a decrease in sales and marketing expense of million  and an impairment of goodwill of million recorded in  partially offset by an increase in restructuring charges of million 
total operating expenses from discontinued operations decreased primarily due to a million decrease in salaries and payroll related expenses  a million decrease in depreciation expense  a million decrease in stock based compensation expense and an impairment of goodwill of million recorded in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in professional service fees of million 
in addition  we realized a benefit due to an increase in gross profit of million  primarily driven by a decrease of million in revenue and a decrease of million cost of goods sold 
the decrease in cost of goods sold was primarily a result of a million intangible impairment charge in all of the above are a result of activity related to our plan to exit our assureduvs business and close down our israel technology development center

year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenue year ended december  decrease change in thousands  except percentages net revenue the decrease in net revenue for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december   was primarily due to the decision in the fourth quarter of to exit our low margin business with netapp 
sales to netapp totaled million for the year ended december  and totaled for the year ended december  a portion of the lost netapp sales were replaced by sales to oem partners other than hp which grew to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  without netapp sales in  our net revenue would have increased in over sales to hp remained flat year over year  totaling million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  due largely to the shortage of hard disk drives in the fourth quarter of as well as hp inventory optimization initiatives 
sales to hp are due to the successful launch and market acceptance of the hp msa products  which includes our series products and the launch by hp of its third generation product line  now called the p product line  in february  which includes our series products 
although our series products are in the decline phase of the product life cycle  demand for these products continued to be significant 
we released our next generation series products in the first quarter of and sales of these products increased significantly during each quarter of  and remained consistent throughout cost of goods sold and gross profit 
table of contents decrease change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in thousands  except percentages cost of goods sold gross profit cost of goods sold decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of the decrease in sales 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to exiting the low margin netapp business  the growth in channel and non hp oem sales  internal cost reduction initiatives and decreases in manufacturing support costs and manufacturing variances 
these decreases were partially offset by the cost of goods sold associated with the increase in sales to other oem customers and the recognition of impairment charges relating to certain of our long lived assets held at our itc reporting unit 
partially offsetting the increase in gross profit margin were higher warranty related expenses of million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in warranty related expenses increased primarily as a result of quality issues associated with certain power supply devices provided by one of our component suppliers that required us to make substantial repairs and provide replacement parts 
our gross profit margin is typically sensitive to product and customer mix changes 
for example  our gross profit margin on sales of the products we sell to hp is higher than the gross profit margin on the products we previously sold to netapp 
in addition  sales of our software products and services typically have a much higher gross profit margin than that of our hardware products 
also  sales to our channel customers typically have a higher gross profit margin than sales to our tier oem customers 
for the year ended december   we generated a higher percentage of our net revenue from our channel customers  non hp oem s and from sales of software and services  which had a favorable impact on our gross profit margin 
research and development expenses increase change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses research and development expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a net increase in salaries and payroll related expenses of million  a net increase in stock compensation expenses of million  an increase in engineering materials of million  a net increase in depreciation expense of million  an increase in consulting costs of million and an increase in software and maintenance charges of million 
the increase in salary and payroll related expenses is primarily a result of the additional employees engaged in research and development activities associated with the development of next generation entry level products and a mid range product line 
the increase in stock compensation expenses is due to a large portion of stock awards vesting in early when the stock price was elevated compared with the prior year 
the increase in engineering materials is largely the result of the timing of our engineering material purchases in conjunction with the release of our next generation of products in consulting costs increased largely as a result of certain engineering functions being performed by consultants in india and an increase in the use of domestic engineering consultants to assist with certain strategic development projects 
the increase in depreciation expense was primarily the result of additional capital expenditures for our longmont engineering labs 
sales and marketing expenses 
table of contents increase change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in commissions and bonuses of million  a net increase in stock compensation expenses of million  an increase in bank fees of million  an increase in travel expenses of million  and other miscellaneous net increases of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in customer related evaluation product expenses of million 
the increase in commissions and bonuses is due to better performance against sales goals 
the net increase in stock compensation expenses is due to a new stock bonus plan in and an overall increase in awards 
the net increase in salary and payroll related expenses is primarily a result of additional employees engaged in sales and marketing activities as a result of an increase in the number of sales territories we support and the continued expansion of our channel program 
the increase in travel expenses was primarily the result of an increase in sales team employees and customer visits 
the increase in bank fees is for credit card merchant fees assessed for one customer that pays by credit card 
the decrease in customer related evaluation product expenses is due to new product releases in general and administrative expenses decrease change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in thousands  except percentages general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in salary and payroll related expenses of million  a reduction in consulting fees of million  a net reduction in other miscellaneous expenses of million and a reduction in accounting  legal and advisory fees of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in stock compensation related expenses of million and an increase in bad debt expenses of million 
the change in accounting  legal and advisory fees was primarily the result of negotiating lower fees with our service providers 
the reduction in salary and payroll related expenses primarily was attributable to a reduction in salaries mandated by executive management that were in effect for part of and for all of consulting fees were elevated in compared with  as the company made the conscious decision in to hire temporary labor instead of full time employees anticipating the move from carlsbad  california to longmont  colorado 
restructuring charge recovery decrease change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in thousands  except percentages restructuring charge recovery in december  our management approved  committed to  and initiated a restructuring plan  or the plan  to improve efficiencies in our operations  which was largely driven by our plan to consolidate our facility in carlsbad  california into the longmont  colorado facility 
in the second quarter of  our management approved  committed to  and initiated a restructuring and cost reduction plan  or the plan  to better align our resources in order to lower our breakeven point 
the plan included severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately of our workforce  and fees associated with the acceleration of the closure of our carlsbad  california facility 
for the year ended december   we incurred severance and related costs of million related to both our plan and plan 
we also incurred contract termination costs of million for the 
table of contents year ended december   primarily for facility lease and other associated costs that we continued to incur without economic benefit and due to revisions to our assumptions regarding the timing and amount of tenant sublease income under both our plan and plan 
the million restructuring expense for the year ended december  is primarily related to management s determination that sublease rental income anticipated on the carlsbad  california facility would not materialize  and the associated write off of that expected rental income

loss from discontinued operations increase change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue in thousands  except percentages loss from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in losses was due to the following factors a decrease in gross profit of million  primarily driven by an increase of million in revenue and an increase of million in cost of goods sold  the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily a result of a million intangible impairment charge in an increase in operating expenses  primarily consisting of an increase in research and development expense of million  an increase in sales and marketing expense of million  and an impairment of goodwill of million recorded in  partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expense of million  including restructuring costs 
operating expenses from discontinued operations increased primarily due to a million increase in salaries and payroll related expenses and a million increase in depreciation expense 
all of the above are a result of activity related to our assureduvs business located at our israel technology development center 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more details regarding our discontinued operations 
a decline in our itc reporting unit s assureduvs customer base resulted in a significant decline in actual and planned earnings and we determined it was more likely than not that the itc reporting unit was worth less than its carrying value 
as a result we tested goodwill related to our itc reporting unit for impairment as of september   and determined that the carrying value of goodwill was impaired 
we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment resulting in the recognition of an impairment to goodwill of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources 
table of contents the primary drivers affecting cash and liquidity are net losses  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
historically  the payment terms we have had to offer our customers have been relatively similar to the terms received from our creditors and suppliers 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard credit quality and payment terms ranging between net and net days 
if our net revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
conversely  if our net revenue decreases  it is likely that our accounts receivable will also decrease 
our accounts receivable could increase if customers  such as large oem customers  delay their payments or if we grant them extended payment terms 
our accounts payable also increase or decrease in connection with changes in volumes as well as our cash conservation strategies 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital compared to million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital as of december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is further described below 
cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased with a weighted average maturity of days or less and consist principally of short term money market mutual funds 
as of december   million of the million of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds are needed for our operations in the us  we could be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the operating activities that affected cash consisted of a net loss  which totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  in addition to the factors discussed below 
the adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  for items that did not affect cash consisted of depreciation and amortization of million  long lived asset impairment charges of million  loss on the write off of fixed assets related to our itc business of million  and stock based compensation expense of million 
cash flows from operations reflects the positive impact of million related to a decrease in accounts receivable  which was primarily due to a decrease in the number of days sales outstanding  which decreased from days at december  to days at december  cash flows from operations also reflects the positive impact of million related to an overall decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets at december   which was primarily due to payments received from a material component supplier in relation to certain failed power supply units 
deferred revenue had a million positive impact to cash from operations due to royalty payments received related to a long term software contract 
cash flows from operations also reflect the impact of million related to an overall increase in other long term liabilities  primarily due to increased deferred rents on our facility lease in longmont  co 
additionally  there was a small change in inventory that resulted in a positive impact to cash flows of million 
cash flows from operations reflect a negative impact of million  due to the pay down of our accounts payable balance which is also reflected in our days payable outstanding which decreased from days at december  to days at december  accrued compensation and other expenses negatively impacted the cash from operations by million due to settling a large invoice for software licenses and payments on a settlement with a material customer related to failed power supply units 
cash flows from operations also include a decrease in our restructuring accrual of million which is due primarily to payments related to shutting down the israel technology development center and continued payments related to our plan and plan contractual commitments 
investing activities cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was due to purchases of property and equipment primarily associated with test and other equipment used by our contract manufacturing partners in the production of our products and for equipment used in our longmont  colorado engineering laboratories 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to million for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to million of net borrowings under the silicon valley bank line of credit and the sale of stock to 
table of contents employees under our employee stock plans of approximately million  which was offset by tax liability payments of million made by dot hill associated with employee equity awards and million for the remaining pay down of our note payable associated with our acquisition of certain intangible assets from ciprico 
based on current macro economic conditions and conditions in the state of the data storage systems markets  our own organizational structure and our current outlook  we presently expect our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations  working capital and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  our capital resources could be negatively impacted by unforeseen future events 
our standard warranty provides that if our systems do not function to published specifications  we will repair or replace the defective component or system without charge generally for a period of approximately three years 
we generally extend to our customers the warranties provided to us by our suppliers  and accordingly  the majority of our warranty obligations to customers are typically intended to be covered by corresponding supplier warranties 
for warranty costs not covered by our suppliers  we provide for estimated warranty costs in the period the revenue is recognized 
there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to provide such warranties to us in the future or that our warranty obligations to our customers will be covered by corresponding warranties from our suppliers  the absence of which could have a material effect on our financial statements 
estimated liabilities for product warranties are included in accrued expenses 
in october  we discovered a quality issue associated with certain power supply devices provided by a long term component supplier  which resulted in a higher than expected level of power supply failures to us and our customers 
while we were able to promptly identify and resolve the cause of the failures  we are required to provide replacement products or make repairs to the affected power supply units that had been sold between march and october through june   our component supplier had repaired all of the faulty power supplies at no cost to us and reimbursed us for our out of pocket costs  which has constituted a reimbursement to customers for certain out of pocket costs they incurred in connection with these power supply failures 
the total amount reimbursed to us by our component supplier approximated million through june  in the second and third quarters of  a material customer provided us with a framework estimating the potential claims precipitated by the power supply failures 
as previously disclosed  the customer s preliminary framework of potential claims provided to us included additional costs related to the customer s internal overhead for other internal indirect costs  in addition to third party direct costs 
based on preliminary discussions for settlement and our analysis of the framework provided by the customer  including future potential claims through the warranty period  we estimated that we had incurred a probable loss of approximately million 
consequently  in addition to the million previously recognized as of june   we recorded an estimated liability of million as of september  within accrued expenses on our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
negotiations continued with our customer throughout the fourth quarter of into the first half of based on the results of ongoing negotiations with the material customer  we increased our estimated liability at december  to million  resulting in a charge of million during the fourth quarter of within accrued expenses on our condensed consolidated balance sheet  gross of any third party recoveries 
a final settlement with this material customer was reached during the second quarter of the terms of the agreement required an immediate payment of million and an estimated remaining liability of approximately million as of december   a portion of which relates to future price concessions and rebates based on sales volumes through december  the remaining portion relates to costs for extension of warranty coverage on these units 
while our estimated liability relating to failed power supply units is subject to some uncertainty  based on our current expectation of sales volumes with this material customer  we do not believe the incurrence of an additional loss is either probable or reasonably possible at this time 
during the second quarter of  based on the advice of legal counsel  we established that our component supplier is contractually obligated to reimburse us for fair and reasonable costs we incur with our customers associated with these power supply failures 
our component supplier had continued to re work and distribute to our customer the affected population of power supplies at no cost to us 
in addition  at the time  our collection experience with similar amounts already reimbursed to us by our supplier and our belief that our component supplier and its parent companies had the financial ability to continue to reimburse us for any additional costs we may incur  we recorded a current asset within prepaid expenses and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet of million as of june  during the third quarter of  as the claims from our customer became clearer  we commenced negotiations with our component supplier for fair and reasonable costs that we have and are likely to incur through the warranty period associated with this component failure 
originally we determined that the supplier was unlikely to make an up front cash payment for the original settlement amount of million  but it indicated a willingness to provide some form of reimbursement for costs 
table of contents incurred  in the form of cash and or note receivable of million plus future product rebates 
based on our judgment at the time  we reduced the previously recorded current asset of million within prepaid expenses and other assets to million as of september  we continued to negotiate this settlement with our supplier and during the second quarter of  the supplier signed a final settlement agreement providing for additional reimbursements above what was recognized as of september  pursuant to the settlement  the supplier agreed to cash consideration of million  of which we received million subsequent to the signing of the settlement agreement  with the remaining million to be received in quarterly installments during additionally  our supplier committed to product rebates and or price concessions on product orders for a period of months from the execution of the settlement agreement  in return for our agreement to release our supplier from all obligations relating to the power supply failures known by us to date 
this agreement is not subject to any required future purchases 
in addition  we have commenced discussions with our general liability and errors and omissions insurance and underwriters and will continue to pursue our rights to cover any damages we incur and that are not reimbursed by our supplier 
the insurance company has issued a reservation of rights letter to us and at this time  it is not possible to estimate to what extent the residual amounts  if any  we will be covered by our carrier 
as of december  we have not assumed or recorded any insurance reimbursement 
during september  our primary assureduvs customer became delinquent on the settlement of its payables to us and upon our investigation it became evident that its financial resources were limited 
it also informed us that it was changing its strategy  which would result in a significant decline in revenue for the company  and we determined that the reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
the impairment of the goodwill related to the reporting unit is now reported in discontinued operations see note  since we have ceased all ongoing operational activities as of december  the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing and extent of net revenue and expenditures from our core business and strategic investments  the overall level of net profits or losses  our ability to manage our relationships with our contract manufacturers  the potential growth or decline in inventory to support our customers  costs associated with product quality issues and the recovery  if any  of such costs from a supplier  the status of our relationships with key customers  partners and suppliers  the timing and extent of the introduction of new products and services  growth in operations and the economic environment 
in addition  the actual amount and timing of working capital will depend on our ability to maintain payment terms with our suppliers consistent with the credit terms of our customers 
for example  if foxconn  our major contract manufacturing partner  were to shorten our payment terms with them  or if hp were to lengthen their payment terms with us  our financial condition could be harmed 
we maintain a credit facility with silicon valley bank for cash advances and letters of credit of up to an aggregate of million based upon an advance rate dependent on certain concentration limits within eligible accounts receivable 
these limitations exclude certain eligible customer receivables if an individual customer account balance exceeds  or percent of the total eligible accounts receivable  depending on the customer  as defined by our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the prime rate  which was at december   and are secured by substantially all of our accounts receivable  deposit and securities accounts 
the agreement provides for a negative pledge on our inventory and intellectual property  subject to certain exceptions  and contains usual and customary covenants for an arrangement of its type  including an obligation that we maintain at all times a net worth  as defined in the agreement  of million subject to certain increases 
the agreement also includes provisions to increase the financing facility by million subject to our meeting certain requirements  including million in borrowing base for the immediately preceding days  and silicon valley bank locating a lender willing to finance the additional facility 
in addition  if our cash and cash equivalents net of the total amount outstanding under the credit facility fall below million measured on a rolling three month basis  the interest rate will increase to prime plus and additional restrictions will apply 
our credit facility also provides for a cash management services sublimit under the revolving credit line of up to million 
during the second quarter of  we amended our credit agreement with silicon valley bank 
the amendment extends the maturity date to july  and amended certain other terms of the credit agreement  which we do not believe significantly impacts our financial position 
as of december  we had no outstanding letters of credit and there was million outstanding under the silicon valley bank line of credit 
there was million available for borrowing under the agreement as of december  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 

table of contents contractual obligations total thereafter operating lease obligations inventory related purchase obligations other purchase obligations credit facility borrowings total we lease office space  equipment and automobiles under non cancelable operating leases  which expire at various dates through may  for purposes of the table above  the operating lease obligations exclude common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance expenses 
inventory related purchase obligations represent contractual purchase commitments to our suppliers for certain components in order to ensure supply of select key components at the most favorable pricing 
other purchase obligations represent purchase commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance variable interest  or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships and transactions with persons and entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed herein 
we enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business that generally require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events  such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement 
these indemnification obligations are considered off balance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 
such indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses 
historically  we have not incurred material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements 
recent accounting pronouncements please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we place our cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions  investing primarily in money market accounts 
we have established guidelines relative to credit ratings  diversification and maturities that seek to maintain safety and liquidity 
our investment strategy generally results in lower yields on investments but reduces the risk to principal in the short term prior to these funds being invested in our business 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
in this regard  changes in interest rates can affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents 
a unfavorable change in the interest rate would not significantly impact our december  financial statements 
we have a line of credit agreement  which accrues interest on any outstanding balances at the prime rate 
as of december   there was million outstanding under this line 
as we make borrowings under this line  we are exposed to interest rate risk on such debt 
indicated changes in interest rates are based on hypothetical movements and are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
future earnings and losses will be affected by actual fluctuations in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
table of contents we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar  the currency in which our consolidated financial statements are reported 
the most significant foreign currencies that subjected us to foreign currency exchange rate risk for the year ended december  were the euro  british pound  and the japanese yen 
correspondingly  our operating results could be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate volatility relative to the us dollar 
although we continue to evaluate strategies to mitigate risks related to the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we will likely continue to recognize gains or losses from international transactions and foreign currency changes 
although foreign currency transaction gains and losses have not historically been significant  we incurred million in foreign currency gains during the year ended december   primarily resulting from the re measurement process of certain of our foreign subsidiaries that maintain their books of record in a currency other than the functional currency 
future changes in foreign currency rates could adversely impact our financial statements 
a unfavorable change in exchange rates would result in foreign currency losses of approximately million
