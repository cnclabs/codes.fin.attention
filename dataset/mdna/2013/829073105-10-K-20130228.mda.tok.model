products simpson strong tie manufactures and markets building products and is a recognized brand name in residential and commercial applications 
the product lines historically have encompassed connectors  anchors  fasteners and lateral resistive systems 
more recently  simpson strong tie has entered into the truss plate market and acquired product lines for the marine  industrial and transportation markets 
the wood construction products group includes connectors  truss plates  fastening systems and shearwalls 
connectors are prefabricated metal products that attach wood  concrete  masonry or steel together 
the metal connectors for wood can join solid sawn lumber  glued laminated beams  engineered wood  structural composite lumber and plated trusses 
specialty structural connectors have also been developed for cold formed steel construction 
connectors are essential for tying construction elements together and create safer and stronger buildings 
integrated component systems is the name of simpson strong tie s full line of truss connector plates and software 
truss plates are toothed metal plates that join wood trusses together 
sst uses sophisticated software analysis to model and design the trusses and to select appropriate truss plates for component manufacturers 
the fastener line includes coated or stainless steel hand drive nails and screws in addition to stainless collated nails and staples 
sst also offers a line of proprietary structural screws used to join plies of wood together or metal connectors to wood 
complimenting these products is the quik drive auto feed screw driving system used in numerous applications such as decking  subfloors  drywall and roofing 
sst s lateral resistive systems are assemblies used to resist earthquake or wind forces and include strong wall shearwalls  anchor tiedown systems ats  uplift restraint systems urs  and ordinary and special steel moment frames

most simpson strong tie products are approved by building code evaluation agencies 
to achieve such approvals  sst conducts extensive product testing  which is witnessed and certified by independent testing laboratories 
the tests also provide the basis of load ratings for the sst structural products 
this test and load information is used by architects  engineers  contractors  building officials and homeowners and is useful across all applications of sst s products  ranging from the deck constructed by a homeowner to a multi story structure designed by an architect or engineer 
new product and software development sst commits substantial resources to new product development 
the majority of sst s products have been developed through its internal research and development program 
sst s research and development expense for the three years ended december   and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
sst believes it is the only united states manufacturer with the capability to test multi story wall systems  thus enabling testing rather than calculations alone to prove system performance 
sst engineering  sales  product management  and marketing teams work together with architects  engineers  building inspectors  code officials and customers in the new product development process 
sst s product research and development is based largely on needs that customers communicate to sst and on sst s strategic initiatives to develop new markets or product lines 
sst s strategy is to develop new products on a proprietary basis  to patent them when appropriate and to rely on trade secret protection for others 
sst typically develops to new products each year 
in  the company expanded its wood construction products offering with the release of the strong frame special moment frame utilizing the company s patented yield link structural fuse 
similar to the way an electrical fuse protects electronics  a structural fuse is designed to sacrifice itself to save a larger structural element  in this case a moment frame 
these fuses can be replaced after a large seismic event by unbolting the damaged yield links and bolting on new fuses allowing the moment frame to remain in the structure during replacement  greatly reducing the cost and time of repairs 
the company launched an innovative and proprietary wood screw fastener for floor to floor connection that combines a specially designed long strong drive structural wood screw sdws with a patent pending take up washer that is designed to allow for wood shrinkage and building settlement while maintaining a tight connection between floors 
in addition  the company introduced concealed post tie and adjustable post base connector products for concealed installation and retrofit applications 
the company also released several new truss connector products for high load  severe skew and multiple member support  along with the component hoist clip  a connector for hoisting the wood frame  and cold formed steel cfs components 
the company launched several other new sdws products  such as a fastener for connecting wood trusses or rafters to the top of walls that resists uplift forces from high wind  a fastener for log home construction and a fastener for both wood and composite decking to wood or steel support elements 
the concrete construction product line also saw the release of several new products in the company expanded its mechanical anchor offing with a new stitch tie product designed to be used on existing masonry to repair cracks in walls and to increase their flexural strength 
two new code listed bridging connectors for cfs studs were introduced  as was a new line spiral knurled pins  installed with a second generation new gas actuated tool for attaching plywood and oriented strand board to cold formed steel 
the company also released a number of pre assembled accessory pins for mechanical  electrical and plumbing applications for this new gas actuated tool 
within its powder driven pin line the company launched a new range of pins that offer higher shear and tension performance in normal weight concrete and structural steel 
sst has also redesigned several existing products in both its wood and concrete construction product lines to increase load capacity  reduce installation cost and enable the rationalization of sst s product range 
while continuing to serve the single family residential new housing market  sst has increased development efforts for products used in multi family residential markets and some light commercial and industrial markets  including cfs construction 
distribution channels have been receptive to these new products

in recent years  home centers have been one of sst s important distribution channels  and sst s sales to the home depot exceeded of the company s consolidated net sales in  and see item a risk factors  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
sst s diy and dealer products are used to build projects such as decks  patio covers and garage organization systems 
sst dedicates substantial resources to customer service 
sst produces numerous publications and point of sale marketing aids to serve specifiers  distributors  retailers and users for the various markets that it serves 
these publications include general catalogs  as well as various specific catalogs  such as those for its fastener products 
the catalogs and publications describe the products and provide load and installation information 
sst also maintains several linked websites centered on www 
strongtie 
com  which include catalogs  product and technical information  code reports and other general information related to sst s product lines and promotional programs 
sst s engineers not only design and test products  but also provide engineering support for customers 
for example  this support might range from the discussion of a load value in a catalog to testing the suitability of an existing product in a unique application 
sst s sales force communicates with customers in each of its marketing channels  through its publications  seminars and frequent sales calls 
based on its communications with customers  sst believes that its products are important to its customers businesses  and it is sst s policy to ship products within a few days of receiving the order  with many of the orders shipped the same day 
many of sst s customers serve contractors that require rapid delivery of needed products 
home centers and dealers also require superior service because of fluctuating demand and to serve the needs of a broad base of customers 
to satisfy these requirements  sst maintains appropriate inventory levels  has redundant manufacturing capability and some multiple dies to produce the same parts 
sst maintains information systems that provide sales and inventory control and forecasting capabilities throughout its network of factories and warehouses 
sst has special programs for contractors intended to ensure the prompt manufacture and delivery of custom products 
simpson strong tie believes that dealer and home center sales of sst products are significantly greater when the bins and racks at dealer and home center locations are adequately stocked with appropriate products 
various retailers carry varying numbers of sst products 
sst s sales force is engaged in ongoing efforts to inform retailers about sst s merchandising programs and the appeal of the sst brand 
manufacturing process simpson strong tie designs and manufactures most of its standard products 
sst has concentrated on making its manufacturing processes as efficient as possible without compromising the quality or flexibility necessary to serve the needs of its customers 
sst has developed and uses automated manufacturing processes 
sst s innovative manufacturing systems and techniques have allowed it to control manufacturing costs  even while developing both new products and products that meet customized requirements and specifications 
sst s development of specialized manufacturing processes also has permitted increased operating flexibility and enhanced product design innovation 
as part of ongoing continuous improvement processes in its factories  sst s major north american and european manufacturing facilities initiated lean manufacturing practices to improve efficiency and customer service 
sst sources some products from third party vendors  both domestically and internationally 
sst is committed to helping people build safer structures economically through designing  engineering and manufacturing structural connectors  pre fabricated shearwalls  anchors  fasteners and related products 
with the support and involvement of management  sst has developed a quality system that manages defined procedures to ensure consistent product quality and also meets the requirements of international code council icc product evaluation reports 
sst is recognized in its industry as a manufacturer of high quality products 
since  sst s quality system has been registered under iso  an internationally recognized set of quality assurance standards 
the company believes that iso registration is a valuable tool for maintaining and promoting its high quality standards 
as sst establishes new business locations through expansion or acquisitions  projects are established to integrate sst s quality systems and achieve iso registration 
in addition  sst has six testing laboratories accredited to iso standard  an internationally accepted standard that provides requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories 
sst implements testing requirements through systematic control of its processes  enhancing sst s standard for quality products  whether produced by sst or purchased from others 
most of sst s wood construction products are produced with a high level of automation 
for example  its connector products are produced using progressive dies run in automatic presses making parts from coiled sheet steel at rates that often exceed strokes per minute 
sst estimates that it produced over million product pieces in sst has significant press capacity and has multiple dies for some of its high volume products to enable production of these products close to the customer and to provide back up capacity 
sst s also has smaller specialty production facilities  which primarily use batch production with some automated lines 
for example  in gallatin  tennessee  sst produces non ferrous and collated fasteners using automated batch production 
the balance of production is accomplished through a combination of manual  blanking and numerically controlled nc processes that include robotic welders  lasers and turret punches 
this capability allows sst to produce products with little redesign or set up time  facilitating rapid turnaround for customers 
new tooling is also highly automated 
dies are designed and produced using computer aided design cad and computer aided machining cam systems 
cad cam capability enables sst to create multiple dies quickly and design them to high standards 
sst is constantly reviewing its product line to reduce manufacturing costs  increase automation  and take advantage of new types of materials 
sst manufactures its concrete construction products at its facilities in zhangziajong  china  addison  illinois  baltimore  maryland  cardet  france  seewen  switzerland  malbork  poland  and elvas  portugal 
the mechanical anchor products are produced with a high level of automation 
some products  such as epoxy and adhesive anchors  are mixed in batches and are then loaded into one part or two part dispensers  which mix the product on the job site because set up times are usually very short 
in addition  sst purchases a number of products  powder actuated pins  tools and accessories and certain of its mechanical anchoring products  from various sources around the world 
these purchased products undergo inspections on a sample basis for conformance with ordered specifications and tolerances before being distributed 
regulation simpson strong tie s product lines are subject to federal  state  county  municipal and other governmental and quasi governmental regulations that affect product development  design  testing  analysis  load rating  application  marketing  sales  installation and use 
a substantial portion of sst products have been evaluated and are recognized by governmental agencies and product evaluation report agencies 
some of the entities that recognize sst products include the international code council evaluation service icc es  the international association of plumbing and mechanical officials uniform evaluation service iapmo es  the city of los angeles larr s  the state of florida  and california s division of the state architect dsa 
these entities require that products be evaluated to applicable code requirements  design standards and test procedures 
if there are no applicable testing and design standards in the current code for a product  these entities may develop their own product acceptance or evaluation criteria which must be followed to obtain the product s recognition and listing 
sst considers product evaluation  recognition and listing to the building code as a significant tool that facilitates and expedites the use of sst s products by design professionals  building officials  inspectors and contractors 
industry members are more likely to use building products that have the appropriate recognition and listing than products that lack this acceptance 
sst devotes considerable time and testing resources to obtaining and maintaining appropriate listings for its products 
sst actively participates in industry related professional associations and building code committees both to keep abreast of regulatory changes and to provide comments and expertise to these regulatory agencies 
competition simpson strong tie faces a variety of competition in all of the markets in which it participates 
this competition ranges from subsidiaries of large national or international corporations to small regional manufacturers 
while price is an important factor  sst also competes on the basis of quality  breadth of product line  proprietary technology  technical support  availability of inventory  service including custom design and manufacturing  field support and product innovation 
as a result of differences in structural design and building practices and codes  sst s markets tend to differ by region 
within these regions  sst competes with companies of varying size  several of which also distribute their products nationally or internationally 
see item a risk factors 
raw materials the principal raw material used by simpson strong tie is steel  including stainless steel 
sst generally orders steel to specific american society of testing and materials astm standards 
sst also uses materials such as carbon fiber  epoxies and acrylics in the manufacture of its chemical anchoring and reinforcing products 
sst purchases raw materials from a variety of commercial sources 
sst s practice is to seek cost savings and enhanced quality by purchasing from a limited number of suppliers 
the steel industry is highly cyclical and prices for sst s raw materials are influenced by numerous factors beyond sst s control  including general economic conditions  competition  labor costs  foreign exchange rates  import duties  raw material shortages and trade restrictions 
the steel market continues to be dynamic  with a high degree of uncertainty about future pricing trends 
steel prices are expected to increase from their fourth quarter levels  as steel mills have been raising prices as expected demand returns to the steel markets 
sst expects steel prices to increase during the first half of numerous factors may cause steel prices to increase in the future 
in addition to increases in steel prices  mills have added surcharges for zinc  energy and freight in response to increases in their costs 
these and other factors could adversely affect sst s cost and access to steel in if steel prices increase and sst is not able to maintain its prices or increase them sufficiently  sst s margins could deteriorate 
see item a risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company historically has not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials 
patents and proprietary rights simpson strong tie has united states and foreign patents  the majority of which cover products that sst currently manufactures and markets 
these patents  and applications for new patents  cover various design aspects of sst s products  as well as processes used in their manufacture 
sst continues to develop new potentially patentable products  product enhancements and product designs 
although sst does not intend to apply for additional foreign patents covering existing products  sst has developed an international patent program to protect new products that it may develop 
in addition to seeking patent protection  sst relies on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain its competitive position 
see item a risk factors 
acquisitions and expansion into new markets the company s growth potential depends  to some extent  on its ability to penetrate new markets  both domestically and internationally 
see industry and market trends and business strategy 
therefore  the company may in the future pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses

risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following risks before you decide to buy or hold shares of our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition would likely suffer 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our stock 
this and other public reports may contain forward looking statements based on current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
those forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those forward looking statements as a result of many factors  as more fully described below and elsewhere in our public reports 
we do not undertake to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
worldwide economic conditions and credit tightening materially and adversely affect our business 
our business has been materially and adversely affected by changes in regional  national or global economic conditions 
such changes have included or may include reduced consumer spending  reduced availability of capital  inflation  deflation  adverse changes in interest rates  reduced energy availability and increased energy costs  and government initiatives to manage economic conditions 
continuing instability in financial markets and the deterioration of other national and global economic conditions may have further materially adverse effects on our operations  financial results or liquidity  including the following the financial stability of our customers or suppliers may be compromised  which could result in additional bad debts for us or non performance by suppliers  financial instability of the financial institutions where we have our cash balances invested could result in loss of our principal balance  one or more of the financial institutions that make available our revolving credit facility may become unable to fulfill their funding obligations  which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity  it may become even more costly or difficult for us to obtain the agreed or additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facility  and our assets may be impaired or subject to write down or write off 
uncertainty about current global economic conditions may cause consumers of our products to postpone or refrain from spending in response to tighter credit  negative financial news  declines in income or asset values  or other adverse economic events or conditions  which could materially reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
further deterioration of economic conditions would likely exacerbate these adverse effects  result in wide ranging  adverse and prolonged effects on general business conditions  and materially and adversely affect our operations  financial results and liquidity 
failure to comply with industry regulations could result in reduced sales and increased costs 
the design  capacity and quality of most of our products and manufacturing processes are subject to numerous and extensive regulations and standards promulgated by governmental  quasi governmental and industry organizations 
these regulations and standards are highly technical  complex and subject to frequent revision 
if our products or manufacturing processes fail to comply with any regulations or standards  we may not be able to manufacture and market our products profitably 
failure to comply with regulations and standards could therefore materially reduce our sales and increase our costs 
if we fail to compete effectively  our revenue and profit margins could decline 
we face a variety of competition in all of the markets in which we participate 
many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
in addition  other technologies may render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
other companies may find our markets attractive and enter those markets 
competitive pricing  including price competition or the introduction of new products  has in the past and may in the future have material adverse effects on our revenues and profit margins 
our ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on the specification or approval of our products by architects  engineers  building inspectors  building code officials and customers 
if a significant segment of those communities were to decide that the design  materials  manufacturing  testing or quality control of our products is inferior to that of any of our competitors  our sales and profits would be materially reduced 
if we lose all or part of a large customer  our sales and profits would decline 
we have substantial sales to a few large customers 
loss of all or part of our sales to a large customer would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profits 
our largest customer accounted for  and of net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
this customer may endeavor to replace our products in some or all markets  with lower priced products supplied by others or may otherwise reduce its purchases of our products 
we also might reduce our dependence on our largest customer by reducing or terminating sales to one or more of the customer s subsidiaries 
any reduction in  or termination of  our sales to this customer would at least temporarily  and possibly longer  cause a material reduction in our net sales  income from operations and net income 
a reduction in or elimination of our sales to our largest customer  or another of our larger customers  would increase our relative dependence on our remaining large customers 
in addition  our customers include retailers and distributors 
retail and distribution businesses have consolidated over time  which could increase the material adverse effect of losing any of them 
increases in prices of raw materials could negatively affect our sales and profits 
our principal raw material is steel  including stainless steel 
the steel industry is highly cyclical 
numerous factors beyond our control  such as general economic conditions  competition  worldwide demand  material and labor costs  energy costs  foreign exchange rates  import duties and other trade restrictions  influence prices for our raw materials 
consolidation among domestic integrated steel producers  changes in supply and demand in steel markets  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions  and other events have led to volatility in steel costs 
the domestic steel market is heavily influenced by three major united states manufacturers 
we have not always been able  and in the future we might not be able  to increase our product prices in amounts that correspond to increases in costs of raw materials  without materially and adversely affecting our sales and profits 
we have not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials 
in recent years  however  we have increased our steel purchases in an effort to mitigate the effects of rising steel prices 
in some years since our sales have declined with the declines in the housing and financial markets 
as a result  our inventory fluctuated substantially 
inventory fluctuation can materially and adversely affect our margins  cash flow and profits 
if we cannot protect our technology  we will not be able to compete effectively 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology  in part through patents 
we might not be able to protect or rely on our patents 
patents might not issue pursuant to pending patent applications 
others might independently develop the same or similar technology  develop around the patented aspects of any of our products or proposed products  or otherwise obtain access to or circumvent our proprietary technology 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain our competitive position 
we might not be able to protect our know how or other proprietary information 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our significant products  our sales and profits could be materially reduced 
in attempting to protect our proprietary information  we sometimes initiate lawsuits against competitors and others that we believe have infringed or are infringing our rights 
in such an event  the defendant may assert counterclaims to complicate or delay the litigation or for other reasons 
litigation may be very costly and may result in adverse judgments that affect our sales and profits materially and adversely 
integrating acquired businesses may divert management s attention away from our day to day operations 
we pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  for example overvaluation of acquired businesses  difficulties assimilating the operations and products of acquired businesses  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  undisclosed existing or potential liabilities of acquired businesses  slow acceptance or rejection of acquired businesses products by our customers  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  litigation involving activities  properties or products of acquired businesses  increased cost of regulatory compliance and enforcement  consumer and other claims related to products of acquired businesses  and the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses 
in addition  future acquisitions may involve our issuance of additional equity securities that dilute the value of our existing equity securities  increase our debt  and cause impairment and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
any acquisition could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
significant costs to integrate our acquired operations may negatively affect our financial condition and the market price of our stock 
we will incur costs from integrating acquired business operations  products and personnel 
these costs may be significant and may include expenses and other liabilities for employee redeployment  relocation or severance  combining teams and processes in various functional areas  reorganization or closures of facilities  and relocation or disposition of excess equipment 
the integration costs that we incur may negatively affect our profitability and the market price of our stock 
our future growth may depend on our ability to penetrate new domestic and international markets  which could reduce our profitability 
international construction customs  standards  techniques and methods differ from those in the united states 
laws and regulations applicable in new markets may be unfamiliar to us 
compliance may be substantially more costly than we anticipate 
as a result  we may need to redesign products  or invent or design new products  to compete effectively and profitably in new markets 
we expect that we will need significant time  which may be years  to generate substantial sales or profits in new markets 
other significant challenges to conducting business in foreign countries include  among other factors  local acceptance of our products  political instability  changes in import and export regulations  changes in tariff and freight rates  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and currency controls 
we might not be able to penetrate these markets and any market penetration that occurs might not be timely or profitable 
if we do not penetrate these markets within a reasonable time  we will be unable to recoup part or all of the significant investments we will have made in attempting to do so 
we may decide to dispose of assets and incur material expenses in doing so 
we have terminated in the past and may terminate in the future product lines or businesses if we determine that the cost of operating them is not warranted by their expected profitability 
for example  we sold the assets of our subsidiary simpson dura vent company  inc in and we terminated our heavy duty mechanical anchor systems business in ireland and germany in in addition to employee severance  lease buy outs and other shut down costs  the net realizable value may be substantially less than our carrying cost of the assets of terminated operations  resulting in material costs and materially and adversely affecting our sales  assets  profitability and financial condition 
seasons and business cycles affect our operating results 
our sales are seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
with some exceptions  our sales and income have historically been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters of the year  as customers purchase construction materials in the late spring and summer months for the construction season 
in addition  weather conditions  such as unseasonably warm  cold or wet weather  which affect  and sometimes delay or accelerate installation of some of our products  significantly affect our results of operations 
political and economic events can also affect our sales and profitability 
we have little control over the timing of customer purchases 
sales that we anticipate in one quarter may occur in another quarter  affecting both quarters results 
in addition  we incur significant expenses as we develop  produce and market our products in anticipation of future orders 
we maintain high inventory levels and typically ship orders as we receive them  so we operate with little backlog 
as a result  net sales in any quarter generally depend on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
a significant portion of our operating expenses is fixed 
planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
when sales do not meet our expectations  our operating results will be reduced for the relevant quarters  as we will have already incurred expenses based on those expectations 
our principal markets are in the building construction industry 
that industry is subject to significant volatility due to real estate market cycles  fluctuations in interest rates  the availability  or lack thereof  of credit to builders and developers  inflation rates  weather  and other factors and trends 
none of these factors or trends is within our control 
declines in commercial and residential construction  such as housing starts  and remodeling projects have reduced  and in the future can be expected to reduce  the demand for our products 
negative economic or construction industry performance adversely affects our business 
declines in construction activity or demand for our products have materially and adversely affected  and could in the future materially and adversely affect  our sales and profitability 
product liability claims and product recalls could harm our reputation  sales and financial condition 
we design and manufacture most of our standard products and expect to continue to do so  although we buy raw materials and some manufactured products from others 
we have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in the manufacturing  design or testing of our products 
we also have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in raw materials and finished goods produced by others 
some flaws and deficiencies have not been apparent until after the products were installed by customers 
many of our products are integral to the structural soundness or safety of the structures in which they are used 
if any flaws or deficiencies exist in our products and if such flaws or deficiencies are not discovered and corrected before our products are incorporated into structures  the structures could be unsafe or could suffer severe damage  such as collapse or fire  and personal injury could result 
errors in the installation of our products  even if the products are free of flaws and deficiencies  could also cause personal injury and unsafe structural conditions 
to the extent that such damage or injury is not covered by our product liability insurance and we are held to be liable  we could be required to correct such damage and to compensate persons who might have suffered injury  and our reputation  business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
even if a flaw or deficiency is discovered before any damage or injury occurs  we may need to recall products  and we may be liable for any costs necessary to replace recalled products or retrofit the affected structures 
any such recall or retrofit could entail substantial costs and adversely affect our reputation  sales and financial condition 
we do not carry insurance against recall costs or the adverse business effect of a recall  and our product liability insurance may not cover retrofit costs 
claims resulting from a natural disaster might be made against us with regard to damage or destruction of structures incorporating our products 
any such claims  if asserted  could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others may materially increase our expenses and reduce our profits 
other parties have in the past and may in the future claim that our products or processes infringe their patent rights and other intellectual property rights 
we may incur substantial costs and liabilities in investigating  defending and resolving such claims  whether or not they are meritorious  which may materially reduce our profitability and materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and may result in adverse rulings or decisions 
if any such infringement claim is asserted against us  we may be required to obtain a license or cross license  modify our existing technology or design a new non infringing technology  any of which could be costly and time consuming 
a ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit could include an injunction barring our production or sale of any infringing product 
a damage award against us could include an award of royalties or lost profits and  if the court finds willful infringement  treble damages and attorneys fees 
complying or failing to comply with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations could affect us materially and adversely 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions into the air  discharges into water  and generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
we are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters 
our manufacturing operations involve the use of solvents  chemicals  oils and other materials that are regarded as hazardous or toxic 
we also use complex and heavy machinery and equipment that can pose severe safety hazards  especially if not properly and carefully used 
some of our products also incorporate materials that are hazardous or toxic in some forms  such as zinc and lead used in some steel galvanizing processes  chemicals used in our acrylic and epoxy anchoring products  and chemicals used in our concrete repair  strengthening and protecting products 
the gun powder used in our powder actuated tools is explosive 
misuse of other materials in some of our products could also cause injury or sickness 
if we do not obtain all material licenses and permits required by environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  we may be subject to regulatory action by governmental authorities 
if our policies and procedures do not comply in all respects with existing environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  our activities might violate such laws and regulations 
even if our policies and procedures do comply  but our employees fail or neglect to follow them in all respects  we might incur similar liability 
relevant laws and regulations could change or new ones could be adopted that require us to obtain additional licenses and permits and cause us to incur substantial expense 
our generation  handling  use  storage  transportation  treatment or disposal of hazardous or toxic materials  machinery and equipment might cause injury to persons or to the environment 
we may need to take remedial action if properties that we occupy are contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances 
any change in laws or regulations  any legal or regulatory violations  or any contamination  could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we depend on key management and technical personnel  the loss of whom could harm our business 
we depend on certain key management and technical personnel  including  among others  thomas j fitzmyers  karen colonias  brian magstadt  phillip terry kingsfather  michael j 
herbert and jeffrey e 
mackenzie 
the loss of one or more key employees could materially and adversely affect us 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical  marketing and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of our activities 
we face strong competition for such personnel 
we might not be able to attract or retain such personnel 
in addition  when we experience periods with little or no profits  a decrease in compensation based on our profits may make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
any work stoppage or interruption by employees could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
a significant number of our employees are represented by labor unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that will expire in and a work stoppage or interruption by a significant number of our employees could have a material and adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
international operations expose us to foreign exchange rate risk 
we have foreign exchange rate risk in our international operations and through purchases from foreign vendors 
we do not currently hedge this risk 
changes in currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales and profitability 
natural disasters could decrease our manufacturing capacity 
most of our current and planned manufacturing facilities are located in geographic regions that have experienced major natural disasters  such as earthquakes  floods and hurricanes 
our disaster recovery plan may not be adequate or effective 
we do not carry earthquake insurance 
other insurance that we carry is limited in the risks covered and the amount of coverage 
our insurance would not be adequate to cover all of our resulting costs  business interruption and lost profits when a major natural disaster occurs 
a natural disaster rendering one or more of our manufacturing facilities totally or partially unusable  whether or not covered by insurance  would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
control by our principal stockholder reduces the ability of other stockholders to influence management 
barclay simpson  the chairman emeritus of our board of directors  controls approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
mr 
simpson and thomas j fitzmyers  the chairman of our board of directors even though mr 
fitzmyers owns less than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  have significant influence with respect to the election of our directors and over some fundamental changes affecting us  such as a merger or sale of assets or amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws 
additional financing  if needed  to fund our working capital  growth or acquisitions may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
if our cash requirements for working capital or to fund our growth increase to a level that exceeds the amount of cash that we generate from operations  or if we should decide to make an acquisition that requires more cash than we have available internally and through our current credit arrangements  we will need to seek additional financing 
in that event  we may need to enter into additional or new borrowing arrangements or consider equity financing 
additional or new borrowings may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
our ability to raise money by issuing and selling shares of our common or preferred stock would depend on general market conditions and the demand for our stock 
we may be unable to raise adequate capital on reasonable terms by selling stock 
if we sell stock  our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution 
our inability to secure additional financing could prevent the expansion of our business  internally and through acquisitions 
any issuance of preferred stock may dilute your investment and reduce funds available for dividends 
our board of directors is authorized by our certificate of incorporation to determine the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and to authorize the issuance of shares of any such series on such terms as our board of directors may approve 
any such issuance could be used to impede an acquisition of our business that our board of directors does not approve  further dilute the equity investments of holders of our common stock and reduce funds available for the payment of dividends to holders of our common stock 
our stock price is likely to be volatile and could drop 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to period to period variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the construction and construction materials industries  relatively low trading volume in our common stock and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market is subject to extreme price fluctuations 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
securities market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
future sales of common stock could adversely affect our stock price 
our issuance of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of  other than million shares held february  by our affiliates  as that term is defined in rule under the securities act of options to purchase million shares of our common stock were outstanding as of december   including options to purchase million shares that were exercisable 
if a substantial number of shares were sold in the public market pursuant to rule or on exercise of options  the trading price of our common stock in the public market could be adversely affected 
delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain anti takeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
section of the delaware general corporation law may make the acquisition of simpson manufacturing co  inc and the removal of incumbent officers and directors more difficult by prohibiting stockholders holding or more of our outstanding voting stock from acquiring simpson manufacturing co  inc without the consent of our board of directors for at least three years from the date they first hold or more of the voting stock 
barclay simpson and his affiliates are not subject to this provision of delaware law with respect to their investment in simpson manufacturing co  inc in addition  our stockholder rights plan has significant anti takeover effects by causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
we are subject to a number of significant risks that might cause our actual results to vary materially from our plans  targets or projections  including lack of market acceptance of new products  failing to develop new products with significant market potential  increased labor costs  including significant increases in worker s compensation insurance premiums and health care benefits  failing to increase  or even maintain  sales and profits  failing to anticipate  appropriately invest in and effectively manage the human  information technology and logistical resources necessary to support the growth of our business  including managing the costs associated with such resources  failing to integrate  leverage and generate expected rates of return on investments  including expansion of existing businesses and expansion through acquisitions  failing to generate sufficient future positive operating cash flows and  if necessary  secure adequate external financing to fund our growth  and interruptions in service by common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels 
if we change significantly the location  nature or extent of some of our manufacturing operations  we may reduce our net income 
if we decide to change significantly the location  nature or extent of a portion of our manufacturing operations  we may need to record an impairment of our goodwill 
our goodwill totaled million at december  recording an impairment of our goodwill correspondingly reduces our net income 
in  for example  we decided to move part of our canadian manufacturing operations to china  and as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million  which materially reduced our net income in other changes or events in the future could further impair our recorded goodwill  which could also materially and adversely affect our profitability 
impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or at any time when events occur that could affect the value of such assets 
to determine whether a goodwill impairment has occurred  we compare fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value 
significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances  such as significant adverse changes in business climate  adverse actions by regulatory authorities  unanticipated competition  loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets  can require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net income and our stockholders equity 
for example  in  our annual impairment test resulted in goodwill impairment charge of million associated with assets acquired in germany and ireland in as part of our european anchor reporting unit  in  our annual impairment test resulted in goodwill impairment charge of million associated with assets acquired in england in as part of our uk reporting unit  and in  our annual impairment test resulted in goodwill impairment charge of million associated with assets acquired in germany in and as part of our germany reporting unit 
the carrying value of each of these reporting units exceeded their respective fair values  primarily due to reduced future expected net cash flows from weakening profit margins 
if current adverse conditions in the home building industry  the financial markets or the economy generally should continue longer than we expect  we may need to take further charges for impairment  which we are not now able to estimate  but which may be substantial 
failure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions  providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the consolidated financial statements  providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization  and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
because of the inherent limitations of internal control  our internal control over financial reporting might not detect or prevent misstatement of our consolidated financial statements 
our growth and entry into new  globally dispersed markets puts significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 
failure of our accounting systems could harm our business and financial results 
we have implemented a commercially available microsoft third party accounting software system  initially focused on replacing our internally developed general ledger and purchasing and payables systems  for use in our operations in the united states  europe and asia 
any errors or defects in  or unavailability of  third party software or our implementation of the systems  could result in errors in our financial statements  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we continue to use our other internally developed accounting systems and they are not able to accommodate our future business needs  or if we find that they or any new systems we may implement contain errors or defects  our business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our international operations may be materially and adversely affected by factors beyond our control 
economic  social and political conditions  laws  practices and customs vary widely among the countries where we produce or sell our products 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to a number of risks and potential costs  including  for example  lower profit margins  less protection of intellectual property and economic  political and social uncertainty in some countries 
our sales and profits depend  in part  on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that effectively anticipate and manage these and other risks in the countries where we do business 
these and other risks may materially and adversely affect our operations in any particular country and our business as a whole 
inflation in emerging markets also makes our products more expensive there and increases the market and credit risks to which we are exposed 
our international operations depend on our successful management of our subsidiaries outside of the united states 
we conduct most of our international business through wholly owned subsidiaries 
managing distant subsidiaries and fully integrating them into our business is challenging 
we cannot directly supervise every aspect of the operations of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states 
as a result  we rely on local managers and staff 
cultural factors and language differences can result in misunderstandings among internationally dispersed personnel 
the risk that unauthorized conduct may go undetected may be greater in subsidiaries outside of the united states 
these problems could adversely affect our sales and profits 
failure to comply with export  import  and sanctions laws and regulations could affect us materially and adversely 
we are subject to a number of export  import and economic sanction regulations  including the international traffic in arms regulations the itar  the export administration regulations the ear and us sanction regulations administered by the us department of treasury  office of foreign assets ofac 
foreign governments where we have operations also implement export  import and sanction laws and regulations 
if we do not obtain all necessary import and export licenses required by applicable export and import regulations  including the itar and the ear  we may be subject to fines  penalties and other regulatory action by governmental authorities  including  among other things  having our export or import privileges suspended 
if we conduct business with any countries  entities or individuals sanctioned by ofac or any equivalent foreign regulation or law  or otherwise fail to comply in any manner with applicable sanction regulations or laws  we may be subject to fines  penalties and other regulatory action 
even if our policies and procedures for exports  imports and sanction regulations comply  but our employees fail or neglect to follow them in all respects  we might incur similar liability 
any change in applicable export  import or sanction laws or regulations or any legal or regulatory violations could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
our manufacturing facilities in china complicate our inventory management 
we maintain manufacturing capability in various parts of the world  in part to allow us to serve our customers with prompt delivery of needed products 
such customer service is a significant factor in our efforts to compete with larger companies that have greater resources than we have 
in recent years  we have substantially expanded our manufacturing in china 
much of the output of our manufacturing in china is and will be intended for export to other parts of asia and elsewhere 
because of the unusually great distances between our manufacturing facilities in china and the markets to which the products made there will be shipped  we may have difficulty providing adequate service to our customers  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage 
our attempts to provide prompt delivery may necessitate that in china we produce and keep on hand substantially more inventory of finished products than would otherwise be needed 
inventory fluctuations can materially and adversely affect our margins  cash flow and profits 
if we fail to keep pace with advances in our industry or fail to persuade customers to adopt new products we introduce  customers may not buy our products  which would adversely affect our sales and profits 
constant development of new technologies and techniques  frequent new product introductions and strong price competition characterize the construction industry 
the first company to introduce a new product or technique to the market gains a competitive advantage 
our future growth depends  in part  on our ability to develop products that are more effective or safer or incorporate emerging technologies better than our competitors products 
sales of our existing products may decline rapidly if a competitor were to introduce superior products  or even if we announce a new product of our own 
if we fail to make sufficient investments in research and development or if we focus on technologies that do not lead to better products  our current and planned products could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products 
if we fail to manufacture our products economically and market them successfully  our sales and profits would be materially and adversely affected 
changes in accounting standards could materially and adversely affect our financial results 
the accounting rules applicable to public companies are subject to frequent revision 
future changes in accounting standards  guidance and interpretations could require us to change the way we measure revenue  expense or balance sheet amounts  which could result in material and adverse change to our reported results of operations or financial condition 
climate change could materially and adversely affect our business 
scientific reports indicate that  as a result of human activity temperatures around the world have been increasing and are likely to continue to increase as a result of increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds  the frequency and severity of storms and flooding are likely to increase  severe weather is likely to occur in places where the climate has historically been more mild  and average sea levels have risen and are likely to rise more  threatening worldwide coastal development 
we cannot predict the effects that these phenomena may have on our business 
they might  for example depress or reverse economic development  reduce the demand for construction  increase the cost and reduce the availability of fresh water  destroy forests  increasing the cost and reducing the availability of wood products used in construction  increase the cost and reduce the availability of raw materials and energy  increase the cost of capital  increase the cost and reduce the availability of insurance covering damage from natural disasters  lead to claims regarding the content or adequacy of our public disclosures  and lead to new laws and regulations that increase our expenses and reduce our sales 
any of these consequences  and other consequences of climate change that we do not foresee  could materially and adversely affect our sales  profits and financial condition 
we are subject to us and international tax laws that could affect our financial results 
we conduct international operations through our subsidiaries 
tax laws affecting international operations are complex and subject to change 
our income tax liabilities in the different countries where we operate depend in part on internal settlement prices and administrative charges among us and our subsidiaries 
these arrangements require us to make judgments with which tax authorities may disagree 
tax authorities may impose additional tariffs  duties  taxes  penalties and interest on us 
for example  we manufacture steel products in foreign countries for importation into the us and other countries  and government agencies may impose substantial prospective or retroactive tariffs on such products 
transactions that we have arranged in light of current tax rules could have material and adverse consequences if tax rules change  and changes in tax rules or imposition of any new or increased tariffs  duties and taxes could materially and adversely affect our sales  profits and financial condition 
contracts that we file as exhibits to our public reports contain recitals  representations and warranties that may not be factually correct 
the parties to any agreement or other instrument that we file as an exhibit to this or any other report did not necessarily intend that any recital  representation  warranty or other statement of purported fact in the instrument establishes or confirms any fact  even if it is worded as such 
the parties generally intended such statements to allocate contractual risk between the parties  and the statements often are subject to standards of materiality that differ from the standards applicable to our reports 
in addition  such statements may have been qualified by other materials that we have not filed with or incorporated by reference into this or any other report or document 
such exhibits should be read in the context of our other disclosures in our reports 
we believe the text of each of our reports was complete and correct in all material respects when we filed it 
if we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption  cyber based attacks or network security breaches  our operations could be disrupted 
we depend on information technology networks and systems  including the internet  to process  transmit and store electronic information 
we depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and our subsidiaries  customers and suppliers 
security breaches of this infrastructure could create system disruptions  shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
security breaches could disrupt our operations  and we could suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information

item legal proceedings 
from time to time  the company is involved in various legal proceedings and other matters arising in the normal course of business 
the resolution of claims and litigation is subject to inherent uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
the company s policy with regard to environmental liabilities is to accrue for future environmental assessments and remediation costs when information becomes available that indicates that it is probable that the company is liable for any related claims and assessments and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
the company does not believe that these environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
corrosion  hydrogen embrittlement  cracking  material hardness  wood pressure treating chemicals  misinstallations  misuse  design and assembly flaws  manufacturing defects  environmental conditions or other factors can contribute to failure of fasteners  connectors  anchors  adhesives and tools 
on occasion  some of the fasteners and connectors that the company sells have failed  although the company has not incurred any material liability resulting from those failures 
the company attempts to avoid such failures by establishing and monitoring appropriate product specifications  manufacturing quality control procedures  inspection procedures and information on appropriate installation methods and conditions 
the company subjects its products to extensive testing  with results and conclusions published in company catalogues and on its websites

the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere herein 
overview the company designs  manufactures and sells building construction products that are of high quality and performance  easy to use and cost effective for customers 
it operates in three business segments determined by geographic region  north america  europe and asia pacific 
the north american segment sells both wood and concrete construction products and has been highly dependent on housing starts 
the company has made efforts to be less dependent on new housing construction by expanding its line of concrete construction products 
the european segment also sells both wood and concrete construction products and until recently relied primarily on wood construction products for its success 
the recent european acquisition of s p clever and its concrete construction products have contributed to nearly all of the european segment s sales growth compared to in september  the company decided to discontinue manufacturing and selling heavy duty mechanical anchors in europe to focus on other concrete construction products such as its light and medium duty anchors and products sold by fox industries and s p clever 
the asia pacific segment sold both wood and concrete construction products in nearly equal amounts in both and with the recent acquisition of fox industries in north america and s p clever in europe  the company believes its sales of concrete construction products should grow in the asia pacific segment 
the company generally manufactures products and incurs costs in the areas where sales occur 
therefore  for each of the company s foreign operations the local currency is the functional currency and each foreign operation transacts primarily in its functional currency 
the company does not currently plan to enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rates 
the administrative all other segment primarily includes expenses such as self insured workers compensation claims for certain members of management  stock based compensation for certain members of management  interest expense  foreign exchange gains or losses and income tax expense  as well as revenues and expenses related to real estate activities  such as rental income and depreciation expense on the company s facility in vacaville  california  which the company has leased to a third party for a year term expiring in august the company experienced net sales growth from to primarily from higher volumes  partly due to acquisitions  and increased pricing 
the company s net income in increased from but is down from the following are the more significant developments in the company s performance since net sales increased to million in from million in  reflecting improved economic conditions primarily in north america and additional net sales of million from to the north american acquisitions and of million from the european acquisition 
net sales increased in from in all regions of the united states  with an above average rate of increase in the southeast region of the country  and net sales to contractor distributers and lumber dealers increased significantly over the same period 
overall  home center sales in decreased from their level and were comparable to their level  due to the loss of a customer  although sales to the home depot increased from sales to the home depot exceeded of the company s consolidated net sales in the years ended december   and see item a risk factors and note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
net sales also increased in from in the european and asia pacific segments  with above average increases in the asia pacific segment 
net sales increases in north america and europe segments were partly due to the acquisitions of certain assets of cgmi  formerly called socom sa  a french company socom  in the assets of fox industries  inc fox industries  a maryland company  in december the assets of automatic stamping  llc  and automatic stamping auxiliary services  llc  both north carolina limited liability companies collectively automatic stamping  in december  and s p clever reinforcement ag and s p clever international ag  both companies incorporated under the laws of switzerland collectively s p clever  in january gross profit margin decreased from in to in  with wood construction products representing of total sales in  down from of total sales in the overall gross profit margin was negatively affected by increased sales of concrete construction products  which have lower profit margins and higher material costs as compared to wood construction products 
the gross profit margin differential between wood construction products and concrete construction products narrowed from in to in operating expenses increased to million  of sales  in from million  of sales in  primarily due to acquisitions  which increased the number of employees since  research and development expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses 
retailers and distributors have consolidated over time  both providing opportunities for growth and exposing simpson strong tie to potential over dependence with the increasing size and importance of individual customers 
the loss of any of the larger home centers and distributors as customers would have a material adverse effect on sst  unless and until either such customers are replaced or sst makes the necessary adjustments if possible to compensate for the loss of business

the increase in european segment net sales accounted for of the overall company increase and resulted from the acquisition of s p clever and a slight price increase partly offset by reduced sales volumes due to difficult economic conditions  and unfavorable currency translations of approximately million 
net sales in the asia pacific segment  although relatively small  have increased as the company continued expanding its presence in the region 
asia pacific net sales were not materially affected by currency translations

the gross profit margin differential between wood construction products and concrete construction products increased from in to in the north american segment accounted for of the overall increase in gross profit with wood construction products representing of total north american segment s net sales in  down from in the decreased gross profit margin was due primarily to higher material costs as a percentage of net sales  increased concrete construction product sales  which have a lower gross profit margin than wood construction product sales  and greater price competition 
wood construction product sales represented of the european segment s net sales in down from in the decreased gross profit margin was primarily due to charges resulting from the decision to discontinue manufacturing heavy duty mechanical anchors made at the company s facility in ireland and selling those products in europe 
the charges related to the closure of the irish facility and discontinuing the sale of heavy duty anchor products in the european segment 
the charges included severance costs of million  loss on sale of inventory of million and accelerated depreciation of million 
the company continues to face uncertainty in the cost and availability of steel 
if steel prices increase and the company is not able to maintain its prices or increase them sufficiently  the company s margins could deteriorate further 
research and development and other engineering expense research and development and other engineering expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to additional professional fees of million for truss software development  personnel costs of million for additional employees and pay rate increases and stock based compensation of million research and development and other engineering expense attributable to the north american segment increased million  including professional fees of million and personnel costs of million 
none of the changes in the other segments was individually material 
selling expense selling expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to additional personnel costs of million  resulting from the recent north american and european acquisitions and expansion in the asia pacific segment  additional employees  increased pay rates and stock based compensation of million  legal and professional fees of million and promotional costs of million 
selling expenses attributable to the north america segment increased million  including increases in personnel costs of million  stock based compensation of million  promotional costs of million and professional fees of million

amortization expense increased million and depreciation expense increased million primarily due to the recent acquisitions in both north america and europe 
the remaining increases in general and administrative expenses included million in stock based compensation  million in computer hardware  software and support and the remainder in various other expenses 
these increases were partly offset by a net decrease in professional and legal fees of million  although professional and legal fees increased by million in the european segment due to the acquisition and the closure of the ireland facility  and a decrease in cash profit sharing of million due to lower operating income 
general and administrative expense attributable to the north american segment decreased million  including decreases in profession and legal fees of million and cash profit sharing of million  partly offset by increases in depreciation expense of million  amortization expense of million  personnel costs of million  computer hardware  software and support of million and stock based compensation of million 
general and administrative expense attributable to the european segment increased million  including increases in personnel costs of million  amortization expense of million  professional and legal fees of million and stock based compensation of million  partly offset by a decrease in cash profit sharing of million 
closure of the ireland facility also contributed to the increased general and administrative expense attributable to the european segment  which included amortization expense of million  severance costs of million and legal and professional fees of million

general and administrative expense attributable to the admin all other segment decreased million including an increase in stock based compensation of million  offset by decreases in cash profit sharing of million and various other items 
impairment of goodwill the impairment charge of million taken in resulting from the company s annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of was associated with assets in germany that were acquired in and and with the germany reporting unit 
the germany reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  exceeded the fair value  primarily due to reduced future expected net cash flows from weakening profit margins due to european economic conditions  specifically in germany 
the goodwill associated with the germany reporting unit is fully impaired 
the method to determine the fair value of the germany reporting unit was a discounted cash flow model 
the company s annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in an impairment charge of million associated with the uk reporting unit 
the germany and uk reporting units are associated with the european segment

stock based compensation the company estimates that the pre tax stock based compensation expense for will be approximately million for stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards in through and restricted stock unit awards in this amount does not include the service inception charge for restricted stock units  if any  that may be awarded in provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was for the provision for income tax expense decreased primarily due to the realization of a million tax benefit resulting from the worthless stock deduction for its investment in the company s irish subsidiary 
the company also had nondeductible items such as goodwill impairment and foreign losses for which no tax benefit was recorded 
excluding these factors  the effective tax rate would have been approximately

provision for income taxes the effective tax rate was in  as compared to in  primarily due to improved operations in in countries where valuation allowances had been recorded against tax losses 
in addition  the effective tax rate in was higher because of a goodwill impairment for which no tax benefit was recognized 
the change in the provision for income taxes was attributable to the north american and asia pacific segments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the critical accounting policies described below affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
if the company s business conditions change or if it uses different assumptions or estimates in the application of these and other accounting policies  the company s future results of operations could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value market 
cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition  as follows raw materials and purchased finished goods principally valued at cost determined on a weighted average basis and in process products and finished goods cost of direct materials and labor plus attributable overhead based on a normal level of activity 
the company applies net realizable value and obsolescence to the gross value of inventory 
the company estimates net realizable value based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal 
the company impairs slow moving products by comparing inventories on hand to projected demand 
if on hand supply of a product exceeds projected demand or if the company believes the product is no longer marketable  the product is considered obsolete inventory 
the company revalues obsolete inventory to its net realizable value 
the company has consistently applied this methodology 
the company believes that this approach is prudent and makes suitable impairments for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
when impairments are established  a new cost basis of the inventory is created 
unexpected change in market demand  building codes or buyer preferences could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to recognize more obsolete inventory 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete  net of applicable provision for discounts  returns and incentives  whether actual or estimated  based on the company s experience 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the sales agreement or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer  collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
the company s general shipping terms are fob shipping point  where title is transferred and revenue is recognized when the products are shipped to customers 
when the company sells fob destination point  title is transferred and the company recognizes revenue on delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing after market repair and maintenance  engineering activities  software license sales and service and lease income  though significantly less than of net sales and not material to the consolidated financial statements  are recognized as the services are completed or the software products and services are delivered 
if actual costs of sales returns  incentives and discounts were to significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance  the company s sales would be adversely affected 
business combinations the company recognizes separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
while the company uses its best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  the company s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  the company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
on the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  the company records any subsequent adjustments to its consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for business combinations requires the company s management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets 
although the company believes that the assumptions and estimates it has made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets that the company has acquired include future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired unpatented technologies and patents  the acquired company s brand and competitive position and assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
for a given acquisition  the company may identify pre acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend its review and evaluation of these pre acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date to obtain sufficient information to assess whether the company includes these contingencies as a part of the purchase price allocation and  if so  to determine their estimated amounts 
if the company determines that a pre acquisition contingency that is not income tax related is probable and estimable as of the acquisition date  the company records its best estimate for such a contingency as a part of the preliminary purchase price allocation 
the company often continues to gather information for and evaluate its pre acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period 
if the company changes the amounts recorded or identifies additional pre acquisition contingencies during the measurement period  such amounts are included in the purchase price allocation during the measurement period and  subsequently  in the company s results of operations 
in addition  the company estimates uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination initially as of the acquisition date 
the company reevaluates these items quarterly with any adjustments to its preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if the company is within the measurement period 
the company continues to collect information to determine estimated values 
subsequent to the measurement period or the company s final determination of the uncertain tax positions estimated value or tax related valuation allowances  whichever comes first  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect the company s provision for income taxes in its consolidated statement of operations and could have a material effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 
goodwill impairment testing the company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter for the company 
the company also reviews goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or disposition or relocation of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
the reporting unit level is generally one level below the operating segment  which is at the country level  except in the united states and australia and except for s p clever 
the company determined that the united states reporting unit includes four components northwest united states  southwest united states  northeast united states and southeast united states collectively the us components 
the company aggregates the us components into a single reporting unit because management concluded that they are economically similar and that the goodwill is recoverable from the us components working in concert 
the us components are economically similar because of a number of factors  including selling similar products to the shared customers and sharing assets and services such as intellectual property  manufacturing assets for certain products  research and development projects  manufacturing processes  management of inventory excesses and shortages and administrative services 
these activities are managed centrally at the us components level and costs are allocated among the four us components 
the company determined that the australia reporting unit includes three components australia  new zealand and south africa collectively the au components 
the company aggregates the au components into a single reporting unit because management concluded that they are economically similar and that the goodwill is recoverable from the au components working in concert 
the au components are economically similar because of a number of factors  including that new zealand and south africa operate as extensions of their australian parent company selling similar products and sharing assets and services such as intellectual property  manufacturing assets for certain products  management of inventory excesses and shortages and administrative services 
these activities are managed centrally at the au components level and costs are allocated among the au components 
the company determined that the s p clever reporting unit includes seven components s p switzerland  s p poland  s p austria  s p the netherland  s p portugal  s p germany and s p france collectively the s p components 
the company aggregates the s p components into a single reporting unit because management concluded that they are economically similar and that the goodwill is recoverable from the s p components working in concert 
the s p components are economically similar because of a number of factors  including sharing assets and services such as intellectual property  manufacturing assets for certain products  research and development projects  manufacturing processes  management of inventory excesses and shortages and administrative services 
these activities are managed centrally at the s p components level and costs are allocated among the s p components 
for some reporting units  the company may first assess qualitative factors related to the goodwill of the reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two step impairment test 
if the company judges that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill  no further testing is required 
if the company judges that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill  management will perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  management compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value calculation uses a discounted cash flow model and may be supplemented by market approaches if information is readily available 
if the company judges that the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  including goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  a second step of the impairment test must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the company judges that the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  the company would record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the implied fair value of the goodwill and the carrying value 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived purchased intangible asset is a judgment involving significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  and future economic and market conditions level fair value inputs 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable  but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates
