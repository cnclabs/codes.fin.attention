table of contents item a 
risk factors 
an investment in bd involves a variety of risks and uncertainties 
the following describes some of the significant risks that could adversely affect bd s business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our operations 
in recent years  we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions  particularly in the us and western europe 
further deterioration in the global economic environment may result in decreased demand for our products and services  increased competition  downward pressure on the prices for our products  longer sales cycles  and slower adoption of new technologies 
we anticipate that these industry conditions will continue for the foreseeable future 
weakening macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers  and there can be no assurances that bd will not experience any interruptions in supply in the future 
we have also experienced delays in collecting receivables in certain countries in western europe  and we may experience similar delays in these and other regions experiencing liquidity problems 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
about of our fiscal year revenues were derived from international operations  and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the us in the future 
the revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the united states may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
a discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in item 
 management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations 
any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks 
changes in reimbursement practices of third party payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold 
our sales depend  in part  on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities  private insurers and other third party payers for the costs of our products 
the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third party payers  which can vary among public and private sources and by country  may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction 
reimbursement rates can also affect the acceptance rate of new technologies 
and products 
legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states or abroad  or changes in reimbursement rates by private payers  could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using bd products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products  which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products 
for example  the center for medicare and medicaid services cms has proposed a series of changes to the way diagnostic tests are reimbursed that would significantly cut reimbursement rates  including for some pathology tests that use flow cytometry 
see third party reimbursement under item business 
federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 
the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca was enacted in march under the ppaca  beginning in  medical device manufacturers  such as bd  pay a excise tax on us sales of certain medical devices 
for fiscal  this excise tax which impacted only three quarters of the fiscal year was million 
we cannot predict with any certainty what other impact the ppaca may have on our business 
the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals  clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies  and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures 
these factors  in turn  could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure 
it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursement rates for our products 
other provisions in the law may significantly change the practice of health care and could adversely affect aspects of our business 
while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the united states  the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of bd s products remains uncertain 

table of contents efforts to reduce the us federal deficit could adversely affect our results of operations 
as part of the budget control act passed in august to extend the federal debt limit and reduce government spending  trillion in automatic spending cuts known as sequestration over the next decade have gone into effect  beginning in  and will remain in effect in the absence of further legislative action 
half of the automatic reductions will come from lowering the caps imposed on non defense discretionary spending and cutting domestic entitlement programs  including reductions in payments to medicare providers 
government research funding has also been reduced as a result of sequestration 
such reductions in government healthcare spending or research funding could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure 
further  there is ongoing uncertainty regarding the federal budget and federal spending levels  including the possible impacts of a failure to increase the debt ceiling 
any us government default on its debt could have broad macroeconomic effects that could  among other things  raise our borrowing costs 
any future shutdown of the federal government or failure to enact annual appropriations could also have a material adverse impact on our business 
consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect bd s future revenues and operating income 
the medical technology industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation 
as a result of this consolidation  competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased 
in addition  group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers  which has also placed pricing pressure on medical device suppliers 
further consolidation in the industry could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 
cost volatility could adversely affect our operations 
our results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials  components  freight and energy 
in particular  bd purchases supplies of resins  which are oil based components used in the manufacture of certain products 
any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results 
increases in the price of oil can also increase bd s costs for packaging and transportation 
new laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy costs and the costs of certain raw materials and components 
we may not be able to offset increases in these costs through other cost reductions 
breaches of our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we rely on information technology systems to process  transmit  and store electronic information in our day to day operations 
like many multinational corporations  our information technology systems have been subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes  unauthorized access attempts  and cyber or phishing attacks  and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future 
we also store certain information with third parties that could be subject to these types of attacks 
these attacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being lost or stolen  disruption of our operations  and other negative consequences  such as increased costs for security measures or remediation costs  and diversion of management attention 
recently  we became aware that certain of our information systems have been compromised by an external threat 
our ongoing investigation by an independent third party security firm has not revealed the loss of information that would otherwise result in material interruption of or damage to our information systems  or material disruption of our operations 
while we will continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect future cyber incidents  cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent  and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly 
there can be no assurances that our protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a significant impact on our business 
bd s future growth is dependent upon the development of new products  and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed 
a significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on products that deliver greater benefits to patients  healthcare workers and researchers 
the development of these products requires significant investment in research and development  clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
the results of our 
table of contents product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors  including bd s ability to anticipate customer needs  innovate  and develop new products  complete clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the united states and abroad  manufacture products in a cost effective manner  obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products  and gain and maintain market approval of our products 
in addition  patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product 
there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility  obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 
we cannot guarantee that any of bd s strategic acquisitions  investments or alliances will be successful 
as part of our strategy to increase revenue growth  we seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions  investments and alliances 
such transactions are inherently risky 
the success of any acquisition  investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors  including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business 
there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful 
the medical technology industry is very competitive 
the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological change 
in addition  we face changing customer preferences and requirements  including increased customer demand for more environmentally friendly products 
we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features  clinical outcomes  price  services and other factors 
we face this competition from a wide range of companies 
these include large medical device companies  some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do  and firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets 
other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well 
in some instances  competitors  including pharmaceutical companies  also offer  or are attempting to develop  alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device 
the development of new or improved products  processes or technologies by other companies such as needle free injection technology may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive 
the entry into the market of manufacturers located in china and other low cost manufacturing locations has also created pricing pressure  particularly in developing markets 
some competitors have also established manufacturing sites or have contracted with suppliers located in these countries as a means to lower their costs 
the international operations of bd s business may subject bd to certain business risks 
the majority of our sales come from our operations outside the united states  and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets  especially in emerging markets 
bd s foreign operations subject bd to certain risks  including the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange discussed above  the effects of local economic conditions  foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements  local product preferences and product requirements  difficulty in establishing  staffing and managing foreign operations  differing labor regulations  changes in tax laws  potential political instability  trade barriers  weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  trade protection and restrictions on the transfer of capital across borders 
the success of our operations outside the united states depends  in part  on our ability to acquire or form and maintain alliances with local companies and make necessary infrastructure enhancements to  among other things  our production facilities and sales and distribution networks 
in addition  our international operations are governed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar anti corruption laws 
global enforcement of anti corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years  with more enforcement proceedings by us and foreign governmental agencies 
while we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws  our international operations create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments by employees  consultants  sales agents or distributors 
any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government scrutiny  severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities  and negatively affect our reputation 

table of contents under the us tax code  we may also be subject to additional taxation to the extent we repatriate earnings from our foreign operations to the us in the event we require more capital in the united states than is generated by our us operations to fund acquisitions or other activities and elect to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions  our effective tax rate may be higher as a result 
reductions in customers research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our bd biosciences segment 
our bd biosciences segment sells products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  government laboratories and private foundations 
research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions 
a number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from us government agencies  such as the us national institutes of health nih and agencies in other countries 
the level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable 
there have been instances where nih grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods 
the availability of governmental research funding may also continue to be adversely affected by the current economic conditions and  as described above  governmental spending reductions 
any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products 
a reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components would adversely affect bd s manufacturing operations and related product sales 
bd purchases many different types of raw materials and components 
certain raw materials primarily related to the bd biosciences segment and components are not available from multiple sources 
in addition  for quality assurance  cost effectiveness and other reasons  bd elects to purchase certain raw materials and components from sole suppliers 
the supply of these materials can be disrupted for a number of reasons  including economic conditions as described above 
while we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply  no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
in addition  due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers  we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost 
the termination  reduction or interruption in supply of these sole sourced raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products 
interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect bd s future revenues and operating income 
we have manufacturing sites all over the world 
in some instances  the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants 
weather  natural disasters including pandemics  terrorism  political change  failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures  equipment malfunction  environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products  resulting in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers 
bd is subject to lawsuits 
bd is or has been a defendant in a number of lawsuits  including purported class action lawsuits for  among other things  alleged antitrust violations and suits alleging patent infringement  and could be subject to additional lawsuits in the future 
a more detailed description of these lawsuits is contained in item legal proceedings 
given the uncertain nature of litigation generally  we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party 
in view of these uncertainties  we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and  to the extent available  excess liability insurance 
any such future charges  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on bd s results of operations and cash flows 
bd is subject to extensive regulation 
bd s operations are global and are affected by various state  federal and international healthcare  environmental  antitrust  anti corruption  fraud and abuse including anti kickback and false claims laws and employment laws 
violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions  including substantial fines 
table of contents and  in some cases  exclusion from participation in health care programs such as medicare and medicaid 
bd is also subject to extensive regulation by the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  by comparable agencies in foreign countries  and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies 
most of bd s products must receive clearance or approval from the fda or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold 
the process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may take a significant period of time and require the expenditure of substantial resources  and these have been increasing due to increased requirements from the fda for supporting data for submissions 
the process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of the products 
governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration  labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or re register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries 
once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product  there is an obligation to ensure that all applicable fda and other regulatory requirements continue to be met 
following the introduction of a product  these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance 
our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices  adverse event reporting  clinical trial and other requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production  marketing or sale of our products and result in fines  delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances  closure of manufacturing sites  seizures or recalls of products and damage to our reputation 
recent changes in enforcement practice by the fda and other agencies have resulted in increased enforcement activity  which increases the compliance risk for bd and other companies in our industry 
product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 
the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks 
manufacturing or design defects  unapproved use of our products  or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events 
these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries  and could result  in certain cases  in the removal of a product from the market 
a recall could result in significant costs  as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 
personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us 
in some circumstances  such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products 
we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system 
we are engaged in a project to upgrade our enterprise resource planning erp system 
our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records  record transactions  provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements 
the implementation of the new erp system has required  and will continue to require  the investment of significant financial and human resources 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully complete the implementation of the new erp system without experiencing difficulties 
any disruptions  delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders  ship products  provide services and customer support  send invoices and track payments  fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 
our operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets 
many of bd s businesses rely on patent  trademark and other intellectual property assets 
these intellectual property assets  in the aggregate  are of material importance to our business 
bd can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations  legal challenges or governmental action 
patents attained by competitors  particularly as patents on our products expire  may also adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  competitors may claim that bd products infringe upon their intellectual property  and resolving any intellectual property claim can be costly and time consuming 
the loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings  financial condition or cash flows 

table of contents natural disasters  war and other events could adversely affect bd s future revenues and operating income 
natural disasters including pandemics  war  terrorism  labor disruptions and international conflicts  and actions taken by the united states and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events  could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the united states and in areas outside of the united states in which we operate 
these events could result in decreased demand for our products  adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities  or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers 
we need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive 
our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees  including people in technical  marketing  sales and research positions 
competition for experienced employees  particularly for persons with specialized skills  can be intense 
bd s ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors  including compensation and benefits  work location and work environment 
if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees  our business could be adversely affected

item legal proceedings 
given the uncertain nature of litigation generally  bd is not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which bd is a party 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  bd establishes accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable in the case of environmental matters  without considering possible third party recoveries 
in view of the uncertainties discussed below  bd could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and  to the extent available  excess liability insurance 
in the opinion of management  any such future charges  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on bd s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows 
bd was named as a defendant in five purported class action suits brought on behalf of distributors and other entities that purchase bd s products the distributor plaintiffs  alleging that bd violated federal antitrust laws  resulting in the charging of higher prices for bd s products to the plaintiffs and other purported class members 
these actions were consolidated under the caption in re hypodermic products antitrust litigation 
pursuant to a settlement agreement bd entered into with the distributor plaintiffs in these actions on april  and following approval by the district court on a preliminarily basis in november and on a final basis in april  bd has paid million in exchange for a release by all potential class members of the direct purchaser claims under federal antitrust laws related to the products and acts enumerated in the complaint  and a dismissal of the case with prejudice  insofar as it relates to direct purchaser claims 
bd is also named as a defendant in the following purported class action suits brought on behalf of indirect purchasers of bd s products  such as hospitals and retailers the hospital plaintiffs  alleging that bd violated federal and state antitrust laws  resulting in the charging of higher prices for bd s products to the plaintiffs and other purported class members

table of contents revenue growth was primarily driven by instrument and reagent sales in emerging markets  partially offset by declines in western europe 
revenues in the united states in of billion increased over the prior year and reflected growth from all segments 
ongoing weaker demand in the diagnostics segment s women s health and cancer platform continued to unfavorably impact us revenue growth in international revenues in of billion increased  which reflected an estimated impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of 
international revenues for reflected growth from all segments  including growth attributable to emerging markets  as well as strong sales of safety engineered products 
sales in the united states of safety engineered devices grew to billion in from billion in international sales of safety engineered devices grew to million in compared with million in  which included an estimated negative impact due to unfavorable foreign currency translation 
international safety engineered device revenue growth continues to be driven by strong sales in the medical segment  with the largest growth in emerging markets

our ability to sustain our long term growth will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to expand our core business including geographical expansion  develop innovative new products  and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness 
the healthcare industry continues to face a challenging economic environment 
the current economic conditions and other circumstances have resulted in pricing pressures for some of our products 
continued uncertainty in the research spending environment could adversely impact our biosciences segment 
in other areas of our us business  healthcare utilization is stable but constrained 
additionally  we have experienced constrained healthcare utilization in europe due to continued macroeconomic challenges in that region  although we currently view the environment as stable 
in addition to the economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere  numerous other factors can affect our ability to achieve our goals including  without limitation  increased competition and healthcare reform initiatives 
for example  the us patient protection affordable care act contains the medical device excise tax that  effective january   imposes a tax on certain us sales of medical devices 
the impact of this tax on our results is further discussed below

net cash inflows from divestitures of million represented the sale of biosciences discovery labware unit  excluding its advanced bioprocessing platform 
also  we continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends 
during  we repurchased million of our common stock and paid cash dividends of million 
we face currency exposure each reporting period that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period 
we evaluate our results of operations on both an as reported and a foreign currency neutral basis  which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we calculate foreign currency neutral percentages by converting our current period local currency financial results using the prior period foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current period reported results 
from time to time  we may purchase forward contracts and options to partially protect against adverse foreign exchange rate movements 
gains or losses on our derivative instruments are largely offset by the gains or losses on the underlying hedged transactions 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes
