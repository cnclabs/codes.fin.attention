critical accounting policies and estimates refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the company s significant accounting policies referenced  as applicable  to other notes 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with its audit committee 
see note to consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap 
the following section below provides information about certain critical accounting policies that are important to the consolidated financial statements and that require significant management assumptions and judgments 
business combinations the application of purchase accounting to a business acquisition requires that the company identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each 
the company estimates the fair value of purchase consideration in each business combination using an acceptable valuation methodology which may include an income  market and or cost approach 
the company assigns a provisional value on the date of purchase and engages qualified third party valuation professionals to estimate the fair value of significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
purchase consideration is often paid to the seller in the form of cash  seller financed promissory notes and or shares of common stock that may or may not contain a contingency often tied to future financial performance targets 
the company generally assesses the estimated fair value of contingent obligations using a probability weighted income approach discounted cash flow valuation technique which requires the use of observable and unobservable inputs 
fluctuations in the fair value of contingent obligations are impacted by two unobservable inputs  management s estimate of the probability of the acquired company meeting the operating performance target and the estimated discount rate a rate that approximates the company s weighted average cost of capital 
significant increases decreases in either of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement 
fair value is assessed for contingent obligations on a quarterly basis until such contingencies have been resolved and any changes in fair value are recorded as a gain or loss on change in fair value of contingent obligations within general and administrative expense 
the company revised its provisional value of contingent consideration paid related to the avalon global solutions  inc ags business combination to reflect additional information existing at the date of the ags purchase that affected the payout probabilities used in our calculation of fair value and working capital adjustments finalized during fiscal the company decreased its contingent obligation provisional value from million to a final fair value million as of december  the company reassessed the fair value of contingent consideration during the year ended december  and recorded a non cash gain of approximately million to reflect a reduction in the fair value of its contingent obligation due to non attainment of certain financial performance targets in fiscal and changes in the financial performance based on revised internal forecasts 
the fair value of this contingent obligation will be reassessed quarterly until fiscal year ending december  goodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business combination 
the company recognizes the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights  or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged  either individually or in combination with a related contract  asset or liability 
the company generally assesses the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using an income and market approach  except for internally developed software which is valued using a cost approach 
the fair values of the intangible assets purchased were determined using a combination of valuation techniques 
fluctuations in the fair value of intangibles are impacted by two unobservable inputs  management s five year forecast and the estimated discount rate a rate that approximates the company s weighted average cost of capital 
significant increases decreases in either of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement 
the company had finite lived intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately million as of december  the fair value of intangibles acquired in connection with business combinations continued to generate positive returns above its carrying value 
accordingly  the company has concluded the fair value of its intangibles is not impaired at december  the company could be exposed to increased risk of recoverability to the extent future revenue estimates may not support the recovery of purchased intangible assets 
revenue recognition telecommunications expense management and device management services are delivered on a monthly basis based on a standard fixed pricing scale and sensitive to significant changes in per user or device counts which form the basis for monthly charges 
revenue is recognized upon the completion of the delivery of monthly managed services based on user or device counts or other metrics 
managed services are not interdependent and there are no undelivered elements in these arrangements 
if estimated user or device counts are significantly different from actual counts it could significant affect the calculation of reported monthly managed service fees 
telecommunications carrier invoice management and payment services requires the company to purchase bands of minutes  text messaging and data services from large carriers and optimizes these services for its mobile customers

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired company over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in accordance with gaap  goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually at december and between annual tests if events or circumstances arise  such as adverse changes in the business climate  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company assigns goodwill to its reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing 
a reporting unit is defined as either an operating segment or a business one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available that management regularly reviews 
the goodwill impairment test utilizes a two step approach 
the first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
the company has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting period and proceed to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test and then subsequently resume performing a qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the company bypassed using a qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment testing involves management judgment  requiring an assessment of whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by its fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  such as the market approach earnings multiples or transaction multiples for the industry in which the reporting unit operates or the income approach discounted cash flow methods 
the fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach 
when preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach  the company estimates future cash flows using the reporting unit s internal five year forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate that management believes is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic conditions 
the company then applies a discount rate to discount these future cash flows to arrive at a net present value amount  which represents the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the discount rate applied approximates the expected cost of equity financing  determined using a capital asset pricing model 
the model generates an appropriate discount rate using internal and external inputs to value future cash flows based on the time value of money and the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in an investment 
the company has approximately million of goodwill as of december  the fair value of each of the company s reporting units is above its carrying value  accordingly  the company has concluded its goodwill is not impaired at december  the company could be exposed to increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating results or macroeconomic conditions differ significantly from management s current assumptions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company has not historically maintained a bad debt reserve for its federal government customers 
allowances for doubtful accounts relate to commercial accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable represent management s best estimate of the losses inherent in the company s outstanding trade accounts receivable 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
customer account balances outstanding longer than days are placed with a third party collection agency and a reserve is established 
the company writes off accounts receivable after days or earlier when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
to the extent historical credit experience updated for emerging market trends in credit is not indicative of future performance  actual losses could differ significantly from management s judgments and expectations  resulting in either higher or lower future provisions for losses  as applicable 
the process of determining the allowance for doubtful accounts requires a high degree of judgment 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions 
share based compensation the company issues share based compensation awards to company employees upon which the fair value of awards is subject to significant estimates made by management 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model black scholes model  which uses the assumptions of no dividend yield  risk free interest rates and expected life in years of approximately years 
the option awards are for the period from through expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the expected term of options granted is based on analyses of historical employee termination rates and option exercises 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant 
to the extent historical volatility estimates  risk free interest rates  option terms and forfeiture rates updated for emerging market trends are not indicative of future performance it could differ significantly from management s judgments and expectations on the fair value of similar share based awards  resulting in either higher or lower future compensation expense  as applicable 
the process of determining fair value of share based compensation requires a high degree of judgment 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
since deferred taxes measure the future tax effects of items recognized in the financial statements  certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in making this assessment  management analyzes and estimates the impact of future taxable income  reversing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies 
these assessments are performed quarterly  taking into account any new information 
the company s significant deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards  share based compensation and intangible asset amortization 
should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate ability to realize a deferred tax asset including our utilization of historical net operating losses and share based compensation expense  the company records or adjusts the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts or circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding increase or decrease to the income tax provision 
recently adopted accounting standards updates asu asu update no 
intangibles goodwill and other 
this amendment allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test as described in accounting standards codification topic no 
intangibles goodwill 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting period and proceed to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test and then subsequently resume performing a qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
this amendment no longer permits carry forward of prior year quantitative calculations of a reporting unit fair value 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the company adopted this accounting standard update for fiscal year ended december  and elected to bypass the qualitative assessment 
there were no material impacts to the consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this accounting standard update 
consolidated operating results financial review year ended december  compared to the year ended december  segment operating income consists of the revenues generated by a segment  less the direct costs of revenue and selling  general and administrative costs that are incurred directly by the segment 
unallocated corporate costs include costs related to administrative functions that are performed in a centralized manner that are not attributable to a particular segment 
management does not analyze assets for decision making purposes as it is not a significant factor 
accordingly  information is not available for long lived assets or total assets 
during  we initiated a management reorganization that focused on repositioning key management resources and strategic offerings into one segment  rather than multiple segments 
in  we will continue implementing this reorganization plan and will be managing and reporting our operations as a singular segment in the future 
the following table sets forth selected segment and consolidated operating results and other operating data for the periods indicated 
for the year ended december   managed consulting corporate mobility cyber and support administrative solutions security services services total revenues    income loss from operations    net interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes    net income tax benefit  net income     for the year ended december   managed consulting corporate mobility cyber and support administrative solutions security services services total revenues    income loss from operations   net interest income expense  net other income expense net income before provision for income taxes    net income tax benefit  net income    revenues consolidated revenues for the year ended december  increased to approximately million  an increase of approximately million or  as compared to approximately million in the same period last year 
this increase was a result of revenue growth in all of our segments  which included growth in revenue from customers transitioned over as a result of the asset acquisition of ags of approximately million 
our segment revenue comparison is set forth below our managed mobility solutions segment realized revenues of approximately million  an increase of approximately million or for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million in the same period last year 
excluding revenue growth attributable to customers transitioned over in connection with the ags transaction  we experienced revenue growth of approximately million 
we continued to shift away from lower margin revenue generated from billable reselling of minutes to our federal customers 
we continue to believe that growth strategies to expand our reach in the commercial and state government sectors should provide us with the revenue mix and customer diversification sought to meet our overall growth strategies and manage variability in revenue from federal government contracts 
our cyber security managed solutions segment realized revenues of approximately million  an increase of million or for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million in the same period last year 
our revenue growth materially reflects continuing credentialing managed service sales in connection with the transportation workers identification credentialing twic program 
we believe our credentialing program will expand from continued support and rollout of additional work with various states in support of our first responders initiatives  and other credentialing initiatives in progress 
our consulting and support services segment realized revenues of approximately million  an increase of million or for the year ended december  as compared to million in the same period last year 
our revenue growth in this segment was driven by increases in our technology infrastructure and application consulting services in the commercial sector  as well as increases in product resale s of hardware  software  mobile device and accessory products to commercial and government sector customers 
future performance for this segment may prove erratic from period to period as consulting service and product resale demand is depend upon our customer s technology requirements and planned program roll out periods 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for the year ended december  was approximately million or of revenues as compared to approximately million or of revenues in the same period last year 
cost of revenues increased on a dollar basis due to the addition of ags operations on january  cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues improved overall from to  driven by a higher mix of higher margin services 
we anticipate that our cost of revenues in the long term will trend lower as we continue to pursue revenue growth in the future from higher margin services and optimize the cost to deliver our managed service solutions 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  was approximately million or of revenues  as compared to approximately million or of revenues in the same period last year 
gross profit increased on a dollar basis due to the addition of ags operations on january  and due to a higher mix of higher margin services 
operating expenses sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  was approximately million or of revenues  as compared to approximately million or of revenues in the same period last year 
sales and marketing program expense includes direct and indirect marketing costs and commission payments to commercial business channel partners  which accounted for a significant portion of the increase 
we anticipate increases in sales and marketing expense as we continue to expand our customer acquisition initiatives and expand our capabilities and offerings in the market 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million or of revenues  as compared to approximately million or of revenues in the same period last year 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  includes a non cash gain of approximately million that reflects a reduction in the fair value of a contingent obligation upon remeasurement at the reporting date 
excluding this non cash gain  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  would have been approximately million or of revenues 
general and administrative expenses largely consist of technology infrastructure and support services to manage our customer facing proprietary technology solutions  costs to manage and support out internal facing technology infrastructure  financial management and compliance support  and other general support services to manage our infrastructure and regulatory requirements 
we anticipate temporary increases in general and administrative expense as we functionalize the management of our businesses and streamline our operational systems 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  was approximately  as compared to approximately  in the same period last year 
the increase in depreciation expense was due to increased pool of depreciable assets to support our technology solutions infrastructure 
we anticipate additional infrastructure investments in computer equipment and other hardware to respond to anticipated capacity requirements as we growth our revenue base 
other income expense interest income for the year ended december  was approximately  as compared to approximately  in the same period last year 
this decrease was due to lower amounts of invested cash and cash equivalents in interest bearing accounts as well as the continued low short term interest rates offered by financial institutions 
we had lower amounts of invested cash due to our strategic decisions to reinvest operating cash back into the business to drive our sales and marketing initiatives and operational initiatives 
we do not anticipate any material changes in trends in our interest income given the level of capital committed to support these continued initiatives 
interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately  or of revenues  an increase of approximately  as compared to approximately  or less than of revenues of interest expense in the same period last year 
the overall increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition of ags 
other income for the year ended december  was approximately  as compared to other expenses for the year ended december  of less than  and did not include any significant items 
provision for income taxes income tax benefit for the year ended december  was approximately  as compared to  in the same period last year 
net income as a result of the factors above  the net income for the year ended december  was approximately  as compared to a net income of approximately  in the same period last year 
liquidity and capital the company has  since inception  financed its operations and capital expenditures through the sale of preferred and common stock  seller notes in connection with acquisitions  convertible notes  convertible exchangeable debentures  senior secured loans and the proceeds from the exercise of the warrants related to a convertible exchangeable debenture 
the company s immediate sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  unbilled receivables and access to a working capital credit facility with cardinal bank for up to million 
the company s operating liabilities consist of trade payables and payroll obligations 
the company s operations require working capital to fund planned growth strategies and related initiatives 
at december   the company s net working capital was approximately million as compared to approximately million at december  at december   there were no material commitments for additional acquisitions or capital expenditures  but that could change with the addition of material contract awards in any of our segments 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings against the company s working capital credit facility 
cash provided by operating activities provides an indication of our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our recurring business activities 
for the year ended december  net cash provided by operations was approximately million as compared to approximately million in the same period last year 
the decrease in cash flow from operations compared to the same period last year is driven by receivable billing and collection timing differences on large resale transactions 
cash used in investing activities provides an indication of our long term infrastructure investments 
we make recurring purchases of property and equipment to replace or enhance our hardware and software applications that support customer operations 
we also make investments in software development related to our proprietary telecommunications expense management tools and applications and pki software certificate credentialing managed services 
for the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was approximately million as compared to approximately million in the same period last year 
the decrease in investing activity year over year reflects the impact of timing of periodic pki credentialing software development costs and purchasing decisions to enter into a capital lease arrangements as opposed to financing the current year technology requirements from available cash balances 
cash used in financing activities provides an indication of our equity and debt capital raises and repayment of those obligations 
for the year ended december   cash used in financing activities was approximately million as compared to approximately million in the same period last year 
we utilized our working capital credit facility during the year ended december  to facilitate short term funding post acquisition at widepoint solutions corp 
which acquired the assets of ags while ags customer contracts were being assigned and to fund infrastructure investments 
we repaid our line of credit advances in full with available cash balances and made our scheduled payments for current maturities of term debt during the year ended december  we believe our current cash position and our working capital credit facility are sufficient to meet our minimum requirements for our current business operations 
our business environment is characterized by rapid technological change with periods of high growth and contraction  and is influenced by material events such as mergers and acquisitions that can substantially change our performance and outlook 
constant growth and technological change in our market makes it difficult to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
we believe future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  if any  the timing and extent of spending for new product and service development  strategic acquisition funding and availability of suitable acquisition targets  technological changes in our proprietary software solutions and market acceptance of the company s branded products and service solutions 
over the long term  the company must successfully execute its growth plans to increase profitable revenue and income streams that should generate positive cash flows to sustain adequate liquidity without impairing growth initiatives or requiring the infusion of additional funds from external sources to meet minimum operating requirements  including debt service 
there can be no assurance that additional financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  for future acquisitions and or growth initiatives 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no existing off balance sheet arrangements as defined under sec regulations 
other inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operations  as increased costs to the company have generally been offset by increased prices of products and services sold 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could substantially differ from those estimates 
this report contains forward looking statements setting forth the company s beliefs or expectations relating to future revenues and profitability 
actual results may differ materially from projected or expected results due to changes in the demand for the company s products and services  uncertainties relating to the results of operations  dependence on its major customers  risks associated with rapid technological change and the emerging services market  potential fluctuations in quarterly results  and its dependence on key employees and other risks and uncertainties affecting the technology industry generally 
the company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise
