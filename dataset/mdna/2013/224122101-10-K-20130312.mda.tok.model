item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview craft brew alliance is an independent craft brewer formed by the union of four unique and pioneering craft beer brands redhook ale brewery founded by gordon bowker and paul shipman in in seattle  washington  widmer brothers brewing founded by brothers kurt and rob widmer in in portland  oregon  kona brewing co 
founded by father and son team cameron healy and spoon khalsa in in kona  hawaii  and omission beer internally developed by our brewing team in in portland  oregon 
since our formation  we have focused our business activities on satisfying consumers through the brewing  marketing and selling of high quality craft beers in the united states 
today  as an independent craft brewer  we possess several distinct advantages  unique in the craft beer category 
these advantages derive from the combination of our innovative quality craft beers  the strength of our distinct  authentic brand portfolio  our seamless national distribution and national sales and marketing reach  our financial capabilities as a public company  our owned brew pubs  and our bi coastal breweries 
we proudly brew our craft beers in four company owned breweries including three mainland breweries located in portsmouth  new hampshire  portland  oregon  and the seattle suburb of woodinville  washington  and one hawaii brewery located in kailua kona  hawaii 
we also own and operate a small pilot brewery  primarily used for small batch production and innovative brews  at the rose quarter sports arena in portland  oregon 
we distribute our beers to retailers through independent wholesalers that are aligned with the anheuser busch  llc a b network 
these sales are made pursuant to a master distributor agreement the a b distributor agreement with a b 
our agreement with a b initially allowed us to establish relationships nationwide with these wholesalers 
as a result of this distribution arrangement  we believe that  under alcohol beverage laws in a majority of states  these wholesalers own the exclusive right to distribute our beers in their respective markets if the a b distributor agreement expires or is terminated 
redhook and widmer brothers beers are distributed in all states and kona beers are distributed in states 
omission beer recently became available nationally and we continue to expand into new markets in both the us and internationally 
separate from our a b wholesalers  we maintain an independent sales and marketing organization complete with resources across the key functions of brand management  field marketing  field sales  and national retail sales 
we operate in two segments beer related operations and pubs 
beer related operations include the brewing and sale of craft beers from our five breweries  both domestically and internationally 
pubs operations primarily include our five pubs  four of which are located adjacent to our beer related operations  other merchandise sales  and sales of our beers directly to customers 
following is a summary of our financial results net sales net income number of barrels sold million million million million million million the comparability of our results is impacted by the merger with kona brewing co  inc kbc  which closed october  the kbc merger  and by the sale of our equity interest in fulton street brewery  llc fsb during the second quarter of see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for more detailed information

pubs sales include sales of promotional merchandise and sales of beer directly to customers 
shipments by category shipments by category were as follows in barrels year ended december  shipments shipments increase change change in depletions a b and a b related contract brewing and beer related pubs total year ended december  shipments shipments increase change change in depletions a b and a b related contract brewing and beer related pubs total change in depletions reflects the year over year change in barrel volume sales of beer by wholesalers to retailers 
contract brewing and beer related includes international shipments of our beers 
the increase in sales to a b and a b related in compared to was primarily due to increased volume  higher selling prices for our beers  and a shift in product mix towards bottle and high end product  both of which carry a higher price per unit than draft 
gross sales in was also favorably impacted by a decrease in the per barrel fee associated with sales to a b as a result of an amendment to our a b distributor agreement in may this lower fee level for the period of january through april generated approximate savings of million as compared to the same period in the increase in sales to a b and a b related in compared to was primarily due to an increase in volume  higher selling prices for our beers and a shift in product mix towards bottle and high end product 
gross sales were also favorably impacted by a decrease in the per barrel fee associated with sales to a b as a result of amendments to our a b distributor agreement  which is netted against revenue 
our savings from both the and amendments to the a b distributor agreement totaled approximately million for 
table of contents we estimate that  had the modification to the a b distributor agreement been in place throughout  the increase in sales resulting from the reduced distribution fees would have been approximately million 
the amount of increase in sales realized for future periods may differ from this estimate due to the level  timing and geographic distribution of our shipments to a b 
exclusive of the impact of the favorable change in our per barrel margin fee  the average revenue per barrel on shipments of beer through the a b distribution network increased by in compared to and in compared to  primarily due to pricing increases and a shift in product mix towards both bottle and high end product as mentioned above 
price changes implemented by us have generally followed craft beer market pricing trends 
during  and  we sold  and  respectively  of our beer through a b at wholesale pricing levels 
the increase in contract brewing and beer related sales in compared to was due to an increase in shipments under the arrangement with fsb 
effective september   in the best interest of both parties  we mutually agreed with fsb to end our contract brewing arrangement 
under the termination agreement  we phased out production of fsb branded beers by the end of november utilizing remaining inventory on hand 
in consideration  fsb will pay us  per month through september we recorded  in sales during the period from september  to december  under the terms of the termination agreement 
the increase in contract brewing and beer related sales in compared to was primarily due to an increase in shipments under an existing third party contract and the contribution of shipments under a contract brewing arrangement with fsb  which was entered into in the first quarter of sales to fsb through the contract brewing arrangement  classified in sales  were as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  the overall increase in volume in compared to was primarily driven by our increased sales and marketing efforts  timing of programs and new brand and package introductions  partially offset by a decline in our event volume  which is included in pubs 
the increase in excise taxes in compared to was due to higher shipments in compared to the increase in excise taxes in compared to was driven by three factors i increases in shipments  ii the addition of excise taxes relating to shipments of kona beers that were previously recognized by kona prior to the kbc merger  and iii a marginal tax rate increase after the kbc merger as the combined companies are eligible for only a single excise tax exemption 
also contributing to the increase was an increase in the marginal tax rate for beer produced in washington state  which became effective in the second half of pubs sales increased in compared to primarily due to increased guest counts and pricing in certain markets 
the increase was also attributable to an increase in the number of barrels sold  primarily as a result of the increase in guest counts 
the increase in pubs and other sales in compared to was primarily due to the addition of pub operations acquired with the kbc merger 
prior to the kbc merger  we earned revenue in connection with an alternating proprietorship agreement with kona  including fees for leasing the oregon brewery and sales of raw materials 
subsequent to the kbc merger  any such intercompany activities are eliminated  including the revenues associated with the alternating proprietorship agreement 

table of contents shipments by brand the following table sets forth a comparison of shipments by brand in barrels year ended december  shipments shipments increase decrease change change in depletions widmer brothers kona redhook total year ended december  shipments shipments increase decrease change change in depletions widmer brothers kona redhook total total shipments by brand include international shipments and exclude shipments produced under our contract brewing arrangements 
the decrease in our widmer brothers brand shipments in compared to was primarily due to pressure on our hefeweizen beer which is experiencing competition from large  multi national wheat beer competitors  particularly in draft in california 
partially offsetting this decrease was the positive effect of our focus on the core widmer brothers brands including our rotator ipas and seasonals  and our high end offerings  which is fueling broader consumer awareness of the overall widmer brothers brand 
the decrease in the widmer brothers brand shipments in compared to was primarily due to the continuing pressure on our hefeweizen beer in the very competitive wheat beer category in the craft segment 
partially offsetting this decrease was the success of our focus on the core and high end widmer brothers brands 
kona continues to be one of the fastest growing brands in the craft category  as seen in the increase in shipments in compared to and compared to we believe this sales growth is due to the always aloha message and quality of the beer resonating with consumers 
the increase in our kona brand shipments in compared to was also due to the success of our kona variety packs and the increased velocity of our kona flagship  longboard lager  in existing markets 
during the third quarter of  we launched our big wave golden ale  previously available only in hawaii  on the mainland 
we continue to successfully introduce our kona beers to new markets  which has been contributing to the brand s shipment growth 
the introduction of our kona beer in cans in march also contributed to the increase 
the increase in our redhook brand shipments in compared to and in compared to were the result of our investments in new packaging  brand introductions and marketing initiatives 
these investments have resulted in the unique redhook brand position  which we believe is resonating with consumers 

table of contents the following table sets forth a comparison of our shipments by package  excluding private label shipments produced under our contract brewing arrangements in barrels year ended december  shipments of total shipments of total shipments of total draft bottle total the shift in package mix from draft to bottle in both compared to and in compared to was primarily the result of the increase in volumes on our kona bottle beer and lower volumes on our hefeweizen draft beer 
there is also increased general competition across the industry for on premise draft sales as the large  multi national brewers enter the craft beer segment 
cost of sales cost of sales includes purchased raw materials  direct labor  overhead and shipping costs 
information regarding cost of sales was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar change change beer related pubs total year ended december  dollar change change beer related pubs total the increase in beer related cost of sales in compared to was due to the increase in shipments discussed above  as well as the mix shift from draft to bottle as the per barrel equivalent cost of bottle is more than draft 
in addition  increased distribution costs  including offsite storage and fuel  increased labor  and higher grain prices  contributed to the increase 
the decrease in beer related cost of sales in compared to was primarily due to the elimination of costs associated with our kona operations prior to the kbc merger  including elimination of all alternating proprietorship related costs  and improved performance and quality trends in this was partially offset by the increase in shipments discussed above  including the mix shift from draft to bottle  as well as increased shipping costs due to fuel surcharges 
the increase in pubs cost of sales in compared to was primarily due to the increase in guest counts noted above  as well as increased labor  food and beverage costs in certain markets 
the increase in pubs cost of sales in compared to was primarily associated with the acquired kona pub operations 
these operations had a positive impact on our gross profit as discussed below 

table of contents gross profit information regarding gross profit was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar change change beer related pubs total year ended december  dollar change change beer related pubs total gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin rate  was as follows year ended december  beer related pubs total the increase in gross profit in compared to was due to increases in shipment volumes discussed above  partially offset by declines in overall gross margin rates 
the decline in the beer related gross margin rate was primarily due to the higher brewery variable costs on a per barrel basis 
the decline was partially offset by better fixed cost coverage  a shift in mix to our higher end beers and the  recorded in sales under the terms of the termination agreement with fsb with no associated costs 
the increase in pubs gross profit in compared to was primarily due to increases in guest counts and pricing  partially offset by increases in labor  food and beverage costs  which contributed to the lower gross margin rate 
the increases in gross profit in compared to were primarily due to the improvements in gross margin rate and the increases in sales discussed above  which included the reduction in a b fees 
the improvements in gross margin rate were primarily due to an improved cost structure related to our kona operations following the kbc merger  which included elimination of the alternating proprietorship revenue and cost of sales  improved brewery performance and quality trends  increased capacity utilization and a shift in mix to our higher end beer products 
these improvements were partially offset by the mix shift from draft to bottle sales as the barrel equivalent of bottle gross profit is lower than draft  as well as an increased cost of shipping as a result of fuel surcharges 
total approximate capacity utilization is calculated by dividing total shipments by the approximate working capacity and was as follows year ended december  capacity utilization during the second quarter of  we added additional fermentation vessels to our breweries  which increased the combined capacity of our production breweries from approximately  barrels per year to approximately  barrels per year as of december  our contract brewing agreement with fsb  which was entered into during the first quarter of  contributed to the improvement in capacity utilization in compared to 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include compensation and related expenses for our sales and marketing activities  management  legal and other professional and administrative support functions 
information regarding sg a was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar change change as a of net sales year ended december  dollar change change as a of net sales the increase in sg a in compared to was primarily due to increases in labor costs as we expand our national footprint into new geographies and increased costs associated with the launch of our omission and big wave brands 
our investments in sales and marketing are consistent with our strategic focus on firmly establishing our brands national footprint and competitively addressing the varied needs of craft beer consumers 
these increases were partially offset by lower packaging design and development costs 
the increase in sg a and sg a as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing costs  principally comprised of labor costs related to our national sales organization  packaging design and development  promotions and sponsorship activity  point of sale and related trade merchandise  and brand platform enhancements 
administrative costs associated with the operations acquired with the kbc merger in october also contributed to the increase 
income from equity method investments income from equity method investments included our share of fsb s net income through the date of sale in may and our share of kona s net income through the date of the kbc merger in october since completion of the kbc merger  kona s operating results have been included in our consolidated operating results 
income from equity method investments was as follows in thousands year ended december  fsb kona total gain on sale of fsb our pre tax gain on the sale of fsb in totaled million  which resulted from proceeds of million less the investment in fsb of million 

table of contents interest expense information regarding interest expense was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  dollar change change interest expense interest expense year ended december  average debt outstanding average interest rate the decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to lower average outstanding borrowings and lower average interest rates 
the average interest rates shown in the above table represent cash interest  exclusive of our interest rate swap 
the decreases in average outstanding borrowings were primarily the result of using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of fsb in may to repay the million outstanding on our line of credit and million outstanding related to capital leases 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to was due to the expiration of a non qualifying interest rate swap in the fourth quarter of and lower average outstanding borrowings 
the increase in the average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was due to the reduction in the outstanding balance on lower interest rate debt during  partially offset by modifications we negotiated with our primary lender in the latter part of as a result of our improved financial condition 
the decrease in average outstanding borrowings was primarily the result of using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of fsb to repay the million outstanding on our line of credit 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rates reflect the impact of non deductible expenses  primarily meals and entertainment  and state and local taxes and tax credits 
the rate in reflects the impact of increasing the tax rate applied against the net deferred tax liability due to the state of california changing income apportionment rules to a single sales factor methodology effective january  this one time adjustment resulted in a percentage point increase to our effective income tax rate  or  of our income tax provision 
the rate in also reflects non deductible merger related expenses and a  reduction to our valuation allowance during the second quarter of we made this reduction  eliminating the valuation allowance  due to the cumulative earnings generated and other evidence available to us regarding the potential of fully utilizing our outstanding net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources we have required capital primarily for the construction and development of our production breweries  to support our expansion and growth plans and to fund our working capital needs 
historically  we have financed our capital requirements through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings and the sale of common and preferred stock 
we anticipate meeting our obligations for the twelve months beginning january  primarily from cash flows generated from operations 
in addition  we may borrow under our line of credit facility as the need arises 
capital resources available to us at december  included million of cash and million available under our line of credit facility 
we had million of cash and million of working capital at december  our debt as a percentage of total capitalization total debt and common shareholders equity was at december  
table of contents a summary of our cash flow information was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by used in investing activities cash flows used in financing activities increase in cash cash provided by operating activities of million in resulted from our net income of million  net non cash expense of million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities as discussed in more detail below 
accounts receivable  net  decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in our receivable from a b  which totaled million at december  historically  we have not had collection problems related to our accounts receivable 
inventories increased million to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily to support an increase in shipment volume 
accounts payable increased million to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to increased inventory purchases to support our increased level of sales  partially offset by a  decrease in the portion of our payable to a b that is included in accounts payable  which totaled million at december  as of december   we had state net operating loss carryforwards nols available to offset payment of future income taxes of  tax effected  and we had no federal nols remaining 
we also had  in federal alternative minimum tax amt credit carry forwards and federal insurance contributions act fica credit carryforwards of  tax effected 
we anticipate that we will utilize the remaining state nols and federal credit carry forwards in the near future and  accordingly  once utilized  we will be required to satisfy all of our income tax obligations with cash 
capital expenditures of million in were primarily for capacity  efficiency and cooperage purposes 
for  we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million to million primarily for capacity and efficiency improvements  quality initiatives and restaurant and retail 
we have a loan agreement as amended  the loan agreement with bofa  which is presently comprised of a million revolving line of credit line of credit  including provisions for cash borrowings and up to million notional amount of letters of credit  and a million term loan term loan 
we may draw upon the line of credit for working capital and general corporate purposes

see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for additional information 
inflation we believe that the impact of inflation was minimal on our business in  and critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are based upon the selection and application of significant accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
our estimates are based upon historical experience  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at various points in time 
actual results may differ  potentially significantly  from these estimates 
goodwill goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
all goodwill has been allocated to our beer related reporting unit based on the relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased and existing operations 
reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in note segment results and concentrations in part ii  item of this form k 
we perform an annual impairment assessment as of december of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value 
for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
qualitative factors considered in this assessment include  but are not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for our products and services  regulatory and political developments  and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance 
we are not required to perform a qualitative assessment for our annual impairment test and may instead bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the two step goodwill impairment test 

table of contents for reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value  we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test  which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the second step includes determining the implied fair value of goodwill  which is then compared with the carrying amount to determine if an impairment loss is recorded 
we use a combination of valuation methods  market capitalization and income approach  to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the significant estimates and assumptions used by management in assessing the recoverability of goodwill are estimated future cash flows  present value discount rate  estimated growth of the overall craft beer segment  and other factors 
if our estimated future cash flows were to significantly decline  an impairment charge could result 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgment 
indefinite lived intangible assets we review indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily comprised of our trademarks  domain name and recipes  for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for indefinite lived intangible assets that we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  no further testing is required 
for those for which we do not conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than the carrying value  we test the asset for recoverability 
recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if it is determined that an individual asset is impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
we are not required to perform a qualitative assessment for our annual impairment test and may instead bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test 
the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangibles are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by various factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines 
long lived asset impairment we evaluate potential impairment of our long lived assets  including our distributor agreements  non compete agreements and other intangible assets  when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such long lived assets may be impaired 
in such cases  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future undiscounted cash flows and by preparing other quantitative and qualitative analyses 
upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss during the current period 
we did not identify indicators of impairment during  or 
table of contents refundable deposits on kegs we distribute our draft beer in kegs that are owned by us  as well as in kegs that have been leased from third parties 
kegs that are owned by us are reflected as a component of property  equipment and leasehold improvements in our consolidated balance sheets at cost and are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the keg 
when draft beer is shipped to the wholesaler  regardless of whether the keg is owned or leased  we collect a refundable deposit  reflected as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
upon return of the keg to us  the deposit is refunded to the wholesaler 
when a wholesaler cannot account for some of our kegs for which it is responsible  it pays us a fixed fee and forfeits its deposit for each keg determined to be lost 
we have experienced some loss of kegs and anticipate that some loss will occur in future periods due to the significant volume of kegs handled by each wholesaler and retailer  the similarities between kegs owned by most brewers  and the relatively low deposit collected on each keg when compared with the market value of the keg 
we believe that this is an industry wide issue and our loss experience is typical of the industry 
in order to estimate forfeited deposits attributable to lost kegs  we periodically use internal records  a b records  other third party records  and historical information to estimate the physical count of kegs held by wholesalers and a b 
these estimates affect the amount recorded as brewery equipment and refundable deposits as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
the actual liability for refundable deposits could differ from estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales  net of excise taxes  discounts and certain fees we must pay in connection with sales to a member of the a b wholesale distributor network  when the products are delivered to the member 
a member of the a b wholesale distributor network may be a branch of a b or an independent wholesale distributor 
we recognize revenue on contract brewing sales when the product is shipped to our contract brewing customer 
we recognize revenue on retail sales at the time of sale and we recognize revenue from events at the time of the event 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and net operating loss carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we will record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
if we are unable to generate adequate taxable income in future periods or our assessment that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets will be realized is otherwise not accurate  we may incur charges in future periods to record a valuation allowance on our gross deferred tax assets 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have assessed our vulnerability to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with financial instruments included in cash and long term debt 
to mitigate this risk  we entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement  which expires july   to hedge the variability of interest payments associated with our variable rate borrowings 
through this swap agreement  we pay interest at a fixed rate of and receive interest at a floating rate of the one month libor  which was at december  since the interest rate swap hedges the variability of interest payments on variable rate debt with similar terms  it qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
this interest rate swap reduces our overall interest rate risk 
we did not have any unhedged variable rate debt outstanding at december  due to the nature of our highly liquid cash  an increase or decrease in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our cash or the related interest income
