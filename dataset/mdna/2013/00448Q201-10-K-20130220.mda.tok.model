item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that was established to discover  develop and commercialize innovative treatments for infectious diseases 
within the anti infective market  we are currently concentrating on the development of antivirals for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c viral infection  or hcv 
we are currently focusing our efforts on developing the following three clinical stage drug candidates which we intend to study in combination with each other and or potentially in combination with compounds owned by others  each combination being investigated for the treatment of hcv sovaprevir  a ns protease inhibitor being investigated for the treatment of hcv  currently in phase ii clinical development  ach  a nsa inhibitor being investigated for the treatment of hcv  currently in phase ii clinical development  ach  a ns protease inhibitor being investigated for the treatment of hcv  which recently completed phase i clinical development 
in addition  we have established a pipeline of certain antibacterial product candidates for which we are currently seeking appropriate collaborative partners  but to which we are not devoting significant resources at this time 
these product candidates include ach for the treatment of dermatologic and ophthalmic infections  and ach for the treatment of serious resistant bacterial infections  including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus 
we have also developed and out licensed certain development and commercialization rights to elvucitabine  for the treatment of both hepatitis b  or hbv  and human immunodeficiency virus  or hiv 
we have devoted and are continuing to devote substantially all of our efforts toward product research and development 
we have incurred losses of million from inception through december  and had an accumulated deficit of million at december   which includes preferred stock dividends recognized until our initial public offering in our net losses were million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from the sale of equity securities  including our initial public offering in october  private placements of our common stock in august and august and registered offerings of our common stock in january  june and august in august  we issued  shares of our common stock in a registered direct offering with funds managed by qvt financial lp 
we received net proceeds of million 
in june  we issued  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering  including the underwriters exercise of an over allotment option 
we received net proceeds of million 
in august  we issued  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in a private placement to institutional and other accredited investors 
we received net proceeds of million 
in january  we issued  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering 
in february  we issued an additional  shares of common stock in connection with the underwriters exercise of an over allotment option 
we received net proceeds of million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years as we seek to continue clinical testing of sovaprevir  ach and ach  and identify and progress additional drug candidates 

table of contents we will need substantial additional financing to obtain regulatory approvals  fund operating losses  and  if deemed appropriate  establish manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us  if at all 
in addition to the risks associated with early stage companies  there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete our research and development  obtain adequate patent protection for our technology  obtain necessary government regulatory approval for drug candidates we develop  find and maintain appropriate collaboration partners or that any approved drug candidates will be commercially viable 
in addition  we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our drug candidates 
financial operations overview revenue to date  we have not generated revenue from the sale of any drugs 
the majority of our revenue recognized to date has been derived from our former collaboration with gilead to develop compounds for use in treating hcv 
during the years ended december    and we recognized million   and  respectively  under this collaboration agreement 
upon initiating the collaboration with gilead in  we received a payment of million  which included an equity investment by gilead determined to be worth approximately million 
the remaining million  as well as a million milestone achieved during the period prior to proof of concept  was accounted for under the proportionate performance model 
revenue under the proportionate performance model was recognized as effort under the collaboration was incurred 
payments made by us to gilead in connection with this collaboration were recognized as a reduction of revenue 
in february  our collaboration with gilead was terminated 
we retain the right to develop ach  a compound discovered and developed under the collaboration  although we do not have current plans to do so 
we did not recognize any revenue related to the amortization of deferred revenue during the years ended december  and  as we were unable to accurately estimate our total performance obligations under the gilead collaboration 
effective with the february termination of the collaboration  we recognized the remaining million of deferred revenue 
in october  we entered into a license and development agreement with ora  inc ora for the worldwide development and commercialization of ach delivered topically or locally 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue upon the initiation of the ora agreement related to the one time nonrefundable license fee and an additional  upon the sublicensing by ora of ach to taejoon pharmaceutical co  ltd in december we have also recognized revenue under a small business innovation research  or sbir  grant by the national institutes of health  or nih  for the further study of a back up series of compounds related to ach for the treatment of tuberculosis infection 
during the year ended december   we recognized revenue of  under this grant 
additionally  we recognized revenue related to the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program  or qtdp 
the qtdp program was created by the united states congress as part of the patient protection and affordable care act and provided for reimbursement of certain costs paid or incurred during and directly related to the conduct of a qualifying therapeutic discovery project  as defined 
the department of health and human services designated such projects based on the potential for them to result in new therapies to treat areas of unmet medical need  the potential to create and sustain jobs in the us and to advance us competitiveness 
during the year ended december   we recognized revenue of million related to this program 

table of contents research and development our research and development expenses reflect costs incurred for our proprietary research and development projects which consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our research and development personnel  costs of services by clinical research organizations  other outsourced research  materials used during research and development activities  facility related costs such as rent and utilities associated with our laboratory and clinical development space and operating supplies 
all costs associated with internal research and development  and research and development services for which we have externally contracted  are expensed as incurred 
the costs of obtaining patents for our candidates are expensed as incurred as indirect costs 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows for the years ended december  in thousands direct external costs sovaprevir and related compounds ach and related compounds ach and related compounds ach and related compounds other direct internal personnel costs sub total direct costs indirect costs and overhead connecticut research and development tax credit total research and development we are currently conducting phase ii clinical trials of sovaprevir  phase ii clinical trials of ach  and phase i clinical trials of ach the state of connecticut provides companies with the opportunity to exchange certain research and development credit carryforwards for cash in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of the research and development credit 
the program provides for such exchange of the research and development credits at a rate of of the annual research and development credit  as defined 
this benefit is recorded as a reduction of research and development expenditures 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our drug candidates 
we are also unable to predict when  if ever  material net cash inflows will commence from any of our compounds 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the potential benefits of our drug candidates over other therapies  our ability to market  commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our drug candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future  results of future clinical trials that we may conduct  results of clinical trials conducted by our competitors  
table of contents the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the expense and timing of regulatory approvals  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate 
for example  if the fda or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required to complete clinical development of a drug candidate  or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
we expect expenses associated with the completion of these programs to be substantial and to increase over time 
we do not believe  however  that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program specific expenses through commercialization 
there exist numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our drug candidates  including future trial design and various regulatory requirements  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development 
additionally  future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will evolve and therefore impact our clinical development programs and plans over time 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for management and administrative personnel  professional fees for legal  accounting and other services  travel costs and facility related costs such as rent  utilities and other general office expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management makes estimates and exercises judgment in revenue recognition  research and development costs  stock based compensation and accrued expenses 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  revenue recognition 
revenue generating research and development collaborations are often multiple element arrangements  providing for a license as well as research and development services 
in order to account for these arrangements  we must identify the deliverable included within the arrangement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of 
table of contents accounting based on if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the collaborator 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
when we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue related to upfront license payments will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportionate performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
under the proportionate performance method  periodic revenue related to up front license payments is recognized as the percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
actual effort is generally determined based upon actual direct labor hours or ftes incurred and include research and development activities performed by internal scientists 
total expected effort is generally based upon the total projected direct labor hours 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete the related performance obligations 
in the event that a change in estimate occurs  the change will be accounted for using the cumulative catch up method which provides for an adjustment to revenue in the current period 
estimates of our level of effort may change in the future  resulting in a material change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods  including negative revenue in some periods 
generally under collaboration arrangements  payments received during the period of performance may include up front payments  time or performance based milestones and reimbursement of internal and external costs 
the proportion of actual performance to total expected performance is applied to these payments in determining periodic revenue  but will be limited by the aggregate cash received or receivable to date 
substantive milestone payments are recognized upon achievement of the milestone 
determining whether a milestone is substantive requires judgment that should be made at the inception of the arrangement 
to meet the definition of a substantive milestone  the consideration earned by achieving the milestone would have to be commensurate with either the level of effort required to achieve the milestone or the enhancement in the value of the item delivered  would have to relate solely to past performance  and should be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
no bifurcation of an individual milestone is allowed and there can be more than one milestone in an arrangement 
stock based compensation employee stock based awards we apply asc  stock compensation  which requires measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases under our espp plan  based on estimated fair values 
we primarily grant qualified stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant 
to the extent that the amount of the aggregate fair market value of qualified stock options that become exercisable for an individual exceeds  during any tax year  those stock options are treated as non qualified stock options 
under the fair value recognition provisions  stock based compensation cost is based on the value of the portion of stock based awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of assumptions which determine the fair value of the stock based awards 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
we utilize the simplified method in developing an estimate of the expected term of plain vanilla share options 
this method is considered appropriate given our limited exercise history 
further  we do not believe the 
table of contents exercise patterns associated with these option grants are predictive of future exercise patterns 
additionally  we calculate volatility based on actual volatility from the end of our initial public offering lock up period to the end of the reporting period 
for periods before we had sufficient actual volatility data  we used a weighted average rate of historical and peer group volatility 
we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the grant date and recognize compensation costs for only those awards that are expected to vest 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  or if we experience significant fluctuations in our stock price  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation 
there is risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may differ from the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
some of our service providers require upfront or milestone payments 
if our estimate of services performed is less than the upfront or milestone payments  the difference is accounted for as a prepaid expense 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with us gaap 
income taxes we use an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax basis assets and liabilities and are measured by applying enacted rates and laws to taxable years in which differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
further  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the rate changes 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we apply the provisions of asc  income taxes  which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not file a return in a particular jurisdiction 
our financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of such positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 

table of contents we do not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of december  we review all tax positions to ensure the tax treatment selected is sustainable based on its technical merits and that the position would be sustained if challenged 
results of operations results of operations may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development projects  technological advances and determinations as to the commercial potential of proposed products  the timing of payments received under existing or future strategic alliances  joint ventures or financings  if any

during the year ended december   we also recognized  of revenue related to the upfront license payment received upon initiation of the ora agreement and  upon the subsequent sublicensing of ach entered into by ora with taejoon pharmaceuticals 
during the year ended december   in addition to revenue under our gilead collaboration  we recognized revenue under a sbir grant and the qtdp program 
comparison of the years ended december  and the increase in collaboration revenue in is primarily related to the recognition of million of deferred revenue related to our former collaboration with gilead which was terminated in february comparison of the years ended december  and the increase in collaboration revenue in was due to increased intellectual property costs related to our nsa antagonist 
these costs were incurred by us and were shared with gilead

table of contents we expect to incur continuing and increasing losses from operations for at least the next several years as we seek to continue clinical testing of sovaprevir  ach and ach  and identify and progress additional drug candidates 
we do not expect our existing capital resources to be sufficient to fund the completion of the development of any of our drug candidates 
as a result  we will need to raise additional funds prior to  among other things  being able to market any drug candidates  to obtain regulatory approvals  fund operating losses  and  if deemed appropriate  establish manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities 
we will seek to raise such additional financing through i public or private equity or debt financings  ii collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or iii other sources of financing 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least december  however  our funding resources and requirements may change and will depend upon numerous factors  including but not limited to the costs involved in the clinical development  manufacturing and formulation of sovaprevir  ach and ach  the scope of and costs associated with entering cooperative study arrangements  or csas  if any  for the collaborative development of our drug candidates with other s drug candidates in combination  the costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  the scope  prioritization and number of programs we pursue  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing and defending patent and other intellectual property claims  our ability to raise incremental debt or equity capital  including any changes in the credit or equity markets that may impact our ability to obtain capital in the future  our acquisition and development of new technologies and drug candidates  and competing technological and market developments currently unknown to us 
we intend to augment our cash balance through financing transactions  including the issuance of debt or equity securities  and or further corporate alliances 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate levels of additional funding or favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we will be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate research and development programs  obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others on terms unfavorable to us or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently  and or pursue merger or acquisition strategies 
any future equity funding may dilute the ownership of our equity investors 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table sets forth a summary of our commitments as of december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands debt  including interest operating lease obligations clinical research obligations research obligations and licenses other professional obligations other license and research development agreements total other professional obligations consist mainly of general and administrative consulting obligations 
other license and research development agreements consists of potential payments due to yale university and emory university upon the achievement of specified development milestones for elvucitabine 
we are also required to pay yale university and emory university royalties on net sales of elvucitabine and a specified share of sublicensing fees that we receive under any sublicenses that we grant 
the timing and achievement of such milestones is uncertain and may differ from current assumptions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  recently issued accounting standards we review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact  if any  that the adoption of each such standard will have 
as of the filing of this report  there were no new accounting standards issued that we expect to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we regularly review our investments and monitor the financial markets 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  government sponsored bond obligations and government backed corporate debt securities  with the effective duration of the portfolio less than twelve months and no security with an effective duration in excess of twenty four months  which we believe are subject to limited credit risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk or changes in credit ratings arising from our investments 
capital market risk 
we currently have no product revenues and depend on funds raised through other sources 
one source of funding is through future debt or equity offerings 
our ability to raise funds in this manner depends upon capital market forces affecting our stock price
