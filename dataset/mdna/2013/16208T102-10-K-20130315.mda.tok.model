financial condition and operating performance metrics we measure financial condition and hotel operating performance by evaluating financial and operating metrics such as revenue per available room revpar  average daily rate adr  occupancy percentage  funds from operations ffo  adjusted ffo  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and adjusted ebitda 
we evaluate the hotels in our portfolio and potential acquisitions using these metrics to determine each hotel s contribution towards providing income to our shareholders through increases in distributable cash flow and increasing long term total returns through appreciation in the value of our common shares 
revpar  adr and occupancy are hotel industry measures commonly used to evaluate operating performance 
revpar  which is calculated as total room revenue divided by total number of available rooms  is an important metric for monitoring hotel operating performance 
non gaap financial measures below provides a detailed discussion of our use of ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation of ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income or loss  measurements recognized by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
results of operations industry outlook we believe that the hotel industry s performance is correlated to the performance of the economy overall  and with key economic indicators such as gdp growth  employment trends and corporate profits 
we expect a continuing improvement in the performance of the hotel industry 
as reported by smith travel research  monthly industry revpar has been higher year over year since march as reported by smith travel 
table of contents research  industry revpar was up in  in and in industry analysts such as smith travel research and pkf hospitality are projecting industry revpar to grow in based on sustained economic growth  lack of new supply and increased business travel spending

we are currently projecting revpar at our hotels to grow in with adr comprising most of our revpar growth 
industry analysts and other public lodging companies have begun to refine their revpar projections for most expect revpar to continue to grow in  albeit at levels less than what the industry experienced in and comparison year ended december  to the year ended december  results of operations for the years ended december  and include the operating activities of the hotels owned at december   which includes the portland hotel acquired on december  and the five hotels acquired in the third quarter of the sisters  compared to the results of operations for the hotels that we owned for all or part of the year ended december  as reported by smith travel research  industry revpar for the years ended december  and was up and up  respectively 
revpar at our hotels was up and in and  respectively  which includes periods prior to our ownership 
approximately one half of our revpar growth in was attributable to occupancy growth as some of our hotels are operating at high occupancy levels  their future revpar growth generally will be dependent on rate growth 
our revpar growth in was less than the industry due to significant renovations in revenue total revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to total revenue of million for the year ended december  since all of our hotels are premium branded upscale extended stay hotels and select service  room revenue is the primary revenue source as these hotels do not have significant food and beverage revenue or large group conference facilities 
room revenue was and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increased revenue is primarily due to million of revenue from the sisters for january to june since we did not own those hotels until july the remainder is due to increased revpar at the other comparable hotels 
since room revenue is the primary component of total revenue  our revenue results are dependent on maintaining and improving occupancy  adr and revpar at our hotels

hotel property acquisition costs hotel property acquisition costs increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the expenses relate to the acquisition of hotels formerly owned by innkeepers described in note  acquisition of hotel properties  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the expenses represent costs associated with the purchase of the hotels owned at december  these acquisition related costs are expensed when incurred in accordance with gaap 
interest and other income interest income on cash and cash equivalents decreased thousand from thousand for the year ended december  to thousand for the year ended december  this decrease was due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the company had not fully invested the cash from its ipo in the period and the excess cash was held in an interest bearing account 
interest expense interest expense increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to the following assumption of million of loans on the five hotels acquired in july bearing interest at a rate of approximately  increase in weighted average borrowings on our credit facility of million from million in to million in  and debt issued in august on our new rochelle hotel of million at a rate of 
the interest rate on the senior secured revolving credit facility was in and increased to november  non gaap financial measures we consider the following non gaap financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda  and adjusted ebitda 
these non gaap financial measures could be considered along with  but not as alternatives to  net income or loss as a measure of our operating performance prescribed by gaap 

table of contents ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not represent cash generated from operating activities under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss  cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of our liquidity  nor are ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda or adjusted ebitda indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
these measurements do not reflect cash expenditures for long term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred 
ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures  property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties 
we calculate ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which defines ffo as net income or loss calculated in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  impairment write downs  items classified by gaap as extraordinary  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  plus depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures following the same approach 
we believe that the presentation of ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it measures our performance without regard to specified non cash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization  gain or loss on sale of real estate assets and certain other items that we believe are not indicative of the performance of our underlying hotel properties 
we believe that these items are more representative of our asset base and our acquisition and disposition activities than our ongoing operations  and that by excluding the effects of the items  ffo is useful to investors in comparing our operating performance between periods and between reits that report ffo using the nareit definition 
we further adjust ffo for certain additional items that are not in nareit s definition of ffo  including hotel property acquisition costs and other charges  including similar items within the unconsolidated real estate entities 
other charges include costs related to hurricane sandy  severance costs for a former executive officer  and other costs we believe do not represent recurring operations 
we believe that adjusted ffo provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between reits that make similar adjustments to ffo 
the following is a reconciliation of net loss to ffo and adjusted ffo for the years ended december   and in thousands  except share data for the years ended december  funds from operations ffo net loss gain on the sale of assets within the unconsolidated real estate entity depreciation adjustments for unconsolidated real estate entity items ffo hotel property acquisition costs and other charges other charges included in general and administrative expenses adjustments for unconsolidated real estate entity items adjusted ffo weighted average number of common shares basic diluted 
table of contents we calculate ebitda for purposes of the credit facility debt covenants as net income or loss excluding interest expense  provision for income taxes  including income taxes applicable to sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  and unconsolidated real estate entity items including interest  depreciation and amortization excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate 
we believe ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors compare our operating performance between periods and between reits by removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
in addition  we use ebitda as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions 
we further adjust ebitda for certain additional items  including hotel property acquisition costs and other charges  including similar items within the unconsolidated real estate entity 
other charges include costs related to hurricane sandy  severance costs related to the departure of one of our executive officers in and other costs we believe do not represent recurring operations and amortization of non cash share based compensation which we believe are not indicative of the performance of our underlying hotel properties entities 
we believe that adjusted ebitda provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between reits that report similar measures the following is reconciliation of net income loss to ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the years ended december   and in thousands for the years ended december  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda net loss interest expense income tax expense gain on the sale of assets within the unconsolidated real estate entity depreciation and amortization adjustments for unconsolidated real estate entity items ebitda hotel property acquisition costs and other charges adjustments for unconsolidated real estate entity items other charges included in general and administrative expenses share based compensation adjusted ebitda although we present ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda because we believe they are useful to investors in comparing our operating performance between periods and between reits that report similar measures  these measures have limitations as analytical tools 
some of these limitations are ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect funds available to make cash distributions  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  
table of contents although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may need to be replaced in the future  and ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  non cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long term incentive compensation package  although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period using adjusted ebitda  adjusted ffo and adjusted ebitda do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges including acquisition transaction costs that result from matters we consider not to be indicative of the underlying performance of our hotel properties  and other companies in our industry may calculate ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 
in addition  ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss  cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of our liquidity 
because of these limitations  ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda only supplementally 
our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere are prepared in accordance with gaap 
sources and uses of cash our principal sources of cash include net cash from operations and proceeds from debt and equity issuances 
our principal uses of cash include acquisitions  capital expenditures  operating expenses  corporate expenditures  interest expenses and debt repayments and distributions to equity holders

in addition  changes in operating assets and liabilities due to the timing of cash receipts  payments for real estate taxes  payments of corporate compensation and payments from our hotels resulted in net cash outflow of million 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million 
we spent million on improvements at our hotels and acquired the portland hotel for million 
these outflows were partially offset by distributions from unconsolidated real estate entities of million consisting of million of net proceeds from mortgage financing  million attributable to cash generated from the operations of the jv and million for the sale of assets and reimbursements from required escrows of million 
future distributions from unconsolidated real estate entities are contingent upon projected hotel operations and the potential sale of assets

in addition  changes in operating assets and liabilities due to the timing of cash receipts and payments from our hotels resulted in net cash inflow of million 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million  which represents the acquisition price for thirteen hotels of million as well as additional capital improvements to those hotels of million and million of funds placed into escrows for lender and manager required escrows

we have paid regular quarterly dividends and distributions on common shares and ltip units since the third quarter of dividends and distributions for each of the quarters of and the first quarter of were per common share and ltip unit 
dividends and distributions for the second  third and fourth quarters of increased to per common share and ltip unit 
on january   we paid an aggregate of million in fourth quarter dividends on our common shares and distributions on our ltip units 
liquidity and capital resources we intend to maintain our leverage over the long term at a ratio of net debt to investment in hotels at cost defined as our initial acquisition price plus the gross amount of any subsequent capital investment and excluding any impairment charges to less than percent measured at the time we incur debt  and a subsequent decrease in hotel property values will not necessarily cause us to repay debt to comply with this limitation 
however  our board of trustees believes that temporarily increasing our leverage limit at this stage of the lodging recovery cycle is appropriate 
we will continue to pay down borrowings on our secured revolving credit facility with excess cash flow until we find other uses of cash such as investments in our existing hotels  hotel acquisitions or further joint venture investments 
at december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  in borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
at december   there were ten properties in the borrowing base under the credit agreement and the maximum borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was approximately million 
we also had mortgage debt on individual hotels aggregating million and million at december  and december   respectively 
on february   we borrowed an additional million under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
the funds were used for the acquisition of the courtyard by marriott houston medical center on february  we amended our senior secured revolving credit facility in may the amendment provides for an increase in the allowable consolidated leverage ratio to percent through  reducing to percent in 
table of contents and a decrease in the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio from x to x through march  increasing to x through december and x in subject to certain conditions  the credit facility has an accordion feature that provides the company with the ability to increase the facility to million 
we further amended the credit facility in november costs associated with this amendment were approximately million 
the amendment extends the maturity date to november  and includes an option to extend the maturity date by an additional year 
other key terms amended were as follows original terms amended terms facility amount million million accordion feature additional million additional million libor floor none interest rate applicable margin basis points  based on leverage ratio basis points  based on leverage ratio unused fee basis points basis points if less than unused  basis points if more than unused minimum fixed charge coverage ratio x x the credit facility contains representations  warranties  covenants  terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum net worth financial covenants  limitations on i liens  ii incurrence of debt  iii investments  iv distributions  and v mergers and asset dispositions  covenants to preserve corporate existence and comply with laws  covenants on the use of proceeds of the credit facility and default provisions  including defaults for non payment  breach of representations and warranties  insolvency  non performance of covenants  cross defaults and guarantor defaults 
the five mortgage loans we assumed in connection with the acquisition of the sisters  as well as the loan secured by the new rochelle residence inn  do not contain any financial covenants 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants at december  we expect to meet all financial covenants in based upon our current projections 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  short term borrowings under our credit facility 
we believe that our net cash provided by operations will be adequate to fund operating obligations  pay interest on any borrowings and fund dividends in accordance with the requirements for qualification as a reit under the code 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as hotel property acquisitions and debt maturities or repayments through additional long term secured and unsecured borrowings  the issuance of additional equity or debt securities or the possible sale of existing assets 
during january  we issued  common shares  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds of this offering were used to repay debt borrowed under our senior secured credit facility  including debt incurred to acquire the portland hotel 
we intend to continue to invest in hotel properties only as suitable opportunities arise 
we intend to finance our future investments with the net proceeds from additional issuances of common and preferred shares  issuances of units of limited partnership interest in our operating partnership or other securities or borrowings 
the success of our acquisition strategy depends  in part  on our ability to access additional capital through issuances of equity securities and borrowings 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to make investments in properties that meet our investment criteria 
additionally  we may choose to dispose of certain hotels that do not meet our long term investment objectives as a means to provide liquidity 
capital expenditures we intend to maintain each hotel property in good repair and condition and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations and in accordance with the franchisor s standards and any agreed upon requirements in our management and loan agreements 
after we acquire a hotel property  we may be required to complete a property 
table of contents improvement plan pip in order to be granted a new franchise license for that particular hotel property 
pips are intended to bring the hotel property up to the franchisor s standards 
certain of our loans require that we escrow for property improvement purposes  at the hotels collateralizing these loans  amounts up to of gross revenue from such hotels 
we intend to spend amounts necessary to comply with any reasonable loan or franchisor requirements and otherwise to the extent that such expenditures are in the best interest of the hotel 
to the extent that we spend more on capital expenditures than is available from our operations  we intend to fund those capital expenditures with available cash and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
for the years ended december  and  we invested approximately million and million  respectively  on capital investments in our hotels 
we expect to invest an additional million on capital improvements in on our existing hotels and approximately million on the conversion of our washington  dc hotel to a residence inn by marriott 
related party transactions we have entered into transactions and arrangements with related parties that could result in potential conflicts of interest 
see risk factors and note  related party transactions  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands

payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years corporate office lease revolving credit facility  including interest ground leases property loans  including interest does not reflect additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility after december  and interest payments are based on the interest rate in effect as of december  see note  debt to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our property loans 
on december   we entered into a contract to purchase the courtyard by marriott houston medical center located in houston  texas for a total purchase price of approximately million  which is excluded from the table above 
the hotel was acquired on february  inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 

table of contents critical accounting policies we consider the following policies critical because they require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain  involve various assumptions and require management judgment 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
investment in hotel properties we allocate the purchase prices of hotel properties acquired based on the fair value of the acquired real estate  furniture  fixtures and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities 
in making estimates of fair value for purposes of allocating the purchase price  we utilize a number of sources of information that are obtained in connection with the acquisition of a hotel property  including valuations performed by independent third parties and information obtained about each hotel property resulting from pre acquisition due diligence 
hotel property acquisition costs  such as transfer taxes  title insurance  environmental and property condition reviews  and legal and accounting fees  are expensed in the period incurred 
our investment in hotel properties are carried at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  generally years for buildings  years for land improvements  years for building improvements and two to seven years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
renovations and or replacements at the hotel properties that improve or extend the life of the assets are capitalized and depreciated over their useful lives  while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
upon the sale or retirement of property and equipment  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the company s accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
we will periodically review our hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause a review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at the properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where the hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management will perform an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  without interest charges  from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel property exceed its carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount to the related hotel property s estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 
as of december  and  we had no hotels that were impaired 
we will consider a hotel property as held for sale when a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash  no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner and the sale is expected to occur within one year 
if these criteria are met  depreciation and amortization of the hotel property will cease and an impairment loss  if any will be recognized if the fair value of the hotel property  less the costs to sell  is lower than the carrying amount of the hotel property 
we will classify the loss  together with the related operating results  as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets if we no longer have significant continuing involvement 
as of december   we had no hotel properties held for sale 
investment in unconsolidated real estate entities if it is determined that the company do not have a controlling interest in a joint venture  either through its financial interest in a vie or in a voting interest entity  the equity method of accounting is used 
under this method  the investment  originally recorded at cost  is adjusted to recognize the company s share of net earnings or losses of the affiliates as they occur rather than as dividends or other distributions are received  limited to the extent of its investment in  advances to and commitments for the investee 

table of contents investment in unconsolidated real estate entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and the company records its equity in earnings or losses under the hypothetical liquidation of book value hlbv method of accounting due to the structures and the preferences we receive on the distributions from the joint ventures pursuant to the joint venture agreements 
under this method  the company recognizes income and loss in each period based on the change in liquidation proceeds we would receive from a hypothetical liquidation of our investment based on depreciated book value 
therefore  income or loss may be allocated disproportionately as compared to the ownership percentages due to specified preferred return rate thresholds and may be more or less than actual cash distributions received and more or less than what the company may receive in the event of an actual liquidation 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its investment in unconsolidated joint ventures to determine if circumstances indicate impairment to the carrying value of the investment that is other than temporary 
when an impairment indicator is present  the company will estimate the fair value of the investment 
the company s estimate of fair value takes into consideration factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as other factors 
this determination requires significant estimates by management  including the expected cash flows to be generated by the assets owned and operated by the joint venture 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the company s investment in the unconsolidated joint venture 
revenue recognition revenue from hotel operations is recognized when rooms are occupied and when services are provided 
revenue consists of amounts derived from hotel operations  including sales from room  meeting room  gift shop  in room movie and other ancillary amenities 
sales  use  occupancy  and similar taxes are collected and presented on a net basis excluded from revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
share based compensation we measure compensation expense for the restricted share awards and ltip units based upon the fair market value of our common shares at the date of grant 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period and is included in general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
we pay dividends on vested and nonvested restricted shares  except for performance based shares for which dividends on unvested shares are not paid until these shares are vested 
income taxes we elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
in order to qualify as a reit under the code  we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement to distribute at least of our annual reit taxable income to our shareholders which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with gaap 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we currently distribute our taxable income to our shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the irs grants us relief under certain statutory provisions 
such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to shareholders 
however  we believe we have been organized and that we operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a reit 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu created a uniform framework for applying fair value measurement principles for 
table of contents companies around the world and clarified existing guidance in us gaap 
asu is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after december  the company adopted this standard and it did not have any material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic  presentation of comprehensive income 
this update is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in the financial statements by requiring public companies to present comprehensive income either as a single statement detailing the components of net income and total net income  the components of other comprehensive income and total other comprehensive income  and a total for comprehensive income or using a two statement approach including both a statement of income and a statement of comprehensive income 
the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity has been eliminated 
the amendments in this update are effective for public companies for fiscal years  and interim periods beginning after december  currently  the company has no items of other comprehensive income in any periods presented

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we may be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our assumption of long term debt in connection with our acquisitions 
our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we will seek to borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and  in some cases  with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates 
with respect to variable rate financing  we will assess interest rate risk by identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
the company estimates the fair value of its fixed rate debt by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at estimated market rates 
rates take into consideration general market conditions and maturity and fair value of the underlying collateral 
the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
at december   our consolidated debt was comprised of floating and fixed interest rate debt 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt indicates the estimated principal amount of debt having the same debt service requirements that could have been borrowed at the date presented  at then current market interest rates 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands expected maturities thereafter total fair value liabilities floating rate debt average interest rate fixed rate debt average interest rate libor of plus a margin of at december  
table of contents we estimate that a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the variable interest rate would result in additional interest expense of approximately million annually 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our floating rate debt remains at million  the balance as of december
