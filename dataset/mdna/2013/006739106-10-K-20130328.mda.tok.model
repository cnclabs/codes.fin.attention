item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a comprehensive provider of home and community based services  which are primarily social in nature and are provided in the home  focused on the dual eligible population 
our services include personal care and assistance with activities of daily living  and adult day care 
our consumers are individuals with special needs who are at risk of hospitalization or institutionalization  such as the elderly  chronically ill and disabled 
our payor clients include federal  state and local governmental agencies  commercial insurers and private individuals 
we provide home and community based services through over locations across states to over  consumers 
effective march   we sold substantially all of the assets used in our home health business in arkansas  nevada and south carolina  and of the home health business in california and illinois  to the purchasers for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
we retained a ownership interest in the home health business in california and illinois 
the assets sold included home health agencies and two hospice agencies in five states 
through these home health agencies  we previously provided physical  occupational and speech therapy  as well as skilled nursing services  to pediatric  adult infirm and elderly patients 
we are also holding as assets for sale two agencies located in idaho and pennsylvania 
the results of the home health business sold or held for sale are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented herein 
continuing operations include the results of operations previously included in our home community segment and three agencies previously included in our home health segment 
following the sale of the home health business  we manage and internally report our business in one segment 
we believe the sale of the home health business substantially positions us for future growth 
the sale allows us to focus both management and financial resources to address changes in the home and community based services industry and to address the needs of managed care organizations as they become responsible for state sponsored programs 
we have improved our financial performance by lowering our administrative costs and concentrating our efforts on the business that is growing and providing all of our profitability and disposing of the business that was unprofitable 
we have improved our overall financial position by eliminating our debt and adding substantial amounts in cash reserves to our balance sheet 
a summary of our results for and are provided in the table below percent change net service revenues continuing operations net service revenues discontinued operations net income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations   n a net income loss   n a the home and community based services we provide are primarily social in nature and include assistance with bathing  grooming  dressing  personal hygiene and medication reminders  and other activities of daily living 
we provide these services on a long term  continuous basis  with an average duration of approximately months per consumer 
our adult day centers provide a comprehensive program of skilled and support services and designated medical services for adults in a community based group setting 
services provided by our adult 
table of contents day centers include social activities  transportation services to and from the centers  the provision of meals and snacks  personal care and therapeutic activities such as exercise and cognitive interaction 
we utilize a coordinated care model that is designed to enhance consumer outcomes and satisfaction as well as lower the cost of acute care treatment and reduce service duplication 
through our coordinated care model  we utilize our home care aides to observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of early intervention in the disease process  thereby preventing or reducing the cost of medical services by avoiding emergency room visits  and or reducing the need of hospitalization 
these changes in condition are evaluated by appropriately trained managers and referred to appropriate medical personnel including the primary care physicians and managed care plans for treatment and follow up 
we will coordinate the services provided by our team with those of selected health care agencies 
we believe this approach to the provision of care to our consumers and the integration of our services into the broader healthcare industry is particularly attractive to managed care providers and others who are ultimately responsible for the healthcare needs of our consumers and over time will increase our business with them 
our ability to grow our net service revenues is closely correlated with the number of consumers to whom we provide our services 
our continued growth depends on our ability to maintain our existing payor client relationships  establish relationships with new payors  enter into new contracts and increase our referral sources 
our continued growth is also dependent upon the authorization by state agencies of new consumers to receive our services 
we believe there are several market opportunities for growth 
the us population of persons aged and older is growing  and the us census bureau estimates that this population will more than double by additionally  we believe the overwhelming majority of individuals in need of care generally prefer to receive care in their homes or community based settings 
finally  we believe the provision of home and community based services is more cost effective than the provision of similar services in an institutional setting for long term care 
we have historically grown our business primarily through organic growth  complemented with selective acquisitions 
our acquisitions have historically been focused on facilitating entry into new states 
on july   we entered into an asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement  pursuant to which we acquired the operations and certain assets of advantage health systems  inc  a south carolina corporation advantage 
advantage is a provider of home and community based services in south carolina and georgia  which expanded our services across states 
the total consideration payable pursuant to the purchase agreement was million  comprised of million in cash  common stock consideration with a deemed value of million resulting in the issuance of  common shares  a maximum of million in future cash consideration subject to the achievement of certain performance targets set forth in an earn out agreement and the assumption of certain specified liabilities

our series a preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock in connection with the completion of our ipo on november  we paid million of the million outstanding accumulated dividends as of november  with the remaining million being converted into junior subordinated promissory notes  which we refer to as the dividend notes 
the dividends notes were subordinated and junior to all obligations under our credit facility 
our dividend notes were repaid in full during the fourth quarter of off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet guarantees or arrangements with unconsolidated entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expense and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other sources and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider the items discussed below to be critical because of their impact on operations and their application requires our judgment and estimates 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenues for and from continuing operations are derived from medicaid and medicaid waiver programs under agreements with various state and local authorities 
these agreements provide for a service term from one year to an indefinite term 
services are provided based on authorized hours  determined by the relevant state or local agency  at an hourly rate specified in the agreement or fixed by legislation 
services to other payors  such as private or commercial clients  are provided at negotiated hourly rates and recognized in net service revenues as services are provided 
we provide for appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts at the time the services are rendered 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we are paid for our services primarily by state and local agencies under medicaid or medicaid waiver programs  medicare  commercial insurance companies and private individuals 
while our accounts receivable are uncollateralized  our credit risk is somewhat limited due to the significance of governmental payors to our results of operations 
laws and regulations governing the governmental programs in which we participate are complex and subject to interpretation 
amounts collected may be different than amounts billed due to client eligibility 
table of contents issues  insufficient or incomplete documentation  services at levels other than authorized and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
legislation enacted in illinois entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time 
as the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain  the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the income statement caption  interest income 
we received approximately million and million in prompt payment interest in and  respectively 
while we may be owed additional prompt payment interest  the amount and timing of receipt of such payments remains uncertain and we have determined that we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income when received 
we establish our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated and recorded primarily by aging receivables utilizing eight aging categories and applying our historical collection rates to each aging category  taking into consideration factors that might impact the use of historical collection rates or payor groups  with certain large payors analyzed separately from other payor groups 
in our evaluation of these estimates  we also consider delays in payment trends in individual states due to budget or funding issues  billing conversions related to acquisitions or internal systems  resubmission of bills with required documentation and disputes with specific payors 
historically  we have not experienced any write off of accounts as a result of a state operating with budget deficits 
while we regularly monitor state budget and funding developments for the states in which we operate  we consider losses due to state credit risk on outstanding balances as remote 
we believe that our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover potential losses  however  actual collections in subsequent periods may require changes to our estimates 
goodwill our carrying value of goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired from various acquisitions  including the acquisition of addus healthcare  inc in accordance with asc topic  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis  as of october  or whenever potential impairment triggers occur  such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
we may use a qualitative test  known as step or a two step quantitative method to determine whether impairment has occurred 
we can elect to perform step an optional qualitative analysis and based on the results skip the remaining two steps 
in  we elected to implement step and were not required to conduct the remaining two step analysis 
in  the company elected to evaluate the goodwill via the two step methodology 
the first step in the evaluation of goodwill impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to the recorded value  including goodwill 
we used the combination of a discounted cash flow model dcf model and the market multiple analysis method to determine the current fair value of each reporting unit 
the dcf model was prepared using revenue and expense projections based on our current operating plan 
as such  a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast revenue growth  price changes  gross profits  operating expenses and operating cash flows 
the cash flows were discounted using a weighted average cost of capital of  which was management s best estimate based on our capital structure and external industry data 
as part of the second step of this evaluation  if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized 
in light of the current federal and state economic and reimbursement environments and state budgetary pressures to decrease or eliminate services provided by us  we completed a preliminary assessment of the fair value of our two reporting units  home community continuing operations and home health discontinued operations  and the potential for goodwill impairment as of june  our total stockholders equity as of 
table of contents september  was significantly greater than our market capitalization  which was approximately million based on  shares of common stock outstanding as of september  while the market capitalization of approximately million was below our stockholders equity  the market capitalization metric is only one indicator of fair value 
in our opinion  the market capitalization approach  by itself  is not a reliable indicator of the value for our company 
based on the above factors and updates to our business projections and forecasts  and other factors  we determined that the estimated fair value of our discontinued operations was less than the net book value indicating that its allocated goodwill was impaired 
the preliminary assessment for our continuing operations indicated that its fair value was greater than its net book value with no initial indication of goodwill impairment 
as permitted by asc topic  when an impairment indicator arises toward the end of an interim reporting period  we may recognize our best estimate of that impairment loss 
based on our preliminary analysis prepared as of june   we determined that all of the million allocated to goodwill for the discontinued operations as of september  was impaired and we recorded a goodwill impairment loss in the third quarter of the goodwill impairment charge was noncash in nature and did not affect our liquidity or cash flows from operating activities 
additionally  the goodwill impairment had no effect on our borrowing availability or covenants under our credit facility agreement 
the preliminary analysis prepared as of june  was subject to the completion of our annual impairment test as of october  we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  and determined that no additional impairment charges or adjustments were required 
the goodwill for our continuing operations was million 
continuing operations had fair values in excess of carrying amounts of approximately million  or as of october  long lived assets we review our long lived assets and finite lived intangibles for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
to determine if impairment exists  we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the related long lived assets to the net carrying amount of such assets 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset  generally determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows 
no impairment was recorded in based on our assessment of fair value discussed above  we determined that all of the million allocated to the discontinued operations finite lived intangibles were impaired 
indefinite lived assets we also have indefinite lived assets that are not subject to amortization expense such as certificates of need and licenses to conduct specific operations within geographic markets 
our management has concluded that certificates of need and licenses have indefinite lives  as management has determined that there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  economic or other factors that would limit the useful life of these intangible assets and we intend to renew and operate the certificates of need and licenses indefinitely 
the certificates of need and licenses are tested annually for impairment 
no impairment was recorded in based on our assessment of fair value discussed above  we determined that all of the million allocated to discontinued operations certificates of need and licenses were impaired and recorded an impairment loss for workers compensation program our workers compensation insurance program has a million deductible component 
we recognize our obligations associated with this program in the period the claim is incurred 
the cost of both the claims reported and claims incurred but not reported  up to the deductible  have been accrued based on historical claims experience  
table of contents industry statistics and an actuarial analysis performed by an independent third party 
we monitor our claims quarterly and adjust our reserves accordingly 
these costs are recorded primarily in the cost of services caption in the consolidated statement of operations 
under the agreement pursuant to which we acquired addus healthcare  claims under our workers compensation insurance program that relate to december  or earlier are the responsibility of the selling shareholders in the acquisition  subject to certain limitations 
in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  health care entities topic  presentation of insurance claims and related insurance recoveries asu  which clarifies that companies should not net insurance recoveries against a related claim liability 
additionally  the amount of the claim liability should be determined without consideration of insurance recoveries 
as of december  and december   we recorded million and million  respectively  in workers compensation insurance recovery receivables and a corresponding increase in its workers compensation liability 
the workers compensation insurance recovery receivable is included in our prepaid expenses and other current assets on the balance sheet 
interest income legislation enacted in illinois entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time 
as the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain  the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the statement of operations caption  interest income 
we received approximately million and million in prompt payment interest in and  respectively 
while we may be owed additional prompt payment interest  the amount and timing of receipt of such payments remains uncertain and we have determined that we will continue to recognize prompt payment interest income when received 
new accounting pronouncements we do not believe any recently issued  but not yet effective  accounting standards will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
contractual obligations and commitments we had outstanding letters of credit of million at december  these standby letters of credit benefit our third party insurer for our high deductible workers compensation insurance program 
the amount of the letters of credit is negotiated annually in conjunction with the insurance renewals 
we anticipate our commitment will increase as we continue to grow our business and more years become our responsibility as responsibility shifts from the former owners of addus healthcare to us 
the following table summarizes our cash contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands credit facility term loan contingent liability interest on all debt operating leases total contractual obligations interest is calculated at the applicable debt borrowing rate as of december  our credit facility was entered into on november  and matures on november  on march   we entered into the first amendment to our credit facility 
the first amendment i increased the 
table of contents maximum aggregate amount of revolving loans available to us by million to million  ii modified our maximum senior debt leverage ratio from to to to for the twelve month period ending march  and each twelve month period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter and iii increased the advance multiple used to determine the amount of the borrowing base from to to to on july   we entered into the second amendment to our credit facility 
the second amendment provided for a million term loan component of the credit facility  the proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the purchase price payable in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of advantage effective july  the term loan will be repaid in equal monthly installments which commenced in february interest on the new term loan under the credit facility is payable either at a floating rate equal to the day libor  plus an applicable margin of or the libor rate for term periods of one  two  three or six months plus a margin of 
interest will be paid monthly or at the end of the relevant interest period 
the term loan was repaid when due on january  impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate on our credit facility was on total indebtedness of million 
the impact on a increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease interest expense by million
