item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes 
in addition to historical information  some of the information in this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and involves risk and uncertainties 
for example  statements regarding our plans and strategy for our business  our expectations with respect to future financial performance  expense categories and levels  cash needs and liquidity sources are forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under the risk factors in part i  item a of this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of novel  life altering therapies for patients with debilitating  often fatal  rare diseases 
our first product  juxtapid lomitapide capsules  also referred to as lomitapide juxtapid  received marketing approval from the us fda on december   as an adjunct to a low fat diet and other lipid lowering treatments  including ldl apheresis where available  to reduce ldl c  tc  apo b and non hdl c in patients with hofh 
we launched juxtapid in the us in late january in the first quarter of  we submitted a maa to the ema requesting approval to market lomitapide as an adjunct to a low fat diet and other lipid lowering therapies  with or without apheresis  to reduce ldl c  tc  apo b and tg in adults with hofh 
in march  the ema accepted the maa for review with a review start date of march  we expect that our near term efforts will be focused on commercializing juxtapid as a treatment for hofh in the us  gaining regulatory approval of lomitapide for adult patients with hofh in the eu and in other international markets  and launching lomitapide in those countries in which we receive marketing approval  supporting and facilitating expanded access to juxtapid in countries where named patient sales supply or compassionate use can occur as a result of the fda approval of juxtapid  clinical development activities to support a potential marketing authorization application for lomitapide in hofh in japan  and activities in support of our planned clinical study of lomitapide in pediatric hofh patients 
we also expect to build our business in the future by acquiring rights to one or more product candidates targeted at life threatening or substantially debilitating rare diseases that leverage our infrastructure and expertise 
as of december   we had not generated any revenue from the sale of any product 
in the near term  our ability to generate revenues is entirely dependent upon sales of juxtapid in the us and in countries where juxtapid is available for sale on a named patient sale basis as a result of the approval of juxtapid in the us as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in january  we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of per share 
the net proceeds to us from this offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 

table of contents financial overview revenue as of december   we had not generated any revenue from sales of any product  including juxtapid 
research and development expenses since our inception  our research and development activities have primarily focused on the clinical development of juxtapid and regulatory activities directed at gaining approval of juxtapid in hofh 
we recognize both internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred 
our research and development expenses have consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to contract research organizations cros  in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  including all related fees  such as for investigator grants  patient screening  laboratory work and statistical compilation and analysis  costs related to production of clinical materials  process validation and development efforts to support regulatory approval  including fees paid to contract manufacturers  costs related to upfront and milestone payments under in licensing agreements  costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements in the us  eu and other foreign jurisdictions  consulting fees paid to third parties  and costs related to stock based compensation granted to personnel in development functions 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made 
our research and development expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
our planned research and development activities  including those related to completing the process validation of our drug product  the conduct of non clinical studies directed toward the possible expansion of the juxtapid label to include pediatric patients and clinical studies directed towards a potential filing for regulatory approval of juxtapid in japan  may take several years or more to complete 
the length of time generally varies according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of such a project 
although we have received marketing approval for juxtapid from the fda  we have not yet received marketing approval from the ema  or any other foreign regulatory authority 
obtaining marketing approval is an extensive  lengthy  expensive and uncertain process  and the ema or any other foreign regulatory authority  may delay  limit or deny approval of juxtapid for many reasons 
our expenses related to development activities  including manufacturing and conducting clinical trials  are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with contract manufacturing organizations and with multiple research institutions and cros that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price 
payments under the clinical contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
we generally accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
if timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed  we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis 

table of contents as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of our development projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and operational functions  including finance  human resources  information technology  sales and marketing and legal 
other significant costs include costs related to stock based compensation related to options granted to personnel in executive and operational functions  and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents 
interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense consists primarily of cash and non cash interest costs related to our outstanding debt 
non cash interest expense consists of the amortization of capitalized costs incurred in connection with the issuance of debt 
we amortize these costs over the life of our debt agreements as interest expense in our statements of operations 
net operating losses and tax carryforwards as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million available to offset future taxable income 
these federal net operating loss and federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates starting in  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes that could limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards 
we have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred  or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our inception 
accordingly  we expect our ability to utilize the aforementioned carryforwards may be limited 
additionally  us tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be utilized against future taxes 
as a result  we may not be able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing in item of this form k  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our applicable personnel as well as applicable vendor personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating 
table of contents the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers  and make adjustments if necessary 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include salary and related employee compensation costs  fees paid to consultants helping us to launch juxtapid as a treatment for hofh in the us fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of juxtapid  including fill finish capabilities and for the manufacture of our validation runs  fees paid to contract research organizations and investigative sites in connection with clinical studies  and professional service fees 
valuation of financial instruments we regularly invest excess operating cash in deposits with major financial institutions  money market funds  notes issued by the us government and us and non us corporations  as well as fixed income investments and us bond funds  both of which can be readily purchased and sold using established markets 
the carrying amounts of these marketable securities are generally considered to be representative of their respective fair values based upon pricing of securities with similar investment characteristics and holdings 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is mitigated as many of these securities are government backed or of high credit quality 
stock based compensation we measure the fair value of stock options and other stock based compensation issued to employees and directors on the date of grant 
the fair value of equity instruments issued to non employees are remeasured as the award vests 
for service type awards  compensation expense is recognized using the straight line method over the requisite service period  which is typically the vesting period 
for awards that vest or begin vesting upon achievement of a performance condition  we begin recognizing compensation expense when achievement of the performance condition is deemed probable and recognize compensation expense using an accelerated attribution method over the implicit service period 
for equity awards that have previously been modified  any incremental increase in the fair value over the original award has been recorded as compensation expense on the date of the modification for vested awards or over the remaining service vesting period for unvested awards 
the incremental compensation cost is the excess of the fair value based measure of the modified award on the date of modification over the fair value based measure of the original award immediately before the modification 
we recorded stock based compensation expense in our statement of operations as follows years ended december  in thousands selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring costs total 
table of contents we calculate the estimated fair value of stock based compensation awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility and the expected life of stock options 
as a recent public company  we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock price or the expected life of our options 
we calculate expected volatility based on reported data for selected reasonably similar publicly traded companies  or guideline peer group  for which the historical information is available 
we will continue to use the guideline peer group volatility information until the historical volatility of our common stock is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the assumed dividend yield is based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we determine the average expected life of stock options according to the simplified method as described in staff accounting bulletin  which is the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
we determine the risk free interest rate by reference to implied yields available from five year and seven year us treasury securities with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical analysis of actual stock option forfeitures 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model are as follows years ended december  risk free interest rate dividend yield weighted average expected life of options years volatility there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate stock based compensation 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee stock based awards is determined using an option pricing model  the calculated value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a market transaction between a willing buyer and willing seller 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions when valuing our options  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have historically reported 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and the following table summarizes the results of our operations for each of the years ended december  and  together with the changes in those items in dollars and as a percentage years ended december  change in thousands costs and expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring costs total costs and expenses loss from operations interest expense interest income other expense income  net net loss 
table of contents revenue we did not recognize any revenue for the years ended december  or  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily attributable to increases of million in manufacturing validation expenses  million in salary and other employee related compensation costs  million in outside service expenses  and million in stock based compensation expense  offset in part by decreases of million in pre clinical and clinical trial expenses and million in consulting expenses 
the increase in manufacturing validation expenses was due to completion of our drug substance validation campaign in the increases in salary and related employee related compensation costs and stock based compensation expense were primarily due to an increase in research and development headcount and an annualization of costs for those employees hired in the increases in outside service expenses were due to resources devoted to regulatory work and related activities in connection with our nda and other lomitapide regulatory filings 
the decrease in both clinical trial costs and consulting expenses is due to the substantial completion of our pivotal clinical trial for juxtapid in we expect research and development costs will increase in as compared to as a result of increases in headcount  primarily in our medical affairs function  our planned clinical development activities to support a marketing authorization application for juxtapid in hofh in japan  activities in support of our planned clinical study of juxtapid in pediatric hofh patients  future international regulatory filings for juxtapid and other possible clinical development activities and post marketing commitments 
due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and costs to conduct clinical trials and related activities  we cannot determine these future expenses with certainty and the actual amounts may vary significantly from our forecasts 
generally  inventory may be capitalized if it is probable that future revenue will be generated from the sale of the inventory and that these revenues will exceed the cost of the inventory 
since the approval of juxtapid in the us in december and subsequent product launch in january the company evaluated whether a portion of its costs incurred for manufacturing validation runs may be capitalized as inventory 
in  we expensed the costs of our manufacturing validation runs due to the high risk inherent in drug development and uncertainty as to whether lomitapide would be approved and ultimately saleable 
selling general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to an million increase in salary and employee related compensation costs  a million increase in stock based compensation expense and a million increase in outsourced services and consulting expenses  which includes pre launch sales and marketing expenditures  and legal  accounting and auditing fees 
these increases were primarily due to the build out of the sales  marketing and general and administrative functions and related headcount as well as costs incurred to prepare for the commercial launch of juxtapid 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in due to the annualization of costs for those sales and marketing employees hired throughout  continued activities related to the commercialization of juxtapid in the us  and the building of our commercial infrastructure in countries outside the us in anticipation of both named patient sales efforts and of a possible future launch in those countries 
these increases will likely include increased costs for additional sales and marketing personnel  including sales representatives and reimbursement case managers  as well as additional costs associated with the establishment of our international distribution channel for juxtapid 

table of contents restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of  we consolidated facilities and related administrative functions into our cambridge headquarters 
as a result  we closed our bedminster  new jersey office  effective december   and reduced headcount by five positions 
restructuring costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in the restructuring charges are million and million of employee severance and outplacement services costs for five employees  primarily in general and administrative positions  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  we accelerated the vesting of  total stock options granted in  and to the former new jersey employees upon the termination of their employment 
as such  we recognized expense related to those stock options based on the fair value of the stock options at the date of the modification of each award 
we expensed the value of the modification over the remaining service periods for each of the employees 
we recognized approximately million and million of stock compensation expense related to these modifications for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in january  we entered into a sublease agreement for the bedminster  new jersey facility for the remaining term of the lease 
in determining the ongoing facilities charge  we considered our sublease arrangement for the facility  including sublease terms and the sublease rates 
we will record ongoing restructuring charges of approximately  related to the remaining lease obligation through july interest expense interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million decrease was primarily due to the reduced interest rate associated with the silicon valley bank silicon valley bank term loan compared to our loan with hercules technology  ii  lp and hercules iii  lp collectively  the hercules funds that was repaid in the first quarter of interest income interest income was million for both of the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expense income for the year ended december  other expense was million primarily attributable to charges incurred in relation to the early repayment of our million loan to the hercules funds 
for the year ended december   other income was million  primarily attributable to a gain on sale of our long term investment in an auction rate security and an auction rate security converted to preferred stock

research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased expenses related to our lomitapide development program  including increases of million in clinical trial costs  million in clinical consultant expenses  million in employee salary and related compensation costs  million in process development manufacturing and million in pre clinical expenses 
in addition  stock based compensation expense increased million 
these increases were due to increased headcount  the advancement of the clinical development program for lomitapide as well as the advancement of the regulatory work and related preparations for the filing of our nda and maa for lomitapide 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily attributable to increases of million in stock based compensation expense  million in professional services expenses  million in compensation costs  and million for facility related expenses 
these increases are mainly due to building out our management team and related stock based compensation costs  as well as the costs associated with operating as a public company 
restructuring costs restructuring costs of million in were related to closure of our bedminster  new jersey facility 
included in the restructuring charges are million of employee severance and outplacement services costs for five employees  primarily in general and administrative positions  million representing the net present value of the remaining lease obligation for our bedminster  new jersey facility and a net write off of million of fixed assets  primarily computer equipment and leasehold improvements  that were no longer in use after vacating the facility 
we also recorded million of non cash restructuring charges related to the modification of stock options for former employees in 
table of contents interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million decrease was primarily due to the write off of non cash deferred financing fees associated with the conversion of our preferred stock and convertible notes into shares of common stock at the closing of our initial public offering in interest income interest income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase was due to higher cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances subsequent to our public offerings in late and change in fair value of warrant liability we recorded million of other expense during the year ended december  due to the revaluation of our preferred stock warrant to fair value prior to its conversion to a warrant to purchase common stock upon the closing of our ipo 
other income other income was million for the year ended december   primarily attributable to the gain on sales of our long term investment in an auction rate security and an auction rate security converted to preferred stock 
other income for the year ended december  was million representing the receipt of funds from the us treasury department in for the qualified therapeutics discovery projects grant program 
benefit from income taxes we recorded a million income tax benefit during the year ended december   representing proceeds from the sale of new jersey state net operating losses to a third party during the first half of liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from the private placement of convertible preferred stock  convertible debt  venture debt  bank debt and the proceeds from our public issuances of common stock

the loan and security agreement provides for interest only payments through february   with per annum interest of and a final payment of million 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to repay our existing loan from the hercules funds 
the loan and security agreement provides that we shall repay the principal balance of the term loan in equal monthly installments starting on march  and continuing through february  the remaining term loan principal balance and all accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable on february  at our option  we may prepay all or any part of the outstanding term loan subject to a prepayment premium defined in the loan and security agreement

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period total and and and thereafter long term debt including interest operating lease obligations total this table does not include a any milestone payments which may become payable to third parties under license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known  b any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts  timing and likelihood of such payments are not known and c contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business which are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above 
we currently purchase supplies of drug substance and drug product from our contract manufacturers under the applicable commercial supply agreement 
as of december   we had approximately million committed for contract manufacturing costs 
we expect these amounts will be paid during in march  we filed an nda for juxtapid in the us as a treatment for hofh  and paid upenn a  milestone payment under the license agreement 
in december  we received marketing approval for juxtapid in the us as a treatment for hofh  and accrued million  at december   for payment of the final hofh related milestone under the license agreement 
fifty percent of these milestone payments are creditable against future royalties on juxtapid sales  as defined in the license agreement  owed to upenn 
under our license agreement with upenn  we will also be required to make development milestone payments of up to an aggregate amount of million if we decide to develop lomitapide for indications within the licensed field other than hofh 
all such development milestone payments for these other indications are payable only once  no matter how many licensed products for these other indications are developed 
in addition  we are required to make specified royalty payments on net sales of products covered by the license subject to a variety of customary reductions  and share with upenn specified percentages of sublicensing royalties and other consideration that we receive under any sublicenses that we may grant 
lomitapide is a licensed product under the license agreement with upenn 
future funding requirements in the future  we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations 
our future capital requirements may be substantial  and will depend on many factors  including the level of physician  patient and payer acceptance of juxtapid  and the success of our commercialization efforts  the decisions of the ema with respect to our applications for marketing approval of juxtapid for the treatment of adult patients with hofh in the eu  the costs of activities related to the eu regulatory approval process  the timing of approvals in the eu if received  and the nature and timing of pricing approvals of the various countries in the eu  the decisions of various countries outside the us and eu with respect to approval of lomitapide  and reimbursement and pricing decisions in such countries  if approved  
table of contents the timing and cost of the planned juvenile animal toxicology study  and an anticipated clinical trial to evaluate juxtapid for treatment of pediatric patients with hofh  the cost of establishing and maintaining the sales and marketing capabilities necessary for commercial launch of juxtapid in hofh in the us and in the eu and certain other key international markets  if approved  the timing and cost of our planned clinical development program of juxtapid in hofh in japanese patients  the cost of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  the costs of our manufacturing related activities  the costs associated with commercializing juxtapid  the levels  timing and collection of revenue received from sales of approved products in the future  the cost of our observational cohort study as part of our post marketing commitments to the fda  the timing and cost of other clinical development activities  and the timing and costs of future business development opportunities 
in june  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock at a price to the public of pursuant to a form s registration statement 
the net proceeds to us from this offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering expenses 
in july  the underwriters exercised their overallotment option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds to us from the issuance and sale of the over allotment shares were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering expenses 
on january   we completed an underwritten public offering of  common shares at a price to the public of per share pursuant to a form s registration statement 
the net proceeds to us from this offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
we currently intend to use the net proceeds of these offerings to fund activities directed at commercial launch of juxtapid in the us  pursuing approval of our maa submission with the ema for lomitapide  and  if it is approved  commercial activities in the eu  expansion of operations in certain countries to pursue regulatory approval of lomitapide and to conduct sales on a named patient sales basis  where permitted  advancement of the clinical development of juxtapid  and business development activities  with any remainder to fund working capital  capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes 
on february   we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on form s asr with the securities and exchange commission sec  which became immediately effective 
this shelf registration statement permits us to offer  from time to time  an unspecified amount of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned activities which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon equity and debt market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  on the extent of our commercial success and our continued progress in our regulatory and development activities 
there can be no assurance that external funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
as of december   we had not generated any revenue 
we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in cash used in operations at least through and potentially in subsequent years 
we anticipate our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to enable us to maintain our currently planned operations  including our continued product development  until we are profitable 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments
