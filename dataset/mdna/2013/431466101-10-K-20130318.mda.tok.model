table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our revenue consists of two components consulting fee revenue cfr and reimbursable expenses 
reimbursable expenses are reflected in equal amounts in both total revenue and total direct expenses 
because these pass through revenue costs are subject to significant fluctuation from year to year  we measure the performance of many of our key operating metrics as a percentage of cfr  as we believe that this is a better and more consistent measure of operating performance than total revenue 
cfr increased  or  to  in cfr for the project management segment increased  principally due to increased work in the middle east  primarily saudi arabia  partially offset by a decrease in libya 
cfr for the construction claims segment decreased  due primarily to a decrease in work in australia 
cost of services increased  or  to  in as a result of an increase in employees and other direct expenses related to the additional work in the middle east 
gross profit increased  or  to  in due to the increases in cfr 
gross profit as a percent of cfr remained relatively constant at in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or  principally due to our cost cutting initiatives as well as a decrease in amortization expense  offset by the establishment of a  reserve for potential employment taxes for certain foreign subsidiaries 
operating profit was  in compared to an operating loss of  in income tax expense was  for compared to an income tax benefit of  for the change is primarily the result of an increase of  in the reserve against the company s us deferred tax asset 
net loss attributable to hill was  in compared to a net loss of  in diluted loss per common share was in based upon  diluted common shares outstanding compared to in based upon  diluted common shares outstanding 
we currently have open contracts in libya 
due to the political unrest which commenced there in february  we suspended our operations in  and demobilized substantially all of our personnel from libya 
although we reopened our office there in november  we are unable to predict when  or if  the work will resume 
at december   the accounts receivable related to the work performed under contracts in the region was approximately  we are unable to determine the effect the political and economic uncertainty will have on the collectibility of the accounts receivable 
we believe that the amounts due will be collected  however  if we are unable to do so  there could be a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and liquidity 
despite continuing global economic uncertainty and current limits to financial credit  we remain optimistic about maintaining our current growth strategy to pursue new business development opportunities  continue to take advantage of organic growth opportunities  continue to pursue acquisitions and strengthen our professional resources 
among other things  our optimism stems from the growth of our backlog at december  our total backlog is a record  an increase of  from september  and  from december  our month backlog is also a record  an increase of  from september  and  from december  these increases are primarily related to new work in oman  qatar and saudi arabia 

table of contents non gaap financial measures regulation g  conditions for use of non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
we believe earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  in addition to operating profit  net earnings and other gaap measures  is a useful indicator of our financial and operating performance and our ability to generate cash flows from operations that are available for taxes and capital expenditures 
this measure  however  should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute or superior to  operating profit  cash flows  or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
the following table is a reconciliation of ebitda to the most directly comparable gaap measure in accordance with sec regulation s k for the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  net loss earnings attributable to hill interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make subjective decisions  assessments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the judgment increases  such judgments become even more subjective 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable and appropriate  actual results may be materially different than estimated 
revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from providing professional services to our clients 
revenue is generally recognized upon the performance of services 
in providing these services  we may incur reimbursable expenses  which consist of amounts paid to subcontractors and other third parties as well as travel and other job related expenses that are contractually reimbursable from clients 
we will include reimbursable expenses in computing and reporting our total contract revenue as long as we remain responsible to the client for the fulfillment of the contract and for the overall acceptability of all services provided 
we earn our revenue from cost plus  fixed price and time and materials contracts 
if estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss  we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss becomes known 
the cumulative effect of revisions to revenue  estimated costs to complete contracts  including penalties  incentive awards  change orders  claims  anticipated losses  and other effects are recorded in the accounting period in which the events indicating a loss are known and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
such revisions could occur at any time and the effects may be material 
the majority of our contracts are for work where we bill the client monthly at hourly billing rates 
the hourly billing rates are determined by contract terms 
for governmental clients  the hourly rates are generally calculated as either i a negotiated multiplier of our direct labor costs or ii as direct labor costs plus overhead costs plus a negotiated profit percentage 
for commercial clients  the hourly rates are generally taken from a standard fee schedule by staff classification or they can be at a negotiated discount from this schedule 
in some cases  primarily for foreign work  a fixed monthly staff rate is negotiated rather than an hourly rate 
this monthly rate is determined based upon a buildup of direct labor costs plus overhead and profit 
we account for these contracts on a time and expenses method  recognizing revenue as costs are incurred 

table of contents we account for fixed price contracts on the percentage of completion method  wherein revenue is recognized as costs are incurred 
under the percentage of completion method for revenue recognition  we estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to be recognized 
we generally utilize a cost to cost approach in applying the percentage of completion method  where revenue is earned in proportion to total costs incurred divided by total costs expected to be incurred 
under the percentage of completion method  recognition of profit is dependent upon the accuracy of estimates 
we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of contract revenue  the extent of progress towards completion and contract completion costs on our long term construction management contracts 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual completion costs may vary from estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
estimates used in determining accounts receivable allowances are based on specific client account reviews and historical experience of credit losses 
we also apply judgment including assessments about changes in economic conditions  concentration of receivables among clients and industries  recent write off trends  rates of bankruptcy  and credit quality of specific clients 
unanticipated changes in the financial condition of clients  the resolution of various disputes  or significant changes in the economy could impact the reserves required 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested annually for impairment in our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment 
we have determined that we have two reporting units  the project management unit and the construction claims unit 
we made that determination based on the similarity of the services provided  the methodologies in delivering our services and the similarity of the client base in each of these units 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use the market approach and the income approach  weighting the results of each approach 
under the market approach  we determine fair value using the public company method and the quoted price method 
for our determination with respect to the current year  we utilized a control premium of to arrive at the preliminary fair value for each reporting unit  and we applied a weighting of to the preliminary fair value determined by using the public company method 
the quoted price method is based upon the market value of the transactions of minority interests in the publicly traded shares of the company 
for our determination with respect to the current year  we utilized a control premium of to arrive at the preliminary fair value for each reporting unit  and we applied a weighting of to the preliminary fair value determined using the quoted price method 
our calculation under the income approach utilizes our internal forecasts 
in the income approach that is  the discounted cash flow method  the projected cash flows reflect the cash flows subsequent to the sale of the reporting unit pursuant to the guidance in asc and asc consistent with applicable literature  we include in projected cash flows any expected improvements in cash flows or other changes that  in our view  a market participant would consider and be willing to pay for but we exclude any buyer or entity specific synergies 
the projections are developed by us and are based upon cash flows that maximize reporting unit value by taking into account improvements that controlling interest holders can make  but minority interest holders cannot make 
these improvements include increasing revenues  reducing operating costs  or reducing non operating costs such as taxes 
the owners of the enterprise may also increase enterprise value by reducing risk  for example  by diversifying the business  improving access to capital  increasing the certainty of cash flows  or optimizing the capital structure 
for our determination using the income approach with respect to july   we considered the factors listed above when developing the cash flows to support the income approach  but did not consider these factors when determining the value of a minority interest holder 
we made this distinction recognizing that the owner of a minority interest in a company is unlikely to be able to influence the operating and financial policies of that company 
recognizing that due to 
table of contents elements of control incorporated into our reporting units forecasts  we applied no control premium to our conclusion of value indicated by the discounted cash flows 
in determining fair value  we applied a weighting of to the preliminary fair value determined using the income approach 
with regard to weighting the conclusions rendered by the approaches utilized  we believe that the quoted price method provides the most reliable indication of value that is  a level input  therefore  we placed the greatest emphasis upon this method assigning a weighting 
we also determined that the value using the discounted cash flow method to which we assigned a weighting provided a more reliable indication of value than the public company method to which we assigned a weighting with the relative levels of reliability contributing to the weighting accorded to each approach 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for each reporting unit  the period over which cash flows will occur  and determination of the weighted average cost of capital  among other things 
based on the valuation as of july   the fair values of the project management unit and the construction claims unit substantially exceeded their carrying values 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect our determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
changes in future market conditions  our business strategy  or other factors could impact upon the future values of hill s reporting units  which could result in future impairment charges 
we amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives and review the long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  their amount and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available 
we use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals  as appropriate  to determine fair value 
we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
income taxes we make judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws  published tax guidance  as well as estimates of future earnings 
these judgments and interpretations affect the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets to determine on the basis of objective factors whether the net assets will be realized through future years taxable income 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates and assessments  additional valuation allowances may be required 
at december   we evaluated the deferred tax asset related to our us net operating losses 
due to three consecutive years of us based net operating losses  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize the majority of our deferred tax assets with the exception of certain foreign deferred tax assets 
as a consequence  we established a valuation allowance against our entire us based deferred tax asset 
we will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management s assessment is that the position is more likely than not ie  a likelihood greater than percent to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position 
the term tax position refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods 
stock options we recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards 
these awards have included stock options and restricted stock grants 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option 
table of contents pricing model to estimate the fair value of options 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including but not limited to stock price volatility  expected life and stock option exercise behavior 
contingencies estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to insurance claims that fall below policy deductibles and to litigation and other legal claims and contingencies  as well as in determining our liabilities for incurred but not reported insurance claims 
significant judgments by us and reliance on third party experts are utilized in determining probable and or reasonably estimable amounts to be recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
the results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which the changes are determined 
we do not believe that material changes to these estimates are reasonably likely to occur
