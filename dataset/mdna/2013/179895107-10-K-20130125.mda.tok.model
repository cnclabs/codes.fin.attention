table of contents versus net sales net sales decreased million  or less than one percent  in compared to the decrease in net sales in primarily reflects the effect of our fiscal year having one less week than our fiscal year  a decline in sales at our packaging segment and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates  partly offset by increased sales volume at our engine mobile filtration and industrial environmental filtration segments on a combined basis  increased selling prices and increased sales from business acquisitions 
components of the less than one percent decrease in net sales are as follows additional week in packaging segment volume foreign exchange filtration segments combined volume pricing acquisitions the effect of our fiscal year having one less week than our fiscal year unfavorably impacted net sales by approximately 
excluding the impact of the additional week in and changes in pricing  net sales at our packaging segment were lower in than in  primarily driven by lower sales of smokeless tobacco and confection packaging products and lower sales of decorated flat sheet metal products 
changes in the average exchange rates for foreign currencies versus the us dollar unfavorably impacted our translated us dollar value of net sales by in compared to  primarily due to strengthening of the us dollar compared to the euro during net sales in our engine mobile and industrial environmental filtration segments increased on a combined basis in compared to  excluding the effects of the additional week in  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in pricing and acquisitions 
this increase was primarily driven by an increase in natural gas vessel and aftermarket sales in the us and internationally  increased domestic sales of commercial and industrial filters through our total filtration services distribution business  and increased sales of dust collection cartridges and systems 
net sales increased approximately in compared to due to business acquisitions  reflecting our acquisitions of modular engineering pty ltd in the second quarter of and pdda filtration  inc in the first quarter of cost of sales cost of sales decreased million  or less than one percent  in compared to this less than one percent decrease in cost of sales was primarily the result of the less than one percent decrease in net sales 
our gross margin percentage in was percentage points lower than the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower absorption of fixed overhead costs in our packaging segment due to an decline in net sales in compared to  partly offset by benefits from our ongoing cost reduction and continuous improvement initiatives across each of our businesses 
raw material costs as a percentage of sales remained relatively stable in  as we were able to increase the selling prices of our products by approximately in to effectively pass through higher commodity costs to our customers 
because the majority of our sales are into the aftermarket where we do not have long term contracts  we had the ability to pass the impact of commodity cost increases onto our customers in 
table of contents selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in compared to this decrease was primarily driven by a million decline in compensation related to our company wide profit sharing program and a million decline in legal expenses  partly offset by million higher employee costs to support our long term growth initiatives and million higher other selling and administrative expenses to support our domestic and international growth initiatives 
our incentive compensation programs are tied to the achievement of objective annual goals  including the amount by which the company after tax earnings exceeds the company cost of capital in relation to the assets under management control 
although our operating profit increased by in compared to and our diluted earnings per share was flat in compared to  our results were below our internal annual goals  resulting in the decrease in incentive compensation in compared to the million decline in legal expenses reflects the resolution during of certain legal matters  including the patent infringement lawsuit filed by donaldson company in versus net sales higher operating profit  net earnings and diluted earnings per share in compared with were primarily the result of a million  or  increase in net sales 
components of this increase in net sales are as follows volume pricing additional week in foreign exchange transweb acquisition net sales in our engine mobile filtration segment were higher in than primarily on the strength of higher heavy duty engine filter sales both in the us  where sales grew  and internationally  where sales grew 
net sales in our industrial environmental filtration segment were higher in than primarily based upon higher net sales in the us including sales from our acquisition of transweb  which was completed at the end of december net sales at our packaging segment were lower in than however  excluding the impact of a no margin tooling and equipment sale to one of our customers in  net sales at our packaging segment increased million  or  in compared with each of the segment growth rates referenced above include the effect of our fiscal year having one more week than our fiscal year  which favorably impacted net sales by approximately 
cost of sales our cost of sales increased million  or  from this increase in cost of sales was primarily the result of the increase in net sales 
our gross margin percentage in was percentage points higher than this increase in gross margin percentage was primarily the result of our ability to leverage manufacturing overhead while maintaining relatively stable raw material costs as a percentage of net sales as we were able to increase prices by approximately in to effectively pass through higher commodity costs to our customers 
because a majority of our sales are into the aftermarket where we do not have long term contracts  we had the ability to pass the impact of commodity cost increases onto our customers in selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  in from this increase was the result of million higher employee costs and million higher other selling and administrative expenses to support our domestic and international growth 
these higher selling and administrative expenses were partially offset by a million decline in compensation related to our company wide profit sharing program 
with selling and administrative expenses growing only while our net sales increased  we reduced our selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales to in from in

table of contents the fiscal non gaap financial measures shown below exclude the impact of having an additional week in our fourth quarter and fiscal year 
although the comparison of fiscal year data excluding the additional week in our fiscal is not a measure of financial performance under gaap  the company believes that providing these non gaap financial measures better enables readers of this annual report to understand and evaluate the company historical and prospective operating performance 
management believes that removing the impact of the additional week in provides a more comparable measure of the changes in net sales  operating profit  net earnings and diluted earnings per share in compared to vs dollars in thousands weeks weeks weeks change change net sales operating profit net earnings attributable to clarcor diluted earnings per common share attributable to clarcor percentages operating margin pt net earnings margin pt the additional week amounts shown are estimates based on the number of weeks in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and do not consider certain factors or allocations that may occur only on an annual basis 
the estimated amounts are based on the average week for the actual fourth quarter rather than the specific last week of the fourth quarter

these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  depreciation lives  inventory valuation  asset impairment recognition  business combination accounting  income taxes and pension and postretirement benefits 
these critical accounting policies may be affected by recent relevant accounting pronouncements discussed in the following section 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these critical accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  we believe the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
the following lists the most critical accounting estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements which require us to use significant judgment and estimates of amounts that are inherently uncertain goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at november  we had million of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  representing of our total assets 
at november  we had million of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  representing of our total assets 
we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
these reviews of fair value involve judgment and estimates of discount rates  terminal values  transaction multiples and future cash 
table of contents flows for the reporting units that may be impacted by future sales and operating results for the reporting units  market conditions and worldwide economic conditions 
all goodwill and intangibles are allocated to the reporting unit component at the time of acquisition 
we have determined that the reporting unit components meet the criteria for aggregation into five reporting units 
these reporting units are aggregated based upon similar economic characteristics  nature of products and services  nature of production processes  type of customers and distribution methods 
in performing our impairment reviews  we estimated the fair values of the aggregated reporting units using a present value method that discounted future cash flows using market participant based assumptions 
for our indefinite lived intangibles  we performed annual impairment tests using the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of our trademarks and trade names 
we further analyzed various discount rates  transaction and capital market multiples and cash flows for aggregated reporting units to assess the reasonableness of our estimates and assumptions 
we believe our valuation techniques and assumptions are reasonable for this purpose 
we have not materially changed our methodology for valuing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
the results of our analysis performed as of december  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value and  accordingly  no impairment existed 
there were no goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal years  or definite lived intangible assets at november  we had million of definite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  representing of our total assets 
at november  we had million of definite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  representing of our total assets 
we review definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable 
based on a year over year decline in the net sales of our transweb business  in the fourth quarter of we performed an impairment review of the related definite lived intangible assets million carrying value and determined that estimated future cash flows of the relevant asset group was substantially more than sufficient to cover the carrying value and no impairment existed 
our analysis includes management judgment and estimates related to the future cash flows  which we believe are reasonable 
allowance for losses on accounts receivable allowances for losses on customer accounts receivable balances are estimated based on economic conditions in the industries to which we sell and on historical experience by evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss  fluctuations in amounts owed and current payment trends 
our concentration of risk is also monitored and at the end of  the largest outstanding customer account balance was million and the five largest account balances totaled million 
the allowances provided are estimates that may be impacted by economic and market conditions which could have an effect on future allowance requirements and results of operations 
pensions our pension net periodic benefit expense and related obligations are determined using a number of significant actuarial assumptions  including those related to discount rates  long term rates of return on pension plan assets and rates of compensation increases 
the discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date  taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plans 
the discount rates used for each plan were based on the citigroup pension discount curve 
the projected benefit payments in each year were discounted using the appropriate spot rate from the curve 
for each plan  a single discount rate was determined that produced the same total discounted value 
that rate  rounded to basis points  was the discount rate selected for the plan 
at november  the discount rate used for the qualified plans for us employees and the discount rate used for the non qualified plans for us employees were selected as the best estimates of the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plans using high quality fixed income investments currently available rated aa or better and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical long term investment returns as well as future expectations given target investment asset allocations and current economic conditions 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases in salaries among continuing active participants accruing benefits under the qualified plan 
the mortality table for the qualified plans is determined based on the actuarial table that is most reflective of the expected mortality of the plan participants 
the mortality table adopted rp projected was developed for pension plans by a society of actuaries study 
the mortality table used for the nonqualified pension plan is specified by the plan agreement 
the assumptions are similarly determined for each pension obligation 
actual results and future obligations will vary based on changes in interest rates  stock and bond market valuations and employee compensation 

table of contents in  a reduction in the discount rate would result in additional expense of approximately million and a reduction in the expected return on plan assets would result in additional expense of approximately million for our qualified defined benefit pension plans for us covered employees 
interest rates and pension plan valuations may vary significantly based on worldwide economic conditions and asset investment decisions 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss of million at year end is due primarily to changes in assumptions related to discount rates and expected asset returns compared to actual asset returns 
this actuarial loss will be recognized as pension expense in the future over the average remaining service period of the employees in the plans

note i to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we are required to estimate and record income taxes payable for each of the us and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing accounting treatment between tax and book which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for federal  state and international tax transactions for which deductibility is subject to interpretation 
taxes payable and the related deferred tax differences may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes in tax rates and changes in taxable profits and losses 
reserves are also estimated for uncertain tax positions that are currently unresolved 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of such situations and believe that it is properly reserved 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amendments to its indefinite lived intangible assets impairment testing guidance to simplify how entities test for indefinite lived intangible asset impairments 
the objective of the amendments is to reduce cost and complexity by providing an entity with the option to make a qualitative assessment about the likelihood that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired to determine whether it should perform a quantitative impairment test 
the amendments also enhance the consistency of impairment testing guidance amount long lived asset categories by permitting an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to calculate the asset fair value when testing an indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment  which is equivalent to the impairment testing requirements for other long lived assets 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   although early adoption is permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance in fiscal year to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued amendments to its goodwill impairment testing guidance to simplify how entities test for goodwill impairments 
the amendments are intended to reduce complexity and cost by providing a company the option of making an initial qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment in determining whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
the amendments also include examples of events and circumstances that a company should consider in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   although early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this guidance in fiscal year to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amendments to its comprehensive income guidance to a improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting  b increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and c facilitate the convergence of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap with international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments require all non owner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the required amendments  pursuant to the guidance  must be applied retrospectively 
in december  the fasb issued amendments to defer certain presentation requirements of the initial guidance 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   although early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance in fiscal year will affect the presentation of the consolidated statements of earnings and the consolidated statements of shareholders equity  but will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk is primarily related to the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we may also be exposed to various market risks that arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business related to items such as the cost of raw materials and changes in inflation 
certain contractual relationships with customers and vendors mitigate risks from changes in raw material costs and currency exchange rate changes that arise from normal purchasing and normal sales activities 
interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to our financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash  cash equivalents and certain short term  highly liquid investments 
interest rate fluctuations could affect earnings  cash flows or the fair value of our financial liabilities 
our debt obligations are primarily at variable rates and are denominated in us dollars 
to minimize the long term costs of borrowing  we manage our interest rate risk by monitoring trends in rates as a basis for determining whether to enter into fixed rate or variable rate agreements and the duration of such agreements 
we mitigated our interest rate risk on our borrowing under our revolving line of credit in by entering into a fixed interest rate swap agreement at the beginning of which fixed our interest until january interest rate risk is not expected to be significant to us in fiscal year as amounts outstanding on our long term debt agreements are more than offset by cash and cash equivalents 
the primary interest rate risk will be driven by our return on cash and cash equivalents 
based upon the million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of  a change in interest rates could impact annual interest income by approximately million 
this change in interest income would increase or decrease as cash and cash equivalents increase or decrease 
foreign currency since we operate through subsidiaries in several countries around the world  our reported financial results of operations  including the reported value of assets and liabilities  are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk when the financial statements of our subsidiaries  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries outside the us are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period 
earnings and cash flows are translated at weighted average rates of exchange 
although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact  the translation changes may impact the overall value of net assets 
we are also exposed to transaction risk from changes in foreign currency rates through sales and purchasing transactions when we sell products in functional currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred 
the functional currencies of our worldwide facilities primarily include us dollar  euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar  chinese yuan renminbi  malaysian ringgit and mexican peso 
as these currencies fluctuate against each other  and other currencies  we are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk on sales and purchasing transactions 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is reduced through the maintenance of local production facilities in several markets that we serve  which we believe creates a natural hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in  the percentages of our net sales denominated in a currency other than the us dollar were as follows percentage of net sales functional currency euro british pound chinese yuan canadian dollar all other foreign currencies 
table of contents currency exchange rates vary daily and often one currency strengthens against the us dollar while another currency weakens 
because of the complex interrelationship of the worldwide supply chains and distribution channels  it is difficult to quantify the impact of a particular change in exchange rates 
however  if the us dollar strengthened or weakened relative to the currencies where our foreign income and cash flows are derived  the estimated effect on the consolidated results of operations would be per diluted share based upon results 
the effect of changes in the average foreign currency translation rates in compared to unfavorably impacted our operating profit by approximately million in commodity prices we are exposed to changing commodity prices  including but not limited to  steel  filter media  resins and other chemicals 
historically  since a large majority of our business units deal with aftermarket customers as opposed to first fit or oem customers where we have greater control of pricing  we have been able to successfully pass significant commodity price increases onto our customers 
in addition  due to the nature of our aftermarket filtration products  we believe our customer demand is rather inelastic  meaning reasonable price increases do not significantly impact customer demand 
in addition  our business units which manufacture filtration vessels or systems are typically able to time customer price quotations with steel purchases and are able to base quotations on actual steel costs 
if we were not able to pass through commodity price increases to our customers  we estimate a increase decrease in the price of all the commodities we purchase would increase decrease cost of sales and decrease increase operating profit by approximately million
