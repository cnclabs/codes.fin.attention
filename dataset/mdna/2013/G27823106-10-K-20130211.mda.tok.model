table of contents on october   we completed the acquisition of mvl 
mvl is a leading global manufacturer of automotive connection systems with a focus on high value  leading technology applications 
given the timing of the acquisition it is not fully reflected in our results and impacts comparability to and results 
on october   delphi automotive llp acquired the major portion of the business of the predecessor  and this business constituted the entirety of the operations of the successor 
the predecessor adopted the accounting guidance in financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc  reorganizations  effective october  and has segregated in the financial statements for all reporting periods subsequent to such date and through the acquisition on october  by delphi automotive llp and the emergence by old delphi from chapter our consolidated financial statements are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements of the predecessor due to the effects of the emergence from chapter and the change in the basis of presentation 
our management utilizes net income before depreciation and amortization including long lived asset and goodwill impairment  interest expense  other income expense  net  income tax expense and equity income  net of tax ebitda to evaluate performance 
ebitda was used as a performance indicator for the year ended december  through december   our management relied on adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure 
our management believed that net income before depreciation and amortization including long lived asset and goodwill impairment  interest expense  other income expense  net  income tax expense  equity income  net of tax  transformation and rationalization charges related to plant consolidations  plant wind downs and discontinued operations adjusted ebitda was a meaningful measure of performance and it was used by management and the board of managers of delphi automotive llp to analyze company and stand alone segment operating performance and for planning and forecasting purposes 
effective january   our management began utilizing ebitda as a key performance measure because our restructuring was substantially completed in ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered substitutes for results prepared in accordance with us gaap and should not be considered alternatives to net income loss attributable to successor predecessor  which is the most directly comparable financial measure to ebitda and adjusted ebitda that is in accordance with us gaap 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as determined and measured by us  should also not be compared to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to ebitda includes other transformation and rationalization costs related to the implementation of information technology systems to support finance  manufacturing and product development initiatives  certain plant consolidations and closures costs  consolidation of many staff administrative functions into a global business service group and the on going integration costs related to the acquisition of mvl 
the reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income loss attributable to successor predecessor follows successor predecessor year ended december  period from august to december  period from january to october  year ended december  adjusted ebitda transformation and rationalization charges employee termination benefits and other exit costs other transformation and rationalization costs ebitda depreciation and amortization goodwill impairment charges discontinued operations operating income loss interest expense other income expense  net reorganization items income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and equity income loss income tax expense benefit equity income loss  net of tax loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income loss attributable to successor predecessor ebitda margin is defined as ebitda as a percentage of revenues
