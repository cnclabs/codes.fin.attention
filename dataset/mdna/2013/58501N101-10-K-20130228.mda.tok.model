table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the exchange act 
we intend that these forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created by those provisions 
please see the section entitled forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report for important information you should know regarding these forward looking statements and how to identify them  including cautionary language regarding undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
we disclaim any intention or obligation to update  supplement or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the rapid development and commercialization of novel therapies to treat serious diseases for which there are limited treatment options 
we select technologies for development that meet three primary criteria the technology has a in the judgment of our scientific leadership  an above average likelihood of working  b strong intellectual property and or data exclusivity protection  and c the ability to target one or more serious diseases for which existing treatments are suboptimal 
when selecting technologies for development  we focus primarily on those we believe have the ability to enter human studies within months 
we consider technologies without regard to therapeutic indication or therapeutic modality ie  small molecules  biologics  medical devices  etc 
we may develop technologies through our own internal research activities  or in license technologies from academic institutions or other third parties 
once we select a technology for development  we seek to advance it quickly  strategically and cost effectively to commercialization 
our commercialization strategy for any of our product candidates that receives marketing approval will vary depending on the target customer base for that product candidate  our then current internal commercial capabilities  the extent to which we deem it prudent and cost effective to build additional internal commercial capabilities  and the availability  quality and cost of third party commercialization partners 
our most advanced program is xtandi enzalutamide capsules  or xtandi  which we have partnered with astellas pharma inc  or astellas 
we in licensed the intellectual property rights covering xtandi in  began our first clinical trial in  entered into our collaboration agreement with astellas  or the astellas collaboration agreement  in  reported positive phase overall survival data in in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  or mcrpc  who have previously received docetaxel  or post chemotherapy mcrpc patients  and on august   received regulatory approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  for the treatment of post chemotherapy mcrpc patients 
we and astellas began co promoting xtandi for that indication in the united states on september  marketing applications for xtandi for the treatment of post chemotherapy mcrpc patients are also under review in europe  south korea  canada  and brazil 
together with astellas  we are also conducting multiple trials of enzalutamide in earlier prostate cancer disease states  including the phase prevail trial in patients with mcrpc who have not received chemotherapy  or pre chemotherapy mcrpc patients  and in patients with breast cancer 
we also have ongoing programs with other agents in multiple different indications in the early stages of research and development 
these early stage programs are unpartnered 
in january  our former collaboration partner pfizer  inc  or pfizer  exercised its right to terminate our collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of our former product candidate dimebon for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington disease  due to negative phase trial results in both indications 
we and pfizer discontinued development of dimebon for all indications in january  and completed the wind down of our respective remaining collaboration activities in the third quarter of 
table of contents financial history on august   the fda approved xtandi for the treatment of post chemotherapy mcrpc patients 
this was the first marketing approval for xtandi anywhere in the world 
we and our collaboration partner astellas commenced commercial sales of xtandi in the us on september  we did not generate any collaboration revenue attributable to us xtandi sales until the quarter ended september  we have funded our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock  the issuance of our convertible senior notes due april   or the convertible notes  and from the up front  development milestone and cost sharing payments under the astellas collaboration agreement and our former collaboration agreement with pfizer 
we have incurred cumulative net losses of million through december   and expect to incur substantial additional losses as we continue to finance the commercialization of xtandi in the u 
s market  clinical and preclinical studies of xtandi and our early stage technologies  and our corporate overhead costs 
we do not know when  or if  xtandi will begin to generate profits in the us market  will be approved for sale in the us market for any indication other than treatment of post chemotherapy mcrpc patients  or will be approved for sale in any other market for any indication 
business highlights we presented positive results from our phase affirm trial in a podium presentation at the genitourinary cancers symposium 
in this trial  which enrolled approximately  men with post chemotherapy mcrpc  patients taking xtandi lived for a median of months longer than those taking placebo months versus months  p 
the results of our phase affirm trial were published in the new england journal of medicine 
the fda approved our application to market xtandi in the us to treat men with post chemotherapy mcrpc  and we and our collaboration partner astellas launched xtandi in the us for this indication 
the regulatory authorities in europe  south korea  canada  and brazil began reviewing marketing applications seeking approval to commercialize enzalutamide to treat post chemotherapy mcrpc in those jurisdictions 
we completed enrollment in our phase prevail trial  which is evaluating enzalutamide versus placebo in  men with mcrpc who have not yet received chemotherapy  or pre chemotherapy mcrpc 
prevail has co primary endpoints of overall survival and progression free survival 
we initiated clinical development of enzalutamide in breast cancer 
we and our former collaboration partner pfizer discontinued development of our former product candidate dimebon for all indications following negative phase results in both alzheimer s disease and huntington disease 
financial highlights net sales of xtandi for  as reported by astellas  were million  all of which occurred in the us these results represented us xtandi sales during the period from commercial launch on september  through december  collaboration revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year period 
the increase was driven primarily by development milestone payments from astellas million in  increased amortization of the up front payment we previously received from our former collaboration partner  pfizer  due to the termination of that collaboration million and increased revenue from us xtandi net sales due to the commercial launch of that product million 

table of contents total operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year period 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   an increase of million  or  from million at december  in march  we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in the footnotes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that certain of our accounting policies are critical because they are the most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies require our most subjective and complex judgments  often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies have been consistently applied during the periods presented 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap  and include the accounts of medivation  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
we operate in one business segment 
all tabular disclosures of dollar and share amounts are presented in thousands  unless otherwise indicated 
all per share amounts are presented at their actual amounts 
percentages and amounts presented herein may not calculate or sum precisely due to rounding 
the information of shares of common share except par value per share  par  additional paid in capital  and net loss per common share for all periods reflect the two for one forward stock split of our common stock  effective september  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock as a result of the two for one forward stock split 
the par value of our common stock remained unchanged at per share 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements applicable to us is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

table of contents collaboration agreements estimated performance periods both the astellas collaboration agreement and the former collaboration agreement with pfizer contain multiple elements and deliverables 
we evaluated the facts and circumstances of the collaboration agreements and concluded that we had multiple deliverables under both collaboration agreements  including deliverables relating to grants of technology licenses  and performance of manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development activities in the united states 
in the case of the astellas collaboration agreement  the period in which we perform our deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and at december   management estimated that it would be completed in the first quarter of in the case of the former collaboration agreement with pfizer  the period in which we performed our deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and concluded in the third quarter of upon completion of our performance obligations 
we also concluded that our deliverables under each collaboration agreement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
estimation of the performance periods of our deliverables requires the use of our management s judgment 
significant factors considered in management s evaluation of the estimated performance periods include  but are not limited to  our experience  along with our collaboration partners experience  in conducting manufacturing  clinical development and regulatory activities 
we review the estimated duration of our performance periods under our collaboration agreements on a quarterly basis and make any appropriate adjustments on a prospective basis 
future changes in estimates of the performance period under the astellas collaboration agreement could significantly impact the timing of future revenue recognition 
collaboration agreement payments we account for the various payment flows under our collaboration agreements in a consistent manner  as follows up front payments 
we received non refundable  up front cash payments of million and million under our collaboration agreement with astellas and our former collaboration agreement with pfizer  respectively 
we recognize these payments as collaboration revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable estimated performance period 
milestone payments 
we are eligible to receive milestone payments under the astellas collaboration agreement based on achievement of specified development  regulatory and commercial events 
we evaluated the nature of the events triggering these contingent payments  and concluded that these events fall into two categories a events which involve the performance of our obligations under the astellas collaboration agreement  and b events which do not involve the performance of our obligations under the astellas collaboration agreement 
the former category of milestone payments consists of those triggered by development and regulatory activities in the united states and by the acceptance for review of marketing applications in europe and japan 
we concluded that each of these payments  with one exception  constitute substantive milestones 
this conclusion was based primarily on the facts that i each triggering event represents a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by us of one or more of our deliverables  ii achievement of each triggering event was subject to inherent risk and uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to us  iii each of the milestone payments is non refundable  iv substantial effort is required to complete each milestone  v the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone  vi a substantial amount of time is expected to pass between the up front payment and the potential milestone payments  and vii the milestone payments relate solely to past performance 
based on the foregoing  we recognize any revenue from these milestone payments in the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs 
the one exception is the milestone payment for initiation of the phase prevail trial  an event which we deemed to be reasonably assured at the inception of the astellas collaboration 
this milestone payment was triggered in the third quarter of  and we are amortizing it as revenue on a straight line basis over the performance period of the astellas collaboration agreement 

table of contents the latter category of milestone payments consists of those triggered by potential regulatory approvals in europe and japan  and commercial activities globally  all of which are areas in which we have no pertinent contractual responsibilities under the astellas collaboration agreement 
we concluded that these payments constitute contingent revenues and thus recognize them as revenue in the period in which the contingency is met 
royalties and profit loss sharing payments 
under the astellas collaboration agreement  we share equally profit losses on sales of products in the united states and are eligible to receive royalties on sales of products outside the united states 
we consider these payments to be contingent revenues  and we recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is resolved 
cost sharing payments 
under both the astellas collaboration agreement and the former collaboration agreement with pfizer  we and our collaboration partners share certain development and commercialization costs including in the case of the astellas collaboration agreement  cost of goods sold and the royalty on net sales payable to the regents of the university of california  or ucla  under our license agreement with ucla in the united states 
the parties make quarterly cost sharing payments to one another in amounts necessary to ensure that each party bears its contractual share of the overall shared us development and commercialization costs incurred 
our policy is to account for cost sharing payments to our collaboration partners as increases in expense in our consolidated statements of operations  while cost sharing payments by our collaboration partners to us are accounted for as reductions in expense 
cost sharing payments related to development activities and commercialization activities are recorded in research and development expenses  or r d expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a expenses  respectively 
reliance on third party information 
under the astellas collaboration agreement  astellas records all xtandi sales globally and has operational responsibility for certain development and commercialization activities in the united states for which we share costs 
thus  astellas has control over certain xtandi related financial information needed to prepare our financial statements and related disclosures  including information regarding gross sales  net sales  gross to net deductions and shared us development and commercialization costs incurred by astellas 
we are dependent on astellas to provide us with such information in a timely and accurate manner for use in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
certain of this information provided by astellas is subject to estimates  including estimates used in determining gross to net deductions such as payor mix  discounts including legally mandated discounts to government entities  returns  chargebacks  rebates  and participation levels in patient assistance programs  and estimates regarding accrued development and commercialization costs incurred by astellas 
under the astellas collaboration agreement  such estimates are reassessed periodically and trued up as appropriate in accordance with astellas internal accounting policies  as consistently applied 
should astellas fail to provide us with any such financial information in a timely manner  or should any such financial information provided by astellas  or any of the estimates upon which such financial information was based  prove to be inaccurate  we could be required to record adjustments in future periods and may be required to restate our results for prior periods 
stock based compensation we have granted stock options  restricted stock units  performance share awards and stock appreciation rights pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated equity incentive award plan 
we account for stock based compensation expense associated with stock options by estimating their fair value using the black scholes valuation model on the grant date and amortizing the fair value over the applicable vesting period of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date  which equals the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
for restricted stock units  we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
performance share awards allow the recipients of such awards to earn fully vested shares of our common stock based on the achievement of pre established performance objectives 
stock based compensation expense associated with performance share awards is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date  
table of contents which equals the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date  and is recognized upon a point in which the performance objective is believed to be achieved 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis the probability of achieving the performance criteria 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share awards expected to be earned is recognized as compensation expense or as reduction of previously recognized compensation expense in the period of the revised estimate 
the fair value of stock settled and cash settled stock appreciation rights is initially measured on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model 
similar to stock options  compensation expense for stock settled stock appreciation rights is recognized over the vesting period of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest based on the grant date fair value 
cash settled stock appreciation rights are liability classified awards for which compensation expense and the associated liability are remeasured at each reporting date through the date of settlement based on the portion of the requisite service period rendered 
upon the conversion of cash settled stock appreciation rights to stock settled stock appreciation rights  the awards are remeasured using the then current black scholes assumptions and the remeasured liability is reclassified to additional paid in capital 
determining an estimate of the fair value of equity awards using the black scholes valuation model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option term  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the black scholes valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our stock options or stock appreciation rights 
if the model permitted consideration of the unique characteristics of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights  the resulting estimate of the fair value of the stock options and stock appreciation rights could be different 
in addition  if we had made different assumptions and estimates for use in the black scholes valuation model  the amount of recognized and to be recognized stock based compensation expense could have been different 
please refer to the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further information about the assumptions made by us and the impact of such assumptions 
we apply a forfeiture rate when determining stock based compensation expense to account for an estimate of the granted awards not expected to vest 
if actual forfeitures differ from the expected rate  we may be required to make additional adjustments to compensation expense in future periods 
research and development expense and accruals r d expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs  milestone related payments to the licensor of our enzalutamide technology  and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties to provide research and development services to us  costs are expensed as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include up front payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our accruals for clinical trials and other research and development activities are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and contract research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various research and development activities in the on going development of our product candidates  including without limitation  third party clinical trial centers and contract research organizations that perform and administer our clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under these agreements depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our consolidated financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials and other research and development activities are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific agreement 

table of contents our estimates are dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by third parties regarding the status and cost of studies  and may not match the actual services performed by these organizations 
this could result in adjustment to our research and development expense in future periods 
we have had no significant adjustments to previously recorded amounts 
litigation we are party to legal proceedings  investigations  and claims in the ordinary course of business 
we record accruals for outstanding legal matters when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
we evaluate  on a quarterly basis  developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable 
to the extent new information is obtained and our views on the probable outcomes of claims  suits  assessments  investigations or legal proceedings change  changes in our accrued liabilities would be recorded in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition  in accordance with the relevant authoritative guidance  for matters for which the likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible  we provide disclosure of the possible loss or range of loss  however  if a reasonable estimate cannot be made  we will provide disclosure to that effect 
convertible notes we account for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion by separating the liability and the equity components of the instruments in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when we recognize interest expense in subsequent periods 
the debt component of the convertible notes  which excludes the associated equity conversion feature  was recorded at fair value on the issuance date 
the equity component  representing the difference between the aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes and the fair value of the debt component  was recorded in additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheet 
the discount initially excluded from the carrying value of the convertible notes due to the bifurcation will be subsequently accreted to the convertible notes principal amount through the recognition of non cash interest expense 
costs related to the issuance of the convertible notes  consisting primarily of investment banking  legal and other professional fees were allocated to the debt and equity components of the convertible notes in proportion to the allocation of the principal proceeds 
amounts allocated to the debt component were capitalized and are being amortized as non cash interest expense using the effective yield method over the five year contract term of the convertible notes 
amounts allocated to the equity component were charged against additional paid in capital 
determining the fair value of the debt component of the convertible notes requires the use of management estimates and assumptions  including without limitation estimates of the fair value of similar debt instruments that do not include an equity conversion feature 
these estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  including the carrying value of the convertible notes  the associated debt discount  and the amounts of non cash interest expense reported 
income taxes we establish reserves for uncertain income tax positions based on the technical support for the position  our past audit experiences with similar situations  and potential interest and penalties related to the matters 
our recorded reserves represent our best estimate of the amount  if any  that we may ultimately be required to pay to settle such matters 
the resolution of our uncertain income tax positions is dependent on uncontrollable factors such as law changes  new case law  and the willingness of the income tax authorities to settle  including the timing thereof and other factors 
although we do not anticipate significant changes to our uncertain income tax positions in the next months  items outside of our control could cause our uncertain income tax positions to 
table of contents change in the future  which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
interest and or penalties related to income tax matters are recognized as a component of income tax expense as incurred 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets for the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
based on the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance  reported cumulative net losses since inception and continuing net loss  we have established and continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
results of operations collaboration revenue collaboration revenue consists of three components a collaboration revenue attributable to us xtandi sales  b collaboration revenue attributable to ex us xtandi sales  and c collaboration revenue attributable to up front and milestone payments 
the following table summarizes collaboration revenue included in our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented years ended december  collaboration revenue attributable to us xtandi sales attributable to ex us xtandi sales attributable to up front and milestone payments total collaboration revenues attributable to us xtandi sales under the astellas collaboration agreement  astellas records all us xtandi sales 
we and astellas share equally all pre tax profits and losses from us xtandi sales 
subject to certain exceptions  we and astellas also share equally all xtandi development and commercialization costs attributable to the us market  including cost of goods sold and the royalty on net sales payable to ucla under our xtandi license agreement 
the primary exceptions to cost sharing are that each party bears its own commercial full time equivalent  or fte costs  and that development costs supporting regulatory approvals in both the united states and either europe or japan are borne one third by us and two thirds by astellas 
both we and astellas are entitled to receive a fee for each qualifying detail made by our respective sales representatives 
we recognize collaboration revenue attributable to us xtandi sales in the period in which such sales occur 
collaboration revenue attributable to us xtandi sales consists of our share of pre tax profits and losses from us sales  plus reimbursement of our share of reimbursable us development and commercialization costs 
our collaboration revenue attributable to us xtandi sales in any given period will be mathematically equal to of us xtandi net sales as reported by astellas for the applicable period 
for the year ended december   collaboration revenue attributable to us xtandi sales totaled million 
as xtandi first became commercially available on september   there were no related revenues for the prior years 

table of contents collaboration revenue attributable to us xtandi sales for the year ended december  was calculated as follows year ended december  net us sales as reported by astellas shared us development and commercialization costs pre tax us profit loss medivation s share of pre tax us profit loss reimbursement of medivation s share of shared us costs collaboration revenue attributable to us xtandi sales under the astellas collaboration agreement  the deductions from gross sales used to derive net sales of xtandi are determined in a manner consistent with astellas internal accounting policies  consistently applied 
the largest component of the deductions used in deriving net sales is legally mandated discounts or rebates to medicare and other government payors 
because the indicated patient population for xtandi consists largely of men over the age of  we believe that a significant portion of these men will be medicare beneficiaries 
under the astellas collaboration agreement  the estimates used in calculating gross to net deductions will be reassessed periodically and trued up as appropriate in accordance with astellas internal accounting policies  as consistently applied 
collaboration revenues attributable to ex us xtandi sales under the astellas collaboration agreement  astellas records all ex us xtandi sales 
astellas is responsible for all development and commercialization costs for xtandi outside the us  including cost of goods sold and the royalty on net sales payable to ucla under our xtandi license agreement  and pays us a tiered royalty ranging from the low teens to the low twenties on net ex us xtandi sales 
we will recognize collaboration revenue attributable to ex us xtandi sales in the period in which such sales occur 
collaboration revenue attributable to ex us xtandi sales consists of royalties from astellas on those sales 
because xtandi has not yet been approved for sale outside of the us  there have been no collaboration revenues attributable to ex us xtandi sales to date 
collaboration revenues attributable to up front and milestone payments we record non refundable  up front payments under the astellas collaboration agreement and our former collaboration agreement with pfizer as deferred revenue and recognize these payments as collaboration revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable estimated performance period 
milestone payments earned by us under the astellas collaboration agreement are recognized as revenue in their entirety in the period in which the underlying milestone event is achieved  except that any milestone payments that a are related to the performance of our deliverables under the astellas collaboration agreement  b are triggered by events that occur during the performance period under the astellas collaboration agreement  and c do not constitute substantive milestones  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as collaboration revenue on a straight line basis over the expected performance period 

table of contents collaboration revenue attributable to up front and milestone payments for the years ended december   and was as follows years ended december  collaboration revenue attributable to up front and milestone payments from astellas from pfizer total collaboration revenue attributable to up front and milestone payments percentage change collaboration revenue attributable to up front and milestone payments from astellas for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or  as compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to the million of development milestone payments we earned under the astellas collaboration agreement in collaboration revenue attributable to up front and milestone payments from pfizer for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or  as compared to the prior year 
the increase resulted from the accelerated recognition of the remaining unamortized portion of the up front payment received under the former collaboration agreement with pfizer  due to the termination of the agreement in january amortization of the full pfizer up front payment was completed upon completion of our performance obligations in the third quarter of the decrease in collaboration revenue attributable to up front and milestone payments for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was due primarily to a change in estimate of the remaining performance period under our former collaboration agreement with pfizer 
the remaining unamortized up front and milestone payments recorded as deferred revenue at december  and december  consisted of the following december  current portion of deferred revenue from astellas from pfizer total long term portion of deferred revenue from astellas from pfizer total research and development expenses years ended december  research and development expenses percentage change r d expenses increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million 
table of contents increase in personnel costs resulting from higher staffing levels  a million increase in development milestone related payments to ucla  and a million increase in clinical and preclinical development costs 
r d expenses increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs resulting from higher staffing levels and bonus expense  a million increase in consulting and professional service expenses associated with increased workload on our affirm and prevail trials and a million increase in preclinical expenses associated with new programs 
these increases were partially offset by lower clinical expenses of million resulting primarily from reduced dimebon development activities 
r d expenses represented   and of total operating expenses for the years ended december    and  respectively 
r d headcount increased to full time employees at december  from full time employees at december  under both the astellas collaboration agreement and our former collaboration agreement with pfizer  we and our collaboration partners share certain development costs in the united states 
the parties make quarterly cost sharing payments to one another in amounts necessary to ensure that each party bears its contractual share of the shared us development costs incurred 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded development cost sharing payments from astellas and pfizer  and corresponding reductions in r d expenses  as follows years ended december  development cost sharing payments from astellas development cost sharing payments from pfizer total we have been engaged in two major research and development programs the development of xtandi for the treatment of prostate and breast cancer and the development of dimebon for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington disease 
other research and development programs consist of earlier stage programs 
research and development costs are identified as either directly allocable to one of our research and development programs or an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
direct costs consist primarily of clinical and preclinical study costs  cost of supplying drug substance and drug product for use in clinical and preclinical studies  milestone related payments to the licensor of our enzalutamide technology  personnel costs including both cash costs and non cash stock based compensation costs  contract research organization fees  and other contracted services pertaining to specific clinical and preclinical studies 
indirect costs consist of corporate overhead costs and other administrative and support costs 
the following table summarizes the direct costs attributable to each program and the total indirect costs for each respective period 
years ended december  direct costs xtandi enzalutamide other dimebon total direct costs indirect costs total we and pfizer discontinued development of dimebon for all indications in january  and completed the wind down of each of our respective remaining collaboration activities in the third quarter of 
table of contents our projects or intended projects may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we will need to establish to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authorities in the united states  europe and other relevant regions that the applicable product candidate is both safe and effective for each of its intended indications 
the process of conducting the preclinical and clinical testing required to establish safety and efficacy and obtain regulatory approvals is expensive  uncertain and takes many years 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the time or cost required in obtaining such regulatory approvals  and failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected  for either some or all of the indications for which they are being developed 
the length of time required for clinical development of a particular product candidate and our development costs for that product candidate may be impacted by the scope and timing of enrollment in clinical trials for the product candidate  unanticipated additional clinical trials that may be required  future decisions to develop a product candidate for subsequent indications  and whether in the future we decide to pursue development of the product candidate with a corporate partner or independently 
for example  xtandi may have the potential to be approved for multiple indications  and we do not yet know how many of those indications we and our partner  astellas  will pursue 
the decision to pursue regulatory approval for subsequent indications will depend on several variables outside of our control  including the strength of the data generated in our prior and ongoing clinical and non clinical studies and both our and our partners willingness to jointly fund such additional work 
furthermore  the scope and number of clinical studies required to obtain regulatory approval for each pursued indication is subject to the input of the applicable regulatory authorities  we have not yet sought such input for all potential indications that we and our collaboration partner may elect to pursue  and even after having given such input applicable regulatory authorities may subsequently require additional clinical studies prior to granting regulatory approval based on new data generated by us or other companies  or for other reasons outside of our control 
moreover  we or our current or potential future collaboration partners may decide to discontinue development of any development project at any time for regulatory  commercial  scientific or other reasons

selling  general and administrative expenses years ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses percentage change sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs resulting from higher staffing levels to support the us commercial launch of xtandi for post chemotherapy mcrpc patients  a million increase in third party sales and marketing expenses to support the us commercial launch of xtandi  a million increase in legal fees relating primarily to our pending litigation against ucla  one of its professors and aragon  a million increase in facilities related expenses for our new corporate and commercial headquarters and million of royalty expense to ucla on net sales of xtandi 
sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs resulting from higher staffing levels and bonus expense  and a million increase in 
table of contents legal fees primarily related to our pending litigation against ucla  one of its professors and aragon and the defense of the securities class action lawsuit initiated in response to the negative results of our connection trial 
the increase in sg a expenses was further impacted by a million increase in sales and marketing expenses as a result of increased market research and public relations expense due to the positive results of our phase affirm trial  and a million increase in recruitment expenses as a result of increased headcount in sg a expenses represented   and of total operating expenses for the years ended december    and  respectively 
sg a headcount increased to full time employees at december  from full time employees at december  under both the astellas collaboration agreement and the former collaboration agreement with pfizer  we and our collaboration partners share certain commercialization costs in the united states 
the parties make quarterly cost sharing payments to one another in amounts necessary to ensure that each party bears its contractual share of the shared us commercialization costs incurred

the impact of foreign exchange rates on our results of operations fluctuates from period to period based upon our foreign currency exposures resulting from changes in applicable foreign exchange rates associated with our foreign currency denominated payables and was not significant during the period presented 
income tax expense benefit years ended december  income tax expense benefit effective income tax rate 
table of contents income tax expense for the year ended december  was not significant  due to our net loss for the year 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million 
the income tax benefit was due primarily to the ability to carry back our net loss to the prior two tax years 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  which represents an effective income tax rate of 
we incurred income tax liability for despite reporting a net loss in our consolidated financial statements primarily because we recognized for tax purposes in substantially all of the million up front payment and all of the million development milestone payment previously received from astellas 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and access to capital we have incurred cumulative net losses of million since inception through december   and expect to incur substantial additional losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to finance the commercialization of xtandi in the us market  clinical and preclinical studies of xtandi and early stage technologies  and our corporate overhead costs 
our operating losses have had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our working capital  total assets  and stockholders equity 
we and our collaboration partner astellas commenced commercial sales of xtandi in the us for the treatment of post chemotherapy mcrpc patients on september  sales and profit potential is unproven 
we did not generate any collaboration revenue attributable to us xtandi sales until the third quarter of we do not know when  or if  xtandi will begin to generate profits in the us market  will be approved for sale in the us market for any indication other than treatment of post chemotherapy mcrpc patients  or will be approved for sale in any other market for any indication 
we may never achieve profitability and even if we do  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have funded our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock  the issuance of the convertible notes  and from the up front  development milestone and cost sharing payments under the astellas collaboration agreement and our former collaboration agreement with pfizer 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million 
our cash and investment policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we invest our cash equivalents in highly liquid money market accounts and our short term investments in highly liquid us treasury securities 
based on our current expectations  we believe our capital resources at december  combined with our anticipated future cash flows will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations for at least the next months 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong  including assumptions regarding net sales of xtandi in the us market  potential xtandi approvals in other markets and for other indications and potential receipt of profit sharing  royalty and milestone payments under our astellas collaboration agreement  and we could exhaust our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments earlier than presently anticipated 
for example  we may be required or choose to seek additional capital to fund the costs of commercialization of xtandi in the us  to expand our preclinical and clinical development activities for xtandi and other existing or potential future product candidates  if we face challenges or delays in connection with our clinical trials  to maintain minimum cash balances that we deem reasonable and prudent  or in the event a fundamental change occurs under the terms of the convertible notes  which would give the holders of the convertible notes the right to require us to purchase their convertible notes in cash 
in addition  we intend to evaluate the capital markets from time to time to determine whether to raise additional capital in the form of equity  convertible debt or otherwise  depending on market conditions relative to our need for funds at such time  and we may seek to raise additional capital at any time should we conclude that such capital is available on terms that we consider to be in the best interests of our company and our stockholders 

table of contents our current view of the worldwide capital markets is that they are extremely volatile with limited accessibility  and many biotechnology companies have had limited or no success in obtaining funding in this environment 
continuation of this challenging market climate may significantly limit our ability to raise funds  and there can be no assurance we will be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing would be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants and increase our interest expense  leverage and operating and financial costs 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results
