table of contents overview bemis company  inc is a leading global manufacturer of packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets 
historically  about percent of our total net sales are to customers in the food industry 
sales of our packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store 
our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry has typically provided a more stable market environment for our us packaging and global packaging business segments  which accounted for approximately percent of our net sales in our remaining net sales are from our pressure sensitive materials business segment which  while diversified in end use products  is more exposed to economically sensitive end markets 
market conditions the markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive 
our leading market positions in packaging for perishable food and medical device products reflect our focus on value added  proprietary products that provide food safety and sterility benefits 
we also manufacture products for which our technical know how and economies of scale offer us a competitive advantage 
the primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins and films  paper  inks  adhesives  aluminum and chemicals 
over the past several years  global economic conditions have been weak and prices of food products have increased 
while economic growth in latin america and asia has exceeded that of north america and europe  the pace of growth in these regions has slowed over the past months 
as a result  we have generally experienced a slowdown in demand in the various geographic regions in which we operate 
in addition  foreign currency exchange rates weakened against the us dollar during  reducing operating results reported from our foreign operations as they are translated to us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
facility consolidation to improve efficiencies and reduce fixed costs  we initiated a facility consolidation program during the fourth quarter of and expanded the program in the second quarter of in total nine production facilities will be closed and most of the production from these facilities has been transferred to other facilities 
as of december   manufacturing operations had ceased at seven of these manufacturing facilities and the remaining closures are expected to be completed in early the most current estimate of the total cost of the programs is million which includes approximately million in employee related costs  approximately million in fixed asset accelerated depreciation and write downs  and approximately million in other facility consolidation costs 
we recorded million and million of charges associated with the facility consolidation programs during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
these costs have been recorded on the consolidated statement of income as facility consolidation and other costs 
we expect the remaining approximately million of estimated costs to be expensed during cash payments for these programs in and totaled million and million  respectively 
cash payments in are expected to be approximately million 
acquisitions australia and new zealand distributors on august   we acquired two flexible packaging businesses in australia and new zealand 
the acquisition of these businesses supports our strategy to enhance our presence in the asia pacific region

under the terms of the billion transaction  we acquired food americas flexible packaging facilities in the united states  canada  mexico  brazil  argentina  and new zealand 
these facilities are included in our us and global packaging business segments and produce flexible packaging principally for the food and beverage industries and augment our product offerings and technological capabilities 
sale of discontinued operations under the terms of an order signed by the us district court for the district of columbia on february   a portion of the alcan packaging food americas business acquired on march  was to be divested  accordingly  we had classified the related operating results as discontinued operations 
on july   we sold these discontinued operations to exopack holding corp  an affiliate of private investment firm sun capital partners  inc the transaction was completed for a cash purchase price  net of selling costs  of million 
the divested business recorded net sales of approximately million and included two facilities that manufacture flexible packaging for retail natural cheese and shrink bags for fresh red meat

results for included a charge associated with facility consolidation and other costs and of charges for acquisition related earnout and transaction payments  partially offset by a gain associated with a non us pension plan curtailment 
versus net sales for the year ended december  increased by percent 
we estimate that acquisitions increased net sales by approximately percent during the year 
currency translation increased net sales by percent

this compared to diluted earnings per share for of  which included a charge related to our alcan packaging food americas acquisition and a charge related to the pre closing impact of the july financing of the alcan packaging food americas acquisition 
diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were in operating results for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and lower unit sales volumes during the year 
new reportable business segments on january   we announced the realignment of our segment reporting 
as a result  we now report business segment information for three reportable segments as follows us packaging  global packaging  and pressure sensitive materials 
the expansion from two to three reportable segments reflects the separation of the flexible packaging business segment into us packaging and global packaging business segments 
the pressure sensitive materials business segment remains unchanged 
we transitioned to these segments in  which reflects the separation of flexible packaging into the us packaging and global packaging segments 
all information in this annual report on form k has been recast to conform to this new segment reporting structure 
in connection with the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system during  we recorded adjustments primarily to cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter in order to harmonize the application of certain accounting practices and provide consistency among the business segments 
these adjustments made to individual locations across the segments substantially offset one another

research and development r d dollars in millions research and development r d r d as a percentage of net sales for the year  r d expense increased modestly over and as a percentage of net sales 
our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations 
our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment  bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment 
we believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency  effectiveness  and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products 
expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold 
other operating income expense  net dollars in millions other operating income expense  net for the year  other operating income and expense included million of fiscal incentive income compared to million in and million in the reduction in fiscal incentives reflects the impact of currency translation and includes a general reduction in fiscal incentives which is expected to continue going forward

table of contents interest expense dollars in millions interest expense effective interest rate the effective interest rate decreased in compared to primarily due to refinancing public notes totaling million with lower cost commercial paper on april  interest expense increased in compared to as a result of the october issuance of million long term notes 
these funds were raised in anticipation of the repayment of the million notes which matured on april  other non operating income expense  net dollars in millions other non operating income expense  net during  the increase in net other non operating income expense reflects increased interest income 
during  net other non operating income expense included interest income and a gain on sales of excess land  partially offset by a foreign exchange loss of million 
income taxes dollars in millions income taxes effective tax rate our effective income tax rate was percent 
this higher rate was caused by adjustments to valuation allowances based on the likely realization of the future benefits related to specific net deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets relate primarily to accumulated operating losses incurred by certain legal entities in foreign countries 
excluding these adjustments  the effective tax rate for would have been percent 
the difference between our overall tax rate and the us statutory rate of percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes  net of federal income tax benefits  and the differences between tax rates in the various foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests primarily represented the outstanding preferred shares of dixie toga ltda  our brazilian flexible packaging subsidiary 
during the third quarter of  we completed the purchase of the outstanding shares owned by the noncontrolling interest of dixie toga for approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources debt to total capitalization net debt to total capitalization which includes total debt net of cash balances divided by total debt net of cash balances plus equity was percent at december   compared to percent at december  total debt as of december  and was billion and billion  respectively 
credit rating our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating agencies 
during  one credit rating agency revised their credit rating and the other credit rating agency adjusted their credit rating outlook 
the downward adjustments have not impacted our investment grade status or our ability to access the capital markets  including the commercial paper markets  at favorable rates of interest 
cash flow net cash provided by operations totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in increasing raw material costs negatively impacted working capital levels during and net cash provided by operations was reduced by contributions to our defined benefit pension plans of million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are expected to be approximately million in 
table of contents net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  this compares to cash used in investing activities in totaling million  reflecting the acquisitions of mayor packaging and shield pack  and cash used in investing activities in totaling billion  reflecting the acquisition of alcan packaging food americas 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  included repayment of our million notes 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  included the purchase of million shares of our common stock for million  and the purchase of the remaining shares of our brazilian subsidiary  dixie toga  ltda 
owned by the noncontrolling interest for million 
this compares to cash used for financing activities during the year ended december  that included the purchase of million shares of our common stock for million  and the purchase of subsidiary shares from noncontrolling interests of million 
available financing in addition to using cash provided by operations  we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs 
at year end  our commercial paper debt outstanding was million 
based on our current credit rating  we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets 
under the terms of our revolving credit agreement  we have the capacity to borrow up to million 
this facility is principally used as back up for our commercial paper program 
our revolving credit facility is supported by a group of major us and international banks 
covenants imposed by the revolving credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses  minimum net worth calculations  and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization 
the revolving credit agreement includes a million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries 
at december   there was no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility 
if this revolving credit facility was no longer available to us and we were not able to issue commercial paper  we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market  which would increase our borrowing costs 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to a variable interest rate 
liquidity outlook on july   we amended our revolving credit facility to increase the total amount available from million to million and to extend the term from april  to july  as of december   million of outstanding debt was supported by this credit facility  leaving million of available credit 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents outside of the united states was million 
we use a notional pooling arrangement with an international bank to help manage global liquidity requirements 
under this pooling arrangement  our participating subsidiaries maintain either a cash deposit or borrowing position through local currency accounts with the bank  so long as the aggregate position of the global pool is a notionally calculated net cash deposit 
this notional pooling arrangement allows reasonable access to the our cash in foreign subsidiaries  as well as provides a financing option to foreign subsidiaries beyond our multi currency credit facility 
management expects cash flow from operations and available liquidity described above to be sufficient to support operations going forward 
there can be no assurance  however  that the cost or availability of future borrowings will not be impacted by future capital market disruptions 
in addition  increases in raw material costs would increase our short term liquidity needs 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million during  compared to million in  and million in we expect to fund capital expenditures with cash provided by operating activities 
dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend by percent during the first quarter of to per share from per share 
this follows increases of percent in and percent in in february  the board of directors approved the th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to per share  a percent increase 
share repurchases during  we purchased million shares of our common stock in the open market  compared to million shares in no shares were repurchased during as of december   we were authorized to purchase an additional million shares of our common stock for the treasury 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations  operating lease obligations  and certain other purchase obligations as of december  obligations under capital leases are insignificant 
contractual payments due by period less than to to more than in millions total year years years years long term debt obligations interest expense operating leases purchase obligations postretirement obligations severance total these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on july  certain amounts have been reflected as being due in less than one year even though they have been classified as long term in our consolidated balance sheet 
commercial paper has been included in long term debt in our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with our ability and intent to refinance these items on a long term basis 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our long term debt 
a portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates 
the amounts disclosed above assume that future variable interest rates are equal to rates at december  we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials  utilities  capital equipment and various other goods and services 
postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded bemis supplemental retirement plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our postretirement benefit obligations 
severance costs relate to our facility consolidation program  which is further described in note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we also have long term obligations related to our income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions  environmental liabilities and multi employer and pension defined benefit plans 
these liabilities have been excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments 
see consolidated financial statements and related notes 
market risks and foreign currency exposures we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative trading purposes 
our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control  counterparty risk  and ongoing reporting 
these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates 
a portion of the interest expense on our outstanding debt is subject to short term interest rates 
as such  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
for each one percent increase in variable interest rates  the annual interest expense on million of variable rate debt outstanding which includes million fixed rate 
table of contents notes that have been effectively converted to variable rate debt through the use of a fixed to variable rate interest rate swap would increase by approximately million 
we enter into interest rate swap contracts to economically convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million 
these contracts were designated as hedges of our million percent fixed rate debt due in the variable rate for each of the interest rate swaps is based on the six month london interbank offered rate libor  set in arrears  plus a fixed spread 
the variable rates are reset semi annually at each net settlement date 
the net settlement benefit to us  which is recorded as a reduction in interest expense  was million and million in and  respectively 
at december  and  the fair value of these interest rate swaps was million and million  respectively  in our favor  using discounted cash flow or other appropriate methodologies  and is included in deferred charges and other assets with a corresponding increase in long term debt 
our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months 
counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
we have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
the net settlement amount fair value related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contracts is recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other operating income expense  net  which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability 
amounts recognized in income related to forward exchange contracts were million of income and million of income in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our business in brazil held us dollar denominated debt which created exposure to changes in currency rates when compared to its functional currency of the brazilian real 
in order to hedge this exposure  we entered into currency swap contracts with maturities that matched the underlying debt  effectively converting a portion of the us denominated debt to the local currency 
we had not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
there were no outstanding currency swap contracts as of december  or december  the net settlement amount fair value related to swap contracts was recorded on the balance sheet as either a current or long term asset or liability and as an expense element of other non operating income expense  net  which offset the related transaction gains or losses 
amounts recognized related to these currency swaps were million of expense in the year ended december  critical accounting estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to retirement benefits  intangible assets  goodwill  and expected future performance of operations 
our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities  and the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill 
pension costs amounts related to our defined benefit pension plans that are recognized in our financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
the accounting for our pension plans requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet 
a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states 
net periodic pension cost recorded in was million  compared to pension cost of million in and million in 
table of contents one element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rules is the expected return on plan assets 
for the year  we maintained a target allocation to equity investments of percent of total assets and an expected long term rate of return on total us pension plan assets of percent 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based on our target asset allocation 
for the historical long term investment periods of   and years ending december   our us pension plan assets earned annualized rates of return of percent  percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
using our us target asset allocation of plan assets of percent equity securities and percent fixed income securities  our outside actuaries have used their independent economic models to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and  based on their results  we have determined our us asset return assumptions to be reasonable 
this assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years 
this process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods 
the net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income and expense 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities 
this discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to changes in rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   for our us defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of one quarter of one percent from the percent rate used at december  for our non us pension plans  we follow similar methodologies in determining the appropriate expected rates of return on assets and discount rates to be used in our actuarial calculations in each individual country 
us pension assumptions sensitivity analysis based on our current discount rate assumption of percent and our expected rate of return on pension plan assets of percent  we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for to be in a range of million to million 
the following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets 
discount rate total increase decrease to pension expense from current assumption in millions rate of return on plan assets total increase decrease to pension expense from current assumption in millions percent percent percent percent percent percent percent percent percent current assumption percent current assumption percent percent percent percent percent percent percent percent the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset  in the case of an overfunded plan  or as a liability  in the case of an underfunded plan 
the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
the following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate 

table of contents total increase decrease in accumulated other comprehensive discount rate income  net of taxes  from current assumptions in millions percent percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent percent intangible assets and goodwill the purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  liabilities assumed  and goodwill 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including intangible assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was billion as of december  intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology  customer relationships  patents  trademarks  and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to years  when purchased 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events  condition  and amounts of future cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements there has been no new accounting guidance issued or effective during that is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item a is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  and under the caption market risks and foreign currency exposures which is part of management s discussion and analysis included in item of this annual report on form k 
based on a sensitivity analysis assuming a percent adverse change in market rates of our foreign exchange  currency swaps  and interest rate derivatives and other financial instruments  changes in exchange rates or interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position and liquidity 
the effect on our consolidated results of operations would be substantially offset by the impact of the hedged items
