this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this report 
overview as discussed in greater detail in item business  we currently engage in the following service lines portamedic performs paramedical and medical examinations of individuals  primarily on behalf of insurance companies in connection with the offering or rating of insurance coverage mainly life insurance  along with medical examinations of health plan participants in order to provide medical information on plan members to the plan sponsors  heritage labs performs tests of blood  urine and oral fluid specimens  primarily generated in connection with the paramedical exams and wellness screenings performed by our portamedic and health wellness service lines  respectively  and assembles and sells specimen collection kits  health wellness performs risk assessment and risk management services  including biometric screenings  health risk assessments and onsite wellness coaching for health and care management companies  including wellness companies  disease management organizations  clinical research organizations  health plans and others  and hooper holmes services provides telephone interviews of insurance candidates  retrieval of medical records and inspections  risk management solutions and underwriting services for simplified issue products and products requiring full underwriting 
our core portamedic paramedical examination service line accounted for approximately  and of our total consolidated revenues in  and  respectively 
as a provider of health risk assessment services to the insurance industry  our business is subject to seasonality  with third quarter sales typically dropping below the other quarters due to the decline in activity typically experienced by the insurance industry during the summer months 
highlights and business outlook for consolidated financial performance for for the year ended december   consolidated revenues totaled million  representing a decline of approximately from the prior year 
our gross margin declined approximately basis points to primarily due to the year over year revenue decline in our portamedic service line 
our selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in representing a decrease of million  or  from the prior year 
we reported a loss from continuing operations of million for the year ended december   which included restructuring and impairment charges of approximately million 
restructure of portamedic operations in january  we began a business transformation of our portamedic service line 
the first phase of the transformation consisted of our investment of approximately million in new systems and technology that served as the foundation for the second phase of portamedic transformation  a new model for delivering paramedical exams 
these new systems  now deployed  include i a new workflow system for our portamedic operations  known as partnerlink  ii eportamedic 
com  a new ordering and status website for insurance agents that diagnoses service requirements based on insurance company rules  iii a new life application processing platform that makes it easier for financial advisors and brokers to sell life insurance  iv the latest version of our iparamed e exam  which allows electronic exams to be completed even in areas with poor wireless connections  and v a new direct to examiner inventory and tracking system for laboratory testing kits 
in june  we began the second phase of our portamedic service line transformation  which included the deployment of our new model for delivering paramedical exam services 
the service model is a new optimized approach for ordering  scheduling and delivering paramedical exams in the applicant home or office any time  anywhere in the us over local administrative offices have been consolidated into integrated customer service centers located across company defined regions 
these service centers are designed to take advantage of our existing call center capabilities and it investments to enable us to provide better levels of service  which we expect will lead to improved sales of portamedic exams 
in addition  the new model for delivering exam services has enabled us to reduce our facilities footprint and reduce labor costs previously associated with performing certain administrative and management tasks in each of our over offices 
we expect that  on an annual basis  the changes we have implemented have reduced the company cost structure by approximately million beginning in the third quarter of  primarily attributable to a reduction in the number of local branch offices and the related lease expense  headcount reductions resulting from centralizing administrative functions such as imaging and billing  and reduced operating expenses  including lower shipping expenses resulting from our new direct to examiner inventory system 
for the three years ended december   and  the company consolidated revenues totaled million  million and million  respectively  representing declines of and and  respectively  from the prior year periods which were primarily attributable to the portamedic service line 
the number of examinations completed by portamedic in was negatively impacted by a continuing weak economy  loss of market share and a reduction in life insurance applications requiring a paramedical exam  which we have continued to experience over the past few years 
the number of examinations completed by portamedic in was also negatively impacted by implementation issues regarding our new it system for processing portamedic customer orders  along with the june deployment of our new portamedic service delivery model and the related transitional operational issues associated with the implementation of this new model 
the implementation of our new it system for processing portamedic customer orders was completed in the second quarter of  and the implementation issues were resolved during the third quarter of although the new portamedic delivery model resulted in a lower cost structure branch office closures and centralized services  given the complexity of the new delivery model  we are continuing to address certain sales and operational issues related to the new model in an effort to improve future sales 
further optimization of our delivery model is expected in if the new portamedic delivery model is not successful and revenues continue to decline  operating losses will continue  further asset impairments may occur and the company will be required to take additional actions to further reduce or delay expenses and uses of cash 
this would also reduce our cash reserves and would require us to borrow against our new loan and security agreement 
there is no guarantee that the portamedic delivery model will reverse the decline in revenues or that our cost reduction actions will generate the savings necessary to offset revenue declines  operating losses and uses of cash 
in connection with our portamedic business transformation and deployment of the new service delivery model in june  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million for the year ended december  these restructuring charges consisted of employee severance totaling million and branch office closure costs totaling million 
in the fourth quarter of and continuing in  portamedic revenue declines continued at higher rates compared to pre june revenue declines  thus triggering us to perform an impairment evaluation of the long lived assets primarily associated with the portamedic new model for delivering paramedical exam services 
the evaluation resulted in an impairment charge associated with the above described new systems and technology totaling million  in addition to million related to the impairment of fixed assets for the closed branch offices and million related to the impairment of hooper holmes services long lived assets 
at december   million of restructuring charges are recorded in accrued expenses in the company consolidated balance sheet 
cash payments related to the above described restructuring charges are expected to be completed within the next twelve months  except for certain long term branch office closure costs of million  which are recorded in other long term liabilities as of december  these changes comprise a large scale operational transformation designed to give hooper holmes the competitive advantages of faster and more accurate service delivery and lower operating costs 
we believe that this restructuring and capital investment is necessary to meet the needs of customers in the paramed industry for consistent service  accurate scheduling  and timely completion of exams 
loan and security agreement as of december   we maintained a loan and security agreement the loan and security agreement with td bank  which was scheduled to to expire on march  on february   in conjunction with entering into a new three year loan and security agreement the loan and security agreement with keltic financial partners ii  lp keltic financial  we terminated the loan and security agreement with td bank 
the loan and security agreement provides us with a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding which does not exceed of eligible receivables as defined in the loan and security agreement  provided that in no event can the aggregate amount of the revolving credit loans at any time exceed million 
we may also request a revolving credit limit increase  not to exceed million  subject to certain terms and conditions and at the sole discretion of keltic financial 
on march   we entered into the first amendment to the loan and security agreement with keltic financial 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
portamedic for the year ended december   portamedic revenues totaled million  a decrease of in comparison to the prior year 
we continue to believe that achieving acceptable profitability levels will require top line revenue growth and reversing past revenue declines 
although we have contracts or billing approvals with over of the insurance carriers in the marketplace  the number of paramedical examinations we complete on life insurance applicants continued to decline 
the rate of decline in completed examinations for was compared to  with a decline in compared to as noted previously  the number of examinations completed by portamedic in was negatively impacted by a continuing weak economy  loss of market share and a reduction in life insurance applications requiring a paramedical exam  which we have continued to experience over the past few years 
the number of examinations completed by portamedic in was also negatively impacted by implementation issues regarding our new it system for processing portamedic customer orders  along with the june deployment of our new portamedic service delivery model and the related transitional operational issues associated with the implementation of this new model 
in order to reverse our decline in completed examinations  we are taking the following steps to achieve greater sales success with local agents  brokers  direct marketers and insurance carriers we deployed our new portamedic service delivery model 
the introduction of this new program is expected to enable us to expand and improve our current service delivery model and provide greater operational performance and service quality  while reducing operating costs in our current branch office structure 
we added a new vice president of portamedic provider relations 
this position will be dedicated to building our network of health professionals for both our portamedic service line  and our health and wellness service line

we replaced over local administrative offices with integrated customer service centers strategically located across the regions 
administrative functions such as imaging and billing have been centralized 
in addition  every job in our portamedic service line from senior management to customer service representative has a new position description tied to quality measures that we believe directly align with customer expectations 
we established a team of health professional managers to recruit  educate and mentor our national health professional network 
we entered into an agreement to become rsa medical exclusive  national provider of paramedical exams outside of rsa medical home state of illinois 
rsa medical is a leading provider of medical assessment and medical management for patients interacting with the life and health insurance companies 
the agreement gives hooper holmes access outside of illinois to rsa medical nationwide examiner network  medlink  to augment hooper holmes own network of local health professionals nationwide 
as part of the agreement  and to support rsa medical exam business in illinois  hooper holmes will provide laboratory testing kits to rsa medical and will perform billing services to life insurance companies at the request of rsa medical when it is appropriate

we completed a consultative service study with another of our larger customers which resulted in new vendor management services provided by portamedic which includes overseeing all of this customers paramedical service vendors 
we integrated our on line scheduling tool into the call center operations of another of our larger customers  as well as the operations of a new customer 
we entered into an agreement with a national insurance brokerage firm to provide efficient data acquisition and processing solutions 
using the full breadth of our service capabilities  we expect to improve this brokerage insurance e application process 
we promoted and hired new field sales managers during we introduced new field sales and regional operations incentive compensation plans and performance measurement systems  while implementing a new customer relationship management system for our sales teams 
we launched a new portamedic web portal to make it easier for customers to order our services 
we implemented a new warehouse management and inventory control system to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in distributing lab kits to our health professionals 
we expanded our iparamed e exam platform  deploying over  iparamed equipped netbooks to health professionals in all states and the district of columbia 
we are working with potential new customers to better understand their business needs in order to adapt our iparamed e exam platform for use by these life insurance carriers 
in  our goal is to provide this service to five additional life insurance carriers 
we continue to promote the integrated services provided by hooper holmes 
we have reached an agreement for these integrated services with a new larger customer that we expect will generate revenue between million and million in we completed the rollout of our new it system for processing portamedic customer orders known as partnerlink  which is expected to improve customer service  while lowering future operating costs 
we installed our portamedic ordering platform into two large call centers operated by the direct sales organization of one of our larger life insurance carrier customers 
we believe that the steps we have taken to improve our selling ability  and the quality and speed of our services  will enable us to reduce the rate of decline in revenue experienced in the last several years 
however  there is no guarantee that the portamedic delivery model  or these other initiatives  will reverse the decline in revenues or that our cost reduction actions will generate the savings necessary to offset revenue declines  operating losses and uses of cash 
heritage labs for the year ended december   heritage labs revenues totaled million  a decrease of in comparison to the prior year 
revenue from lab testing declined compared to  and revenues from lab kit assembly declined in compared to heritage labs services consist principally of performing tests of blood  urine and oral fluid specimens and the assembly and sale of kits used in the collection and transportation of such specimens to its lab facility 
in  approximately of heritage labs revenue came from lab testing and came from the sale of assembled lab specimen kits 
in and  approximately of heritage labs revenue came from lab testing and came from the sale of assembled lab specimen kits 
although heritage labs lost several customers in which will reduce revenue  heritage labs has taken the following steps to reverse these declines and identify new customers heritage labs continues to focus on data modeling to gain a better understanding of the true mortality consequences of the laboratory tests that we provide to the insurance industry 
our objective is to assist our clients in their ability to develop new insurance products and establish more accurate premium rating or pricing techniques using the lab mortality data that we have developed 
we have developed risk scores to help our insurance clients better understand the mortality implications between and among interactions of multiple tests related to specific disease states 
we believe that the mortality data we are providing are unique and more complex than the data being provided by our competitors 
we believe we will be able to leverage the value of the data we supply to gain new business 
we have developed sales initiatives designed to increase the number of paramedical examinations completed by our portamedic service line that generate lab testing orders for heritage labs 
we have also developed sales initiatives designed to increase the volume of lab test orders for heritage labs that are not generated by portamedic exams 
health wellness our health wellness service line recorded revenues of approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or approximately  from the prior year 
in  we performed approximately  health screenings  compared to approximately  screenings in we have conducted screening events in every state in the us as well as the district of columbia and puerto rico 
currently  we have certified approximately  of the examiners in our network to be wellness certified examiners 
health wellness services include event scheduling  provision and fulfillment of all supplies eg  examination kits  blood pressure cuffs  stadiometers  scales  centrifuges  lab coats  bandages  etc 
at screening events  event management  biometric screenings height  weight  body mass index  hip  waist  neck  pulse  blood pressure  blood draws via venipuncture or finger stick  lab testing  participant and aggregate reporting  data processing and data transmission 
heritage labs does all of the testing on the venipuncture samples we collect at health and wellness screenings 
we believe the market for health and wellness is likely to grow over the next three to five years  and that we are well positioned to increase revenues from our biometric screening and other related services 
key highlights for include we completed technology integration  staffing and training  and developed new standard operating procedures required to serve westat  inc in support of the largest government study of tobacco use ever conducted in the united states  a landmark collaboration between the national institute of health and the us food and drug administration

we expanded our new business sales team  increasing our pipeline of new business opportunities to support growth in we added a new service for screening remote individuals or small groups by accessing physician records 
we believe that we are well positioned to capture a significant share of the health and care management market given our company s unique set of assets  including heritage labs  our proprietary health wellness it system  and our network of certified health professionals 
however  the success of health wellness will also depend in part upon the success of our sponsors and their health and care management initiatives to the employers

the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenues is due to portamedic revenues declining at a rate greater than its associated costs  as a significant percentage of costs in this service line are fixed and therefore did not decrease as revenues declined 
the new portamedic service delivery model deployed during the second quarter of lowered the portamedic cost of operations  while improving customer service  but these costs savings were offset by our inability to reduce costs at a rate greater than the revenue declines we experienced 
in addition  our increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue is attributable to an increase in our lower margin services provided by portamedic 
portamedic costs of operations was also impacted by the investments we made in this service line during and  largely our investment in the deployment and operating costs related to our new workflow system known as partnerlink  our new ordering and status website and an updated version of our iparamed e exam

impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recovery of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of an asset many not be recoverable 
in june  our portamedic service line deployed its new model for delivering paramedical exam services 
this new model utilizes the following internal use software and website development costs i partnerlink  a new workflow system for portamedic operations  ii eportamedic 
com  a new web based ordering system  and iii iparamed e exam platform  whereby our health professionals utilize an iparamed equipped netbook to complete exams 
when deployed in june  the new portamedic delivery model was expected to reduce costs and improve service leading to an improvement in past revenue declines 
in the third quarter of  although the expected cost reductions were achieved  portamedic revenue declined at a higher year over year rate compared to the first half of revenue declines 
given the complexity of the new delivery model branch office closures  centralization of services  we believed it was too soon to assess the longer term impact on revenues 
however in the fourth quarter of and continuing in  portamedic revenue declines continued at higher rates compared to pre june revenue declines  thus triggering us to perform an impairment evaluation of the above described long lived assets 
additionally  we performed an impairment evaluation of the long lived assets of our hooper holmes services service line  specifically within this service line  the aps and tele underwriting assets 
the evaluation resulted in the determination that the carrying values of the above described long lived assets exceeded their projected undiscounted net cash flows 
with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we calculated the fair values of these long lived assets 
the fair values were determined based on discounted cash flows and indicated that an impairment existed for each of these long lived assets 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million which is included in impairment of long lived assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in connection with the restructure of portamedic operations  we recorded charges totaling million related to the impairment of fixed assets for branch offices closed primarily during the third quarter of these charges are included in impairment of long lived assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  restructuring charges for the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million 
these charges were primarily associated with the deployment of our new portamedic service delivery model in june  as discussed in the above section restructure of portamedic operations 
as we continue to optimize our new delivery model in  we may incur additional impairment and restructuring charges 
for the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million 
these charges consisted primarily of severance and branch office closure costs 
for the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of million 
these charges are attributable to severance related to the resignation of our former ceo and employee severance costs related to headcount reduction actions in portamedic and hooper holmes services 
operating loss income from continuing operations our consolidated operating loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
this decline is primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of million million in vs 
million in 
the decrease in our gross profit is primarily due to a decline in revenues of 
we also recorded a million charge related to the impairment of certain long lived assets and recorded restructuring charges of million  compared to impairment charges and restructuring charges in of million and million  respectively 
our consolidated operating loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to operating income of million in the prior year 
this decline is primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of million million in vs

other expense income interest income for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
other expense income  net for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
other expense income  net  for the year ended december  is comprised primarily of million in costs related to bank credit facility fees 
included in the results from continuing operations for the year ended december   in other expense income  net  is the reversal of million primarily related to previously accrued interest and penalties resulting from entering into voluntary compliance agreements with states relating to unclaimed property offset by million of amortization expense of costs associated with our credit facility 
included in the results for the year ended december  is a gain of approximately million representing the reversal of a reserve previously established for interest and penalties associated with a state unclaimed property matter for which the audit period had lapsed 
income taxes we have significant deferred tax assets attributable to tax deductible intangibles  and federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  which may reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on the continued decline in revenues  the cumulative tax and operating losses  the lack of taxes in the carryback period and the uncertainty surrounding the extent or timing of future taxable income  we do not believe we will realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we continue to record a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the income tax expense recorded in the year ended december  totaling million  reflects a state tax liability 
the income tax expense recorded in the year ended december  totaling million  is primarily due to taxes on gross revenues related to two states  a liability for amended tax returns including interest  for one of these states for the years through and the true up of the tax provision for two states 
the income tax expense recorded in the year ended december  is primarily due to a liability for amended tax returns filed in one state for tax years and  and the true up of the tax provision for this state 
as of december  and  no amounts were recorded for unrecognized tax benefits or for the payment of interest or penalties 
furthermore  no such amounts were accrued during the years ended december  and in july  we received notification from the us internal revenue service the irs that it had completed its audits of our tax returns for the years through with no adjustments 
in february  we were notified by the irs that they will examine our tax return for the year the exam has not yet begun 
state income tax returns for the year and forward are subject to examination 
as of december   we had us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively

we may also request a revolving credit limit increase  not to exceed million  subject to certain terms and conditions and at the sole discretion of keltic financial 
interest on revolving credit loans will be calculated based on the greatest of i the annualized prime rate plus  ii the day libor rate plus  and iii per annum 
in connection with the loan and security agreement  we incurred a commitment fee of million and other issue costs totaling million

the aforementioned security interest is collectively referred to herein as the collateral 
pursuant to the terms of the loan and security agreement  keltic financial  at its sole discretion  may establish reserves with respect to a any event which in keltic financial reasonable determination  diminishes the value of any collateral or b any of our contingent liabilities 
a reserve may reduce the aggregate amount of indebtedness that may be incurred under the loan and security agreement

our failure or the failure of any of our subsidiary guarantors to comply with any of the covenants or the breach of any of our representations and warranties  contained in the loan and security agreement  constitutes an event of default under the agreement 
restructure of portamedic operations in june  we restructured our portamedic service line  which included the deployment of a new model for delivering paramedical exam services 
the restructure resulted in  among other things  the closure of branch offices  headcount reductions  the elimination of both fixed and variable costs and the consolidation of certain services into centralized customer service centers 
for the year ended december   our consolidated revenues totaled million  representing a decline of from the prior year period which was primarily attributable to the portamedic service line 
we are monitoring the impact of the new portamedic delivery model and will continue to modify and expand the model  with the expectation of a favorable impact on future portamedic revenues 
nonetheless  in response to the declining revenues in the fourth quarter of  we implemented additional actions to reduce our costs and cash outflows  including headcount reductions and a reduction in capital expenditures and operating expenses 
the actions taken are expected to reduce or delay expenses and uses of cash during and thereafter 
if the new portamedic delivery model is not successful and revenues continue to decline  operating losses will continue  further asset impairments may occur and the company will be required to take additional actions to further reduce or delay expenses and uses of cash 
this would also reduce our cash reserves and would require us to borrow against our new loan and security agreement 
there is no guarantee that the portamedic delivery model will reverse the decline in revenues or that our cost reduction actions will generate the savings necessary to offset revenues declines  operating losses and uses of cash 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in reversing past revenue declines and cost reduction initiatives cannot be implemented to offset revenue declines  we may fail to satisfy the financial covenants maintained in the loan and security agreement  as discussed in note to our financial statements 
our failure to comply with these financial covenants may limit or eliminate our borrowing capacity under the terms of our loan and security agreement 
these and other factors would adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to generate profits in the future 
based on our anticipated level of future revenues  the cost reduction initiatives implemented to date  our existing cash and cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity  we believe we have sufficient funds to meet our cash needs through december  cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities of continuing operations was million 
our net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively

changes in working capital items included a decrease in accounts receivable of million  primarily due to reduced revenues during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of our consolidated days sales outstanding dso  measured on a rolling day basis was days at december   compared to days at december  historically  our accounts receivable balances and our dso are at their lowest point in december as many of our customers utilize the remainder of their operating budgets before their year end budget close out 
as a result  our dso historically declines at year end compared to other months during the year

for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations was million consisting of proceeds received from stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  offset by reduction in our capital lease obligations and costs associated with our loan and security agreement with td bank 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
share repurchases we did not purchase any shares of our common stock during  or dividends no dividends were paid in  or we are precluded from declaring or making any dividend payments or other distributions of assets with respect to any class of our equity securities under the terms of our loan and security agreement with keltic financial partners ii  lp see note to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our schedule of contractual obligations at december   including future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating and capital leases  and employment contract payments

critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of a company s operating results and or financial condition and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these determinations upon the best information available to us during the period in which we are accounting for our results 
our estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change or as further information becomes available 
further  these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
changes in our estimates are recorded in the period the change occurs 
we have identified the accounting policies discussed below as critical to us 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for paramedical and medical examinations when the examination of the insurance policy applicant is completed 
revenues generated from medical record collection  laboratory testing  fingerstick test kits  health wellness screenings  and other services are recognized when the related service is completed 
in all cases  there must be evidence of an agreement with the customer  the sales price must be fixed or determinable  delivery of services must occur and the ability to collect must be reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for i estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  and ii estimated amounts that customers may deduct from their remittances to us for billed items not in compliance with customer specifications 
management regularly assesses the financial condition of our customers  the markets in which these customers participate as well as historical trends relating to customer deductions and adjusts the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this review 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  our ability to collect on accounts receivable could be negatively impacted  in which case additional allowances may be required 
we must make significant management judgments and estimates in determining allowances for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
one significant uncertainty inherent in our analysis is whether our past experience will be indicative of future periods 
adverse changes in general economic conditions could affect our allowance estimates  collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is a condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the following are examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the long lived asset  a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the process to identify if there is impairment includes the following steps a comparison of the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the long lived assets or asset group to the carrying value of the long lived assets or asset group  and if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows  an impairment is identified 
the amount of the impairment is based on the excess of the carrying value of the long lived assets to its fair value 
we estimate the fair value of the long lived assets based on discounted cash flow models 
in june  our portamedic service line deployed its new model for delivering paramedical exam services 
this new model utilizes the following internal use software i partnerlink  a new workflow system for portamedic operations  ii eportamedic 
com  a new web based ordering system  and iii iparamed e exam platform  whereby our health professionals utilize an iparamed equipped netbook to complete exams 
when deployed in june  the new portamedic delivery model was expected to reduce costs and improve service leading to an improvement in past revenue declines 
in the third quarter of  although the expected cost reductions were achieved  portamedic revenue showed no improvement in comparison to the first half of revenue declines 
given the complexity of the new delivery model branch office closures  centralization of services  we believed it was too soon to assess the long term impact on revenues 
however in the fourth quarter of and continuing in  portamedic revenue declines continued and accelerated compared to pre june revenue declines  thus triggering us to perform an impairment evaluation of the above described long lived assets 
the evaluation resulted in the determination that the carrying values of certain long lived assets exceeded their projected undiscounted net cash flows 
with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we calculated the fair values of these long lived assets 
the significant assumptions that we were required to make include estimated future cash flows  estimated discount rate  and identification of market participants and the cost synergies they would employ 
the fair values were determined based on discounted cash flows and indicated that an impairment existed for each of these portamedic long lived assets 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million which is included in impairment of long lived assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  management  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  has concluded that the book value of the remaining assets as of december  associated with the portamedic service line equal or are less than their fair value 
in connection with the restructure of portamedic operations  we recorded charges totaling million related to the impairment of fixed assets for branch offices closed primarily during the third quarter of additionally  we recorded a charge of million related to the impairment of hooper holmes services long lived assets 
these charges are included in impairment of long lived assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on the continued decline in revenues  the cumulative tax and operating losses  the lack of taxes in the carryback period and the uncertainty surrounding the extent or timing of future taxable income  we do not believe that we will realize the tax benefits of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we continue to record a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
share based compensation authoritative accounting literature addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this literature establishes accounting principles which require companies to recognize compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payments  such as stock options or non vested stock granted to employees 
compensation cost for stock options and non vested stock is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant 
the accounting principles also require that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share based awards 
we monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model 
the estimated fair values of options are based on assumptions  including estimated lives  volatility  dividend yield  and risk free interest rates 
these estimates also consider the probability that the options will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder  which are based on reasonable estimates and historical trends but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our credit facility is based on variable rates and is therefore subject to interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  our interest expense will vary as a result of interest rate changes and the level of any outstanding borrowings 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding 
as of december   we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such date
