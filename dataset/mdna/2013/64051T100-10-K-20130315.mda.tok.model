item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis by our management of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part i of this annual report on form k regarding forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors of this annual report on form k 
business overview we are a leading designer and manufacturer of photonic integrated circuit  or pic based optoelectronic modules and subsystems for bandwidth intensive  high speed communications networks 
our products are designed to enable high speed transmission rates and efficient allocation of bandwidth over optical networks with high quality and low costs 
our pic technology utilizes proprietary design elements that provide optical functionality on a silicon or indium phosphide or hybrid chip 
pic devices can integrate many more functional elements than discretely packaged components  enabling increased functionality in a small form factor while reducing packaging and interconnection costs 
in addition  the cost advantages of pic based components are similar to the economics of semiconductor wafer mass manufacturing  where the marginal cost of producing an incremental chip is much less than that of a discrete component 
we have research and development and wafer fabrication facilities in san jose and fremont  california which coordinate with our research and development and manufacturing facilities in shenzhen and wuhan  china  tokyo  japan  and ottawa  canada 
we utilize proprietary design tools and design for manufacturing techniques to align our design process with our precision nanoscale  vertically integrated manufacturing and testing capabilities 
we sell our products to the leading network equipment vendors globally  including adva ag optical networking ltd  alcatel lucent sa  ciena corporation  cisco systems  inc  eci telecom ltd  telefonaktiebolaget lm ericsson  fiberhome technologies group  fujitsu limited  huawei technologies co  ltd  juniper networks  inc  mitsubishi electric corporation  nec corporation  nokia siemens networks bv and zte corporation 
we refer to these companies as our tier customers 
in february  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  including the full underwriters over allotment option  at a public offering price of per share 
our initial public offering generated net proceeds of million before offering expenses 
in connection with the closing of the initial public offering  all of the shares of our series  series and series preferred stock then outstanding automatically converted into  shares of common stock on a for basis and all of the shares of our series x preferred stock then outstanding automatically converted into  shares of common stock on a for basis 
in october  we acquired santur corporation  a designer and manufacturer of indium phosphide inp based pic products 
the acquisition of santure enhances the company s position in pic based modules and subsystmes for high speed networks 
on april   we issued and sold approximately million shares of our common stock in a private placement transaction at a price of per share for gross proceeds of approximately million 
the shares of common stock are restricted from transfer pursuant to a lockup agreement for up to two years  at the end of which we are obligated to file one or more registration statements covering the potential resale of the shares of common stock 
we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock for 
table of contents general corporate purposes and to establish a presence in the russian federation 
in addition  we intend to establish a production facility in the russian federation  in accordance with the terms of a rights agreement entered into in connection with the private placement  for the benefit of the global organization 
the expansion into the russian federation is targeted for completion by july  in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a plan to sell a component of our business  shenzhen photon broadband technology co  ltd 
broadband  a subsidiary in china 
in january  we entered into a purchase agreement with a third party to dispose of our equity interest in broadband for a total cash consideration of rmb million million  and the transaction closed in march the net assets of broadband were classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets and the results of operations associated with broadband are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
unless otherwise indicated  all discussions relate to our continuing operations 
as a result of the sale of a component of our business in the first quarter of  our audited consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes and other information provided in this form k reflect broadband as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
in  our revenue growth of over the prior year was driven primarily by increasing in demand for our gbps and gbps speed products  which grew by over over the prior year  as carriers continued to accelerate deployment of high capacity optical transport networks 
we operated a sales model that focused on direct alignment with our customers through coordination of our sales  product engineering and manufacturing teams 
our sales and marketing organizations supported our strategy of increasing product penetration with our tier customers while also serving our broader customer base 
we used a direct sales force in the us  china  canada  israel  japan  the russian federation and the european union 
these individuals worked with our product engineers  and product marketing and sales operations teams  in an integrated approach to address our customers current and future needs 
we also engaged independent commissioned representatives worldwide to extend our global reach 
we expect to continue experiencing competition from companies that range from large international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets 
we anticipate macroeconomic conditions  including the slow recovery in the us  european sovereign debt issues  and concerns relating to inflation in china  could impact our company s results 
on january   we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the optical semiconductor business unit of lapis semiconductor co  ltd 
ocu 
ocu is a leading provider of lasers  drivers  and detectors for high speed g applications located in japan 
when closed  we believe this acquisition will enhance our competitive position in g products 
we expect this transaction to be completed in the first or second quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and cash flow  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation expense  impairment analysis of goodwill and long lived assets  valuation of inventory  warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results  our future financial statements will be affected 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
contracts and or customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customer s payment history 
we recognize revenue when the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer 
we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point 
on most orders  our terms of sale provide that title passes to the buyer upon shipment by us 
in certain cases  our terms of sale may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer 
revenue related to the sale of consignment inventory at vendor managed locations is not recognized until the product is pulled from inventory stock by customers 
we determine payments made to third party sales representatives are appropriately recorded to sales and marketing expense and not a reduction of revenue as the sales agent services they provide have an identifiable benefit and are made at similar rates of other sales agent service providers 
shipping and handling costs are included in the cost of goods sold 
we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 
stock based compensation expense we grant stock options  stock purchase rights  stock appreciation units and restricted stock units to employees and directors 
the stock based awards are accounted for at fair value as of the measurement date 
for stock options and restricted stock units  the measurement date is the grant date and for stock purchase rights the measurement date is the first day of the offering period 
stock appreciation units are subject to re measurement each reporting period 
we recognize the fair value over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period on a straight line basis 
stock based compensation expense includes the impact of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate future forfeitures at the date of grant and revise the estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we account for stock based compensation using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
if any of these assumptions used in the option pricing models change  our stock based compensation expense could change on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
in fiscal year  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its guidance to simplify testing goodwill for impairment 
the amended guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
if an entity determines that as a result of the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the quantitative test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests on december  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million due to a decline in our market capitalization during the fourth quarter of  the result of which is that we do not have any goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and 
table of contents long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
if our estimates regarding future cash flows derived from such assets were to change  we may record an impairment to the value of these assets 
we did not record any asset impairment charges during the years ended december   or valuation of inventories we record inventories at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market  after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventories in excess of anticipated future demand 
in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories  we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand  the timing of new product introductions  economic trends and market conditions 
if the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs which would be charged to cost of goods sold 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles 
increases to the provision for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of goods sold 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower cost inventory is subsequently sold  it will result in lower costs and higher gross margin for those products 
any write downs would have an adverse impact on our gross margin 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded excess and obsolete inventory charges of million  million and million  respectively 
warranty liabilities we provide warranties to cover defects in workmanship  materials and manufacturing of our products for a period of one to two years to meet stated functionality specifications 
from time to time  we have agreed  and may agree  to warranty provisions providing for extended terms or with a greater scope 
we test products against specified functionality requirements prior to delivery  but we nevertheless from time to time experience claims under our warranty guarantees 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs under those guarantees based upon historical experience  and for specific items at the time their existence is known and the amounts are determinable 
we charge a provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities to cost of goods sold based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures 
if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected  our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected 
we recorded warranty expense of million  million and million for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes we record income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  generally we consider all expected future events  other than enactments or changes in tax law or rates 
we provide valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
we provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws 
tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits  relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period 
changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies 

table of contents as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
results of operations the following table presents certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenue years ended december  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets adjustment to fair value of contingent consideration goodwill impairment charges restructuring charges total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net total interest and other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss revenue in thousands  except percentages change to change to total revenue we sell substantially all of our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
we recognize revenue upon delivery of our product to the oem 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions and may 
table of contents periodically reduce the price of our products as market and competitive conditions change and as manufacturing costs are reduced 
our sales transactions to customers are denominated primarily in chinese renminbi rmb or us dollars 
revenue is driven by the volume of shipments and may be impacted by pricing pressures 
we have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
given the high concentration of network equipment vendors in our industry  our top ten customers represented  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
in  we made substantial progress to reduce customer concentration

for the year ended december   and  our sales from our china based subsidiaries  the majority of which were denominated in rmb were  and  respectively 
total revenue increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
this increase in revenue was primarily attributable to growth in our high speed g and g products which generally have higher average selling prices as compared to more mature products 
our high speed g products grew more than from to total revenue increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to increases in demand for our products as carriers continued to deploy fiber to home solutions and deploy gbps  gbps and other telecom networks 
on a global basis  in we experienced greater revenue growth from western customers compared to customers located in china  while in the increase in revenue was primarily realized in china and to a lesser extent in the us in  we expect our revenue to continue to grow 
we also expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers  as a result of growth in purchases by our key china  us and european customers 
as a result  the loss of  or a significant reduction in orders from our largest customer  huawei technologies or any of our other key customers would materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
we expect a significant portion of our sales to continue to be denominated in rmb  and therefore may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 
cost of goods sold and gross profit in thousands  except percentages change to change to cost of goods sold gross profit gross profit represents net sales less cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of the cost to produce wafers and to manufacture and test our products 
additionally  our cost of goods sold includes stock based compensation  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  royalty payments  amortization of certain purchased intangible assets and acquisition related fair value adjustments  and warranty  shipping and allocated facilities costs 
gross profit increased by million in compared to  and was primarily due to sales mix and growth in our g and g products  given these products tend to have higher margins on average compared to our other products 
gross profit decreased by million in compared to  and was primarily due to additional cost of goods sold of million including amortization of intangible and other fixed manufacturing costs associated with the acquisition of santur in the impact from the acquisition of santur in was partially offset by overall continuous pricing reductions in material purchases and higher efficiencies in manufacturing 
we expect that our gross profit is likely to continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors  including the introduction of new products  production volume  production volume compared to sales over time  the mix of 
table of contents products sold  inventory changes  changes in the average selling prices of our products  changes in the cost and volumes of materials purchased from our suppliers  changes in labor costs  changes in overhead costs or requirements  revaluation of stock appreciation unit awards that are impacted by our stock price  and any reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
in addition  we periodically negotiate pricing with certain customers which can cause our gross margins to fluctuate particularly in the quarters in which the negotiations occurred 
we strive to increase our gross margin as we seek to manage the costs of our supply chain and increase productivity in our manufacturing processes 
operating expenses in thousands  except percentages change to change to research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of purchase intangible assets adjustment to fair value of contingent consideration goodwill impairment charges restructuring charges total operating expenses research and development research and development expense consists of personnel costs  including stock based compensation  our research and development personnel  and product development costs  including engineering services  development software and hardware tools  depreciation of capital equipment and facility costs 
we record all research and development expense as incurred 
research and development expense increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in additional compensation and employee related costs mainly due to the acquisition of santur in the fourth quarter of  million increase in depreciation expense and million increase in stock based compensation expense 
research and development expense increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in additional compensation and employee related costs as a result of increased headcount and our acquisition of santur  and a million per quarter increase in material consumption  facility costs and equipment usage to support our research and development projects 
we believe that investments in research and development are important to help meet our strategic objectives 
in  we plan to continue to invest in research and development and new products that will further enhance our competitive position 
as a percentage of total revenue  our research and development expense may vary as our investment levels and revenue change over time 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs  including stock based compensation and sales commissions  costs related to sales and marketing programs and services and facility costs

as a percentage of total revenue  our general and administrative expense may vary as our revenue changes over time 
amortization of purchased intangible assets our intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives 
amortization expense relating to technology and patents and leasehold interests are included within cost of goods sold  while customer relationships and noncompete agreements are recorded within operating expenses 
amortization of purchased intangible assets increased by million in compared to  representing a increase 
this was primarily due to assets acquired from santur in the fourth quarter of amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by million in compared to  representing a decrease 
the decreases were primarily due to some of intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the second half of  partially offset by an increase in amortization expense related to assets acquired from santur in the fourth quarter of adjustment to the fair value of contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of santur  we may be required to pay up to an additional million in cash as further consideration for the business acquisition  contingent upon santur s gross profit performance during the fair value of the contingent consideration is re measured each reporting period and any changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized as a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations

goodwill impairment charge due to the decrease in our market capitalization as of the end of the fourth quarter of  and based on our assessment  we determined that the indicators of impairment existed and that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable 
as a result  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million  representing the entire balance of our goodwill 
as of december  and  we had no goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan  which resulted in the involuntary termination of employees in the us and employees in china 
the reduction in workforce was primarily related to cost cutting measures in research and development 
in addition  we made reductions in the areas of sales  marketing and administrative functions as a result of redundancy in positions due to the acquisition of santur in october as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for severance and benefit costs in and we recorded an incremental restructuring charge of  related to this restructuring plan during as of december   all of the restructuring expense was paid

income taxes years ended december  in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes effective tax rate 
table of contents we conduct our business globally 
therefore  our operating income is subject to varying rates of tax in the us  china and other various foreign jurisdictions 
consequently  our effective tax rate is dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region 
we expect that our income taxes will vary in relation to our profitability and the geographic distribution of our profits 
historically  we have experienced net losses in the us and in the short term  we expect this trend to continue 
in china  one of our subsidiaries has qualified for a preferential tax rate available for high technology enterprises 
the preferential rate applies to  and we realized benefits from this reduction in tax rate of million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
the preferential rate has been approved to remain at for and in order to retain the preferential rate  we must meet certain operating conditions  satisfy certain product requirements  meet certain headcount requirements and maintain certain levels of research expenditures 
the preferential tax rate that we enjoy could be modified or discontinued altogether at any time  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the introduction of new and enhanced products  the costs to increase our manufacturing capacity  the continuing market acceptance of our products and acquisitions of businesses and technology 
in the event that additional financing is required from outside sources  we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when desired  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
a customary business practice in china is for customers to exchange our accounts receivable with notes receivable issued by their bank

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuation risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in a variety of securities  including us government agency securities  corporate notes and bonds  foreign bonds and money market funds meeting certain criteria 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
consequently  our available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses 
we have determined that the gross unrealized gains or losses on the available for sale securities at december  are temporary in nature 
we may sell these marketable securities investments in the future to fund future operating needs 
as a result  we recorded all our marketable securities in short term investments as of december   regardless of the contractual maturity date of the securities 
we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates associated with certain outstanding balances under our debt instruments 
as of december  and  we did not have outstanding debt in china 
as of december  and  our us debt was based on floating rates of interest and is subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
as of december  and  we had not hedged our interest rate risk 
as of december  and  we had million and million outstanding under our us credit facilities  respectively  which was subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rate could result in approximately  of additional annual interest expense 
comparatively  for the year ended december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rate could result in approximately  of additional annual interest 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future 
furthermore  the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time 
as a result  actual impacts on our results of operations in the future will differ from those quantified above 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk foreign currency exchange rates are subject to fluctuation and may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations 
a substantial portion of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries in china whose functional currency is the rmb 
to the extent that transactions by our subsidiaries in china are denominated in currencies other than rmb  we bear the risk that fluctuations in the exchange rates of the rmb in relation to other currencies could decrease our revenue and increase our costs and expenses 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized foreign currency transaction losses of million and million  respectively 
we use the us dollar as the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements 
any significant revaluation of the rmb may materially and adversely affect our results of operations upon translation of our chinese subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
while we generate a significant portion of our revenue in rmb  a majority of our operating expenses are in us dollars 
therefore depreciation in rmb against the us dollar would negatively impact our revenue upon translation to the us dollars but the impact on operating expenses would be less 
for example  for the year ended december   a depreciation in rmb against the us dollar would have resulted in an million decrease in our revenue and a million increase in our net loss for the period 
comparatively  for the year ended december   a depreciation in rmb against the us dollar would have resulted in a million decrease in our revenue and a million decrease in our net income for the period 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure 
in addition  our currency exchange variations may be magnified by any chinese exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert rmb into foreign currency 
inflation risk inflationary factors  such as increases in our cost of goods sold and operating expenses  may adversely affect our results of operations 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  an increase in the rate of inflation in the future  particularly in china  may have an adverse effect on our levels of gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue if the sales prices for our products do not proportionately increase with these increased expenses
