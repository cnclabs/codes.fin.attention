all references to numbered notes are to specific footnotes to our consolidated and combined financial statements included in this annual report 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements  the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
capitalized terms used  but not defined  in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a have the same meanings as in such notes 
overview introduction as of december   our portfolio consisted of regional malls in states totaling over million square feet of retail and ancillary space 
we elected to be treated as a reit in connection 
table of contents with the filing of our federal income tax return for the taxable year 
subject to our ability to meet the requirements of a reit  we intend to maintain this status in future periods 
the majority of the income from our properties is derived from rents received through long term leases with retail tenants 
these long term leases generally require the tenants to pay base rent which is a fixed amount specified in the lease 
the base rent is often subject to scheduled increases during the term of the lease 
our financial statements refer to this as minimum rents 
certain of our leases also include a component which requires tenants to pay amounts related to all or substantially all of their share of real estate taxes and certain property operating expenses  including common area maintenance and insurance 
the revenue earned attributable to real estate tax and operating expense recoveries are recorded as tenant recoveries 
another component of income is overage rent 
overage rent is paid by a tenant when its sales exceed an agreed upon minimum amount 
overage rent is calculated by multiplying the tenant sales in excess of the minimum amount by a percentage defined in the lease  the majority of which is typically earned in the fourth quarter 
our objective is to achieve high growth in noi  core noi  ffo and core ffo see selected financial data real estate property net operating income and core net operating income and selected financial data funds from operations and core funds from operations by leasing  operating and repositioning retail properties with locations that are either market dominant the only mall within an extended distance to service the trade area or trade area dominant positioned to be the premier mall serving the defined regional consumer 
we plan to continue to control costs and to deliver an appropriate tenant mix  higher occupancy rates and increased sales productivity  resulting in higher minimum rents 
we believe that the most significant operating factor affecting incremental cash flow  noi  core noi  ffo and core ffo is increased rents earned from tenants at our properties 
these rental revenue increases are primarily achieved by increasing occupancy at the properties so that more space is generating rent  increasing tenant sales in which we participate through overage rent  re leasing existing space and renewing expiring leases at rates higher than expiring or existing rates  and prudently investing capital into our properties 
overview basis of presentation we were formed in august for the purpose of holding certain assets and assuming certain liabilities of ggp 
following the distribution of these assets and liabilities to us on january   we began operating our business as a stand alone owner and operator of regional malls 
the financial information included in this annual report has been presented on a consolidated basis for the period after the spin off date 
the financial information is presented on a combined basis prior to the spin off date as the entities were under common control and ownership  and reflects the allocation of certain overhead items within property management and other costs in the accompanying combined financial statements 
in april  ggp filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter on the effective date  ggp emerged from chapter bankruptcy after receiving a significant equity infusion from investors and other associated events 
as a result of the emergence from bankruptcy and the related equity infusion  the majority of equity in ggp changed ownership  which triggered the application of acquisition accounting to the assets and liabilities of ggp 
as a result  the application of acquisition accounting has been applied to the assets and liabilities of rouse properties and  therefore  the financial results presented in this md a have been presented separately for the predecessor and 
table of contents successor for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional detail 
the historical combined financial information included in this annual report prior to the spin off date does not necessarily reflect the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate  publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors prior to the spin off  our business was operated by ggp as part of its broader corporate organization  rather than as a separate  stand alone company 
ggp or its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us  including  but not limited to  property management  human resources  security  payroll and benefits  legal  corporate communications  information services and restructuring and reorganization 
costs of the services that were allocated or charged to us were based on either actual costs incurred or a proportion of costs estimated to be applicable to us based on a number of factors  most significantly our percentage of ggp adjusted revenue  gross leasable area of assets and also the number of properties 
our historical financial results reflect allocations for certain corporate costs and we believe such allocations are reasonable  however  such results do not reflect what our expenses would have been had we been operating as a separate  stand alone public company 
prior to the spin off  portions of our business were integrated with the other businesses of ggp 
historically  we have shared economies of scope and scale in costs  employees  vendor relationships and certain customer relationships 
we entered into a transition services agreement with ggp that governs certain commercial and other relationships 
these contractual arrangements may not capture the benefits our business has enjoyed as a result of being integrated with ggp and the transition services will only be provided for a limited period of time 
the loss of these benefits of scope and scale may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations to provide a more meaningful comparison between annual periods  we have aggregated the predecessor results for with the successor results 
the successor results reflect the application of acquisition accounting  therefore  the combined results will not be indicative of the results of operations in the predecessor and successor periods had they been presented consistently 

table of contents year ended december  and december  december  change change in thousands revenues minimum rents tenant recoveries overage rents other total revenues expenses real estate taxes property maintenance costs marketing other property operating costs provision for doubtful accounts general and administrative depreciation and amortization other total expenses operating income interest income interest expense loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss revenues total revenues decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the comparable properties between and decreased approximately million during which is offset by an increase of million from property acquisitions 
the million decline for comparable property revenue is primarily related to declines in minimum rents and tenant recoveries of million and million 
the decline is primarily due to lease expirations  various tenants that converted lease structure to a gross rental or a percentage in lieu of base rent leases 
operating expenses property operating expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
property operating expenses include real estate taxes  property maintenance costs  marketing  other property operating costs  and provision for doubtful accounts 
the comparable properties between and increased approximately million and property acquisitions contributed to the remaining million increase 
the comparable property increase of million is primarily related to increases in other property operating costs of million and provision for doubtful accounts of million 
other property operating costs increased due to professional fees incurred at the property level and provision for doubtful accounts increased due to a million recovery that was received in that was previously written off as a bad debt expense 

table of contents general and administrative increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase is due to the fact that we assumed responsibility for certain overhead costs which include costs related to property management  human resources  accounting  security  payroll and benefits  legal  corporate communications and information services 
for the year ended december   the million of costs were charged or allocated to us based on ggp corporate costs based on a number of factors  most significantly our percentage of ggp adjusted revenue  gross leaseable area of assets and the number of properties 
depreciation and amortization decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the change is primarily due to the decrease in amortization of in place leases due to tenant lease expirations 
other expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year primarily due to initial costs incurred by the company during its first year of stand alone operations 
these other costs include million in signing bonuses  million for severance expenses  million for temporary employees for the formation of the company  and other initial formation costs 
other income and expenses interest income increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase is due to the interest income earned on the demand deposit from brookfield us holdings  see note to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
interest expense increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily related to deferred financing amortization  write off of deferred financing costs  write off of market rate adjustments and interest expense incurred 
the company incurred million in amortization of deferred financing costs for the year ended december  as a result of the additional deferred financing costs associated with the refinancings completed by the company during as compared to no amortization of deferred financing costs for the year ended december  furthermore  the company incurred million in write off of deferred financing costs for the year ended december  as a result of the write off of the term loan deferred financing costs associated with the pierre bossier  southland center  and animas valley malls as compared to no write off of deferred financing costs for the year ended december  the company also wrote off million of market rate adjustments on loans that were paid off on the spin off date 
the remainder of the change was due to the increase in debt and interest rates within the overall portfolio 
year ended december  and the following table sets forth our results of operations as reported in our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with gaap 
gaap requires that we separately present our predecessor and successor periods results 
management believes that reviewing our operating results for the year ended december  by combining the results of the predecessor and successor periods is more useful in identifying any trends in  or reaching conclusions regarding  our overall operating performance 
accordingly  the table below presents the non gaap combined results for the year ended december   which is also the period we compare when computing percentage change from prior year  as we believe this presentation provides the most meaningful basis for comparison of our results and it is how management reviews operating performance 
the combined operating results may not reflect the actual results we would have achieved had the emergence from 
table of contents bankruptcy occurred prior to november  and may not be predictive of future results of operations 
successor predecessor year ended december  period from november  through december  period from january  through november  year ended december  change change in thousands revenues minimum rents tenant recoveries overage rents other total revenues expenses real estate taxes property maintenance costs marketing other property operating costs provision for doubtful accounts general and administrative depreciation and amortization other total expenses operating income interest income interest expense loss before income taxes provision for income taxes reorganization items net loss revenues total revenues decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to minimum rents and tenant recoveries 
minimum rents decreased approximately million due to incurring a full year of above and below market rent amortization and straight line rent during as compared to one and a half months in  which reflects the impact of the application of the acquisition method of accounting in the fourth quarter of tenant recoveries decreased million for the year ended december  primarily due to the conversion of certain tenants to gross leases 

table of contents operating expenses property operating expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
property operating expenses include real estate taxes  property maintenance costs  marketing  other property operating costs  and provision for doubtful accounts 
other property operating costs increased million primarily due to a million favorable adjustment in related to the final settlements of the termination of utility contracts that were subject to compromise and a million increase in electric expenses compared to the prior year and a million increase in contract services for cleaning  landscapers  and professional services 
the provision for doubtful accounts decreased by million primarily due to improved collections of outstanding accounts receivable in the year ended december  in addition to the higher allowances in the same period of related to tenant bankruptcies and weaker economic conditions 
general and administrative increased million for the year ended december  due to an increase in overhead costs allocated to the properties due to ggp having fewer properties to allocate expenses to in compared to  without a corresponding decrease in such overhead costs 
depreciation and amortization increased million for the year ended december  primarily due to the impact of the application of the acquisition method of accounting in the fourth quarter of other expenses increased million for the year ended december  primarily due to professional and audit fees related to the distribution and rights offering 
other income and expenses net interest expense decreased million for the year ended december  primarily due to a million decrease of amortization of the market rate adjustments related to the fair value of debt and a million decrease in mortgage interest expense primarily due to the repayment of debt for mall st 
vincent and southland center on april  and gateway mall on june  reorganization items under the bankruptcy filings are expense or income items that were incurred or realized in connection with the bankruptcy of ggp 
these items include professional fees and similar types of expenses incurred that are directly related to the bankruptcy filings  gains or losses resulting from activities of the reorganization process  including gains related to recording the mortgage debt at fair value upon emergence from bankruptcy and interest earned on cash accumulated by ggp 
bankruptcy related items incurred after the effective date are reported within other expense 
liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of cash include payment of operating expenses  working capital  debt repayment  including principal and interest  reinvestment in properties  development and redevelopment of properties  acquisitions  tenant allowance  and dividends 
our primary sources of cash are operating cash flow  refinancings of existing loans  equity previously raised from our rights offering  borrowings under our revolver and borrowings under our subordinated revolving credit facility as described under financings below and the funds of our demand deposit 
our short term less than one year liquidity requirements include recurring operating costs  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  and dividend requirements on our shares of common stock 
we anticipate that these needs will be met primarily with cash flows provided by operations 
our long term greater than one year liquidity requirements include scheduled debt maturities  capital expenditures to maintain  renovate and expand existing malls  property acquisitions  and development projects 
management anticipates that net cash provided by the operating activities  the 
table of contents funds available under our revolver and subordinated facility  as described under financings below  and funds of our demand deposit will provide sufficient capital resources meet our long term liquidity requirements 
we have identified opportunities to invest significant capital to reposition and refresh certain of our properties  and presently we will sequence long term redevelopment projects with leasing activity 
for a discussion of factors that could have an impact on our ability to realize these goals  see risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
as of december   our combined contractual debt  excluding non cash debt market rate adjustments  was approximately billion 
the aggregate principal and interest payments due on our outstanding indebtedness as of december  is approximately million for the year ending and approximately million for the year ending our future financial and operating performance  ability to service or refinance our debt and ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our debt agreements will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
see risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
financings senior secured credit facility 
on the spin off date  we entered into a senior secured credit facility senior facility with a syndicate of banks  as lenders  and wells fargo bank  national association  as administrative agent  and wells fargo securities  llc  rbc capital markets  llc  and us bank national association  as joint lead arrangers  that provides borrowings on a revolving basis of up to million the revolver and a senior secured term loan the term loan and together with the revolver  the facilities which provided an advance of approximately million 
the facilities closed concurrently with the consummation of the spin off and have a term of three years 
the interest rate was based on one month libor  with a libor floor of plus for the period from january  through september  the company renegotiated the facilities on september  and the interest rate on the borrowings under the facilities  effective that date  is libor  with no libor floor  plus 
in the event of default  the default interest rate will be more than the then applicable interest rate 
during the period ended december   the outstanding balance on the term loan decreased from million to million due to the repayments on the term loan concurrent with the refinancing of the pierre bossier  southland center  and animas valley malls 
furthermore  on january  we utilized funds that were previously on deposit with brookfield us holdings to pay down our term loan by million resulting in a current balance of million 
in addition  we increased the revolver commitment from million to million to maintain our current level of liquidity 
the revolver commitment is currently undrawn as of march  in addition  we are required to pay an unused fee  paid quarterly in arrears  related to the revolver equal to per year if the aggregate unused amount is greater than or equal to of the revolver or per year if the aggregate unused amount is less that of the revolver 
as of december   no amounts were drawn on our revolver 
we have entered into a hedge transaction related to a portion of our term loan at a cost of approximately million 
this hedge transaction was for an interest rate cap with a notional amount of million and caps the daily libor at 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate cap was the interest rate cap expired on january  the senior facility has affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for a real estate loan  including  without limitation  restrictions on incurrence of indebtedness and liens on the mortgage 
table of contents collateral  restrictions on pledges  restrictions on subsidiary distributions  with respect to the mortgage collateral  limitations on our ability to enter into transactions including mergers  consolidations  sales of assets for less than fair market value and similar transactions  conduct of business  restricted distributions  transactions with affiliates  and limitation on speculative hedge agreements 
in addition  we are required to comply with financial maintenance covenants relating to the following net indebtedness to value ratio  liquidity  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum tangible net worth  and minimum portfolio debt yield 
failure to comply with the covenants in the senior facility would result in a default under the credit agreement governing the facilities and  absent a waiver or an amendment from our lenders  permit the acceleration of all outstanding borrowings under the senior facility  which would also result in a cross default of our subordinated facility as described below 
the company is in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants as of december  subordinated revolving credit facility 
on the spin off date we also entered into a subordinated unsecured revolving credit facility with a wholly owned subsidiary of brookfield asset management  inc  a related party  that provides borrowings on a revolving basis of up to million the subordinated facility 
the subordinated facility has a term of three years and six months and will bear interest at libor with a libor floor of plus 
the default interest rate following a payment event of default under the subordinated facility will be more than the then applicable interest rate 
interest will be payable monthly 
in addition  we are required to pay a semi annual revolving credit fee of million 
as of december   no amounts have been drawn from the subordinated facility 
property level debt 
we have individual property level debt the property level debt on of our assets  representing approximately  million excluding million of market rate adjustments 
the property level debt has a weighted average interest rate of and an average remaining term of years 
the property level debt is stand alone not cross collateralized first mortgage debt and is non recourse with the exception of customary contingent guarantees indemnities 
redevelopment we continue to evaluate and execute in the redevelopment of various malls within our portfolio 
a component of our business strategy is to identify value creation initiatives for our properties and to then invest significant capital to reposition and refresh our properties 
these redevelopment opportunities are typically completed in conjunction with leasing activity for that respective space 
we anticipate funding our redevelopment projects with the net cash provided by operating activities  borrowings under our revolver  borrowings under our subordinated revolving credit facility and the funds of our demand deposit 
we have started redevelopment projects at two of our malls  lakeland mall in lakeland  fl  and silver lake mall in coeur d alene  id 
we anticipate investing approximately million during the next to renovate these malls to convert vacant anchor space and unproductive in line space to space for tenants such as cinemark theaters  the sports authority  and jo anns fabrics 
summary of cash flows years ended december   and cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   million for the period from november  through december   and million for the period from january  through november  
table of contents net cash provided by certain assets and liabilities  including accounts receivable  prepaid expense and other assets  deferred expenses  restricted cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   million for the period from november  through december   and million for the period from january  through november  cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   million for the period from november  through december   and million for the period from january  through november  cash used for acquisition development of real estate and property additions improvements was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   million for the period from november  through december   and million for the period from january  through november  during the year ended december   the company placed million into an interest bearing account with brookfield us holdings 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   for the year ended december   million for the period from november  through december   and million for the period from january  through november  principal payments were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   million for the period from november  through december   and million for the period from january  through november  during the year ended december   the company also received million in proceeds from refinancings issuances of mortgage  notes  and loans payable as a result of the term loan  pierre bossier  southland center  and animas valley loans 
the company also completed its rights offering during the year ended december  which resulted in gross proceeds from this offering of million 
contractual cash obligations and commitments the following table aggregates our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december  subsequent total in thousands long term debt principal interest payments operating lease obligations total excludes million of non cash debt market rate adjustments 
based on rates as of december  variable rates are based on libor rate of 
in the normal course of business  from time to time  we are involved in legal proceedings relating to the ownership and operations of our properties 
see legal proceedings 

table of contents we lease land or buildings at certain properties from third parties 
the leases generally provide us with a right of first refusal in the event of a proposed sale of the property by the landlord 
rental payments are expensed as incurred and have  to the extent applicable  been straight lined over the term of the lease 
off balance sheet financing arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
reit requirements in order to maintain our qualification as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes  among other requirements  we must distribute or pay tax on of our capital gains and we must distribute at least of our ordinary taxable income to stockholders 
to avoid current entity level us federal income taxes  we plan to distribute of our capital gains and ordinary income to our stockholders annually 
we may not have sufficient liquidity to meet these distribution requirements 
we have no present intention to pay any dividends on our common stock in the future other than in order to maintain our reit status  which dividends our board of directors may decide to pay in the form of cash  common stock or a combination of cash and common stock 
seasonality although we have a year long temporary leasing program  occupancies for short term tenants and  therefore  rental income recognized  are higher during the second half of the year 
in addition  the majority of our tenants have december or january lease years for purposes of calculating annual overage rent amounts 
accordingly  overage rent thresholds are most commonly achieved in the fourth quarter 
as a result  revenue production is generally highest in the fourth quarter of each year 
competition for a discussion of the competition we face  see business competition 
environmental for a discussion of environmental factors that may affect us  see business environmental 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
for example  estimates and assumptions have been made with respect to fair values of assets and liabilities for purposes of applying the acquisition method of accounting  the useful lives of assets  capitalization of development and leasing costs  recoverable amounts of receivables  initial valuations and related amortization periods of deferred costs and intangibles  particularly with respect to acquisitions  impairment of long lived assets  fair value of debt  and valuation of stock options granted 
actual results could differ from these and other estimates 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both significant to the overall presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
our critical accounting policies are those applicable to the following real estate properties acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the acquisition method of accounting 
estimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques were used to allocate the purchase price of acquired property between land  buildings and improvements  equipment  debt  liabilities assumed and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities such as amounts related to in place tenant leases  acquired above and below market tenant and ground leases and tenant relationships 
after acquisition accounting is applied  the real estate assets are carried at the cost basis less accumulated depreciation 
real estate taxes and interest costs incurred during development periods are capitalized 
capitalized interest costs are based on qualified expenditures and interest rates in place during the development period 
capitalized real estate taxes and interest costs are amortized over lives which are consistent with the developed assets 
pre development costs  which generally include legal and professional fees and other directly related third party costs  are capitalized as part of the property being developed 
in the event a development is no longer deemed to be probable  the costs previously capitalized are expensed 
tenant improvements  either paid directly or in the form of construction allowances paid to tenants  are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life or applicable lease term 
maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense when incurred 
expenditures for significant betterments and improvements are capitalized 
in leasing tenant space  we may provide funding to the lessee through a tenant allowance 
depreciation or amortization expense is computed using the straight line method based upon the following estimated useful lives years buildings and improvements equipment and fixtures tenant improvements shorter of useful life or applicable lease term impairment operating properties  intangible assets and developments in progress we review our real estate assets  including operating properties and developments in progress  for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators are assessed separately for each property and include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in real estate property net operating income  significant occupancy percentage changes  debt maturities and management intent with respect to the assets 
impairment indicators for pre development costs  which are typically costs incurred during the beginning stages of a potential development  and developments in progress are assessed by project and include  but are not limited to  significant changes in projected completion dates  revenues or cash flows  development costs  market factors and sustainability of development projects 
if an indicator of potential impairment exists  the asset is tested for recoverability by comparing its carrying amount to the estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows 
a real estate asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying amount cannot be recovered through estimated future 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows 
to the extent an impairment provision is necessary  the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value is expensed to operations 
in addition  the impairment is allocated proportionately to adjust the carrying amount of the asset 
the adjusted carrying amount  which represents the new cost basis of the asset  is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
recoverable amounts of receivables we make periodic assessments of the collectibility of receivables including those resulting from the difference between rental revenue recognized and rents currently due from tenants based on a specific review of the risk of loss on specific accounts or amounts 
the receivable analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts and considers the nature and age of the receivables  the payment history and financial condition of the payee  the basis for any disputes or negotiations with the payee and other information which may impact collectibility 
for straight line rents receivable  the analysis considers the probability of collection of the unbilled deferred rent receivable given our experience regarding such amounts 
the resulting estimates of any allowance or reserve related to the recovery of these items are subject to revision as these factors change and are sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on such payees 
capitalization of development and leasing costs we capitalize the costs of development and leasing activities of our properties 
the amount of capitalization depends  in part  on the identification and justifiable allocation of certain activities to specific projects and leases 
differences in methodologies of cost identification and documentation  as well as differing assumptions as to the time incurred on projects  can yield significant differences in the amounts capitalized and  as a result  the amount of depreciation recognized 
revenue recognition and related matters minimum rent revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
minimum rent revenues also include amounts collected from tenants to allow the termination of their leases prior to their scheduled termination dates and accretion related to above and below market tenant leases on acquired properties 
straight line rents receivable represents the current net cumulative rents recognized prior to when billed and collectible as provided by the terms of the leases 
overage rent is recognized on an accrual basis once tenant sales exceed contractual tenant lease thresholds 
recoveries from tenants are established in the leases or computed based upon a formula related to real estate taxes  insurance and other shopping center operating expenses and are generally recognized as revenues in the period the related costs are incurred 
economy and inflation substantially all of our tenant leases contain provisions designed to partially mitigate the negative impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive overage rent based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
in addition  many of the leases expire each year which may enable us to replace or renew such expiring leases with new leases at higher rents 
finally  many of the existing leases require the tenants to pay amounts related to all  or substantially all  of their share of certain operating expenses  including cam  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby partially reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in general  these amounts either vary annually based on actual expenditures or are set on an initial share of costs with provisions for annual increases 
inflation also poses a risk to us due to the probability of future increases in interest rates 
such increases would adversely impact us due to our outstanding variable rate debt 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates both in terms of variable rate debt and the cost of new fixed rate debt upon maturity of existing debt 
as of december   we had consolidated debt of billion  including million of variable rate debt 
a basis point movement in the interest rate on the variable rate debt would result in a million annualized increase or decrease in consolidated interest expense and operating cash flows
