item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview and trends lumber liquidators is the largest specialty retailer of hardwood flooring in north america 
we believe we have achieved a reputation for offering great value  superior service and a broad selection of high quality hardwood flooring products 
we offer an extensive selection of premium hardwood flooring products under multiple proprietary brands at low prices designed to appeal to a diverse customer base 
we believe that our vertically integrated business model enables us to offer a broad assortment of high quality products to our customers at a lower cost than our competitors 
at december   we sold our products through lumber liquidators stores in states in the us and in canada  a call center  websites and catalogs 
in  we implemented  or continued the implementation of  certain key  multi year strategic initiatives to enhance our value proposition to the customer and improve our operating margin  including broadening the reach and frequency of our advertising to increase the recognition of our value proposition and ultimately the number of customers served 
in comparing to  we increased our advertising spend by million  or  and total net sales increased million  or 
though our primary focus remains on the more passionate diy customer  we believe our value proposition is reaching  and resonating with  a more casual consumer 
in  the total number of customers invoiced in our stores increased over  and in our comparable stores  increased 
gross margin expansion through continued execution of our sourcing initiatives and optimization of our supply chain 
we are committed to reducing the net cost of product while we broaden our assortment  strengthen availability and increase the attachment rates of moldings and accessories  including flooring tools 
in comparing to  gross margin improved basis points 
we introduced over new floors in  primarily premium selections with gross margins higher than our average 
within our sales mix  moldings and accessories increased basis points over to represent of net sales 
continuous improvement in our operations by developing the best people to serve our customers or to serve those who do 
in  we strengthened the retail expertise across the company through a combination of expanded training and reward programs 
our focus remained on a commitment to excellence and a one team culture 
we believe this focus led to more efficient and effective operations  facilitating incremental net sales  higher gross margin and selling  general and administrative sg a expense leverage 
in  exclusive of certain management bonuses  sg a expenses were basis points lower as a percentage of net sales than in total operating margin increased basis points to 
in  we will continue to reinvest a portion of the benefits from these multi year initiatives into the growth of our core business  driving annual operating income increases 
we expect to aggressively broaden the reach and frequency of our advertising  and as a result  that expense may increase proportionate to  or even greater than  the net sales increase 
we also intend to continue to implement both our sourcing initiatives and efforts to optimize our supply chain in together  we believe gross margin will continue to expand in the future  though the incremental increase in is likely to be less than the increase in our culture is focused on identifying and rewarding superior performance 
in  we will adjust certain management bonuses and equity awards to strengthen retention of our best people and better align their efforts with the long term growth of operating income 
we believe the continued focus on increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations will continue to drive operating margin expansion in the future  though the incremental increase in is likely to be less than the increase in we operate primarily in the highly fragmented wood flooring market for existing homeowners 
this market is dependent on home related  large ticket discretionary spending  which is influenced by a number of complex economic and demographic factors that may vary locally  regionally and nationally 
in  a number of these factors stabilized or improved  though remain at historically low levels 
we believe our customer will remain cautious and price sensitive in  with a number of macroeconomic risks providing uncertainty  and potentially volatile demand  even as a multi year recovery in home remodeling may be forming 

table of contents in  we completed the initial design of an expanded store showroom to enhance the shopping experience for our customers 
we refer to this showroom  coupled with an improved store warehouse design  as our store of the future 
we expect a store of the future showroom to average  square feet versus the  to  square feet previously targeted  yet with a more efficient warehouse and inventory plan to allow the targeted total location to remain at  to  square feet 
the assortment of flooring options presented will expand  grouped by product category  displayed within color palate and in a good better best format 
the assortment of accessories displayed will expand dramatically 
in  we expect our to new store locations to be store of the future format  though the majority of the new locations will open after may st 
we expect capital expenditures of approximately  for each new store location  and merchandise inventory levels carried in the store to increase approximately 
in addition to the new stores  we expect to remodel to existing stores  either in their current location or relocated within the primary trade area 
expansion of our store base continues to be an important driver of our growth  and we now believe the us market will support at least store locations 
in determining this location count  we coordinated efforts with certain third party experts in considering available market share  demographic drivers and certain store level  or four wall  economics 
we expect the success of our multi year strategic initiatives to continue to benefit key four wall financial metrics  including operating income and return on invested capital 
in addition  we believe our market  and therefore  our available share  will expand over the next three to five years 
we expect four wall financial metrics similar to our historical store model  adjusted for market size 
in february of  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock  and in november of  authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million 
this stock repurchase program marks an important step in returning value to our shareholders  and expresses confidence in our proven store model 
through december   we had repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock through open market purchases  using approximately million in cash 
results of operations net sales year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales percentage increase number of stores open at end of period number of stores opened in period percentage increase decrease average sale average retail price per unit sold comparable stores net sales customers invoiced net sales of stores operating for to months net sales of stores operating for more than months net sales in markets with all stores comparable no cannibalization net sales in cannibalized markets average sale  calculated on a total company basis  is defined as the average invoiced sale per customer  measured on a monthly basis and excluding transactions of less than which are generally sample orders  or add ons or fill ins to previous orders and of more than  which are usually contractor orders average retail price per unit sold is calculated on a total company basis and excludes certain service revenue  which consists primarily of freight charges for in home delivery a store is generally considered comparable on the first day of the thirteenth full calendar month after opening approximated by applying our average sale to total net sales at comparable stores a cannibalized market has at least one comparable store and one non comparable store 
table of contents net sales for increased million  or  over as net sales in comparable stores increased million and net sales in non comparable stores increased million 
net sales for increased million  or  over due to an increase of million in non comparable store net sales which was offset by a million decrease in comparable store net sales 
net sales in comparable stores increased comparing to driven by an increase in the number of customers invoiced and a increase in the average sale 
comparing to  the decrease in net sales at comparable stores resulted from a decrease in the number of customers invoiced  offset by a increase in the average sale 
the average sale over the past two years has benefited from an increase in the average retail price per unit sold 
in comparing to  the average sale also benefited from an increase in the volume of units sold  reversing a decrease in comparing to key drivers of retail price and volume include the sales mix of moldings and accessories  which increased to of total net sales in from in and in moldings and accessories generally increase both the volume of units sold and the average retail price per unit sold 
changes in the sales mix of flooring products and the total square footage of the project 
in both and  customer preference for premium products increased  particularly within certain product categories including laminates  engineered hardwood  bamboo  cork and resilient 
the number of customers invoiced in comparable stores has benefited from greater recognition of our value proposition due to our efforts to expand our advertising reach and frequency  which we began in the fourth quarter of fewer non comparable stores operating in existing markets 
at december   we were operating non comparable stores in markets which included at least one comparable store  down from stores at december  and stores at december  a greater number of stores in operation for to months  or the first two years as a comparable store  when increases in net sales are generally higher than average due primarily to greater brand awareness in the market 
in  particularly in the first half of the year  we believe the number of customers invoiced decreased in comparison to due to our reduced productivity in serving customer demand and greater consumer caution with regard to large ticket  discretionary purchases 
new store locations continue to positively impact our net sales growth 
we opened new locations in  with approximately two thirds of these locations in existing markets 
in  we opened new locations in an equal split of new and existing markets 
due to the opening schedule of new store locations over the previous months  the average non comparable store operating in was more mature  as measured in months of operation  than the average non comparable store operating in  which approximated our historical average 
in canada  we had nine stores operating at december   up from seven at december  gross profit and gross margin year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit gross margin 
table of contents we believe that the significant drivers of gross margin expansion and their estimated impact compared to the prior year are as follows year ended december  driver description expansion contraction in basis points cost of product cost of acquiring the products we sell from our suppliers  including the impact of our sourcing initiatives  changes in the mix of products sold  changes in the average retail price per unit sold 
transportation international and domestic transportation costs  including the impact of international container rates  customs and duty charges  fuel and fuel surcharges  impact of mill shipments received directly by our stores  transportation charges from our distribution centers to our stores  transportation charges between stores and the cost of delivery to our customers 
all other investments in our quality control procedures  warranty costs  changes in finishing costs to produce a unit of our proprietary brands  inventory shrink  net costs of producing samples 
total change in gross margin from the prior year certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
cost of product in both and  gross margin benefited from our sourcing initiatives and shifts in our sales mix 
our sourcing initiatives  originally launched in the first quarter of  include vendor allowances  line reviews and increases in the percentage of product we source direct from the mill 
shifts in our sales mix benefiting gross margin in both and included increases in moldings and accessories  and increases in certain premium products  particularly in merchandise categories with a lower than average retail price point 
in september  we entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of sequoia floorings inc sequoia relating to sequoia s quality control and assurance  product development  claims management and logistics operations in china 
we believe our cost of product was reduced  primarily in  due to both the net cost reduction of owning those services and the benefits of working directly with the mills 
transportation gross margin benefited from initiatives launched in to enhance the efficiency of supply chain operations  including line reviews of significant contracts  strengthening the reliability of distribution from warehouse to store  and enhanced control over transfer and delivery costs 
these benefits  which we expect to grow in  were partially offset by generally higher inbound transportation costs capitalized into our unit cost and an increase in the average cost per domestic mile 
in addition  of our unit purchases in were received directly at our stores from either a mill or our chinese consolidation center  compared to in and in net transportation costs are generally lower when product is received directly by our stores 
all other costs in  we increased our investment in quality control  particularly in south america  and in levered and reduced the net cost of those services 
procedural discipline and enhanced coordination throughout the supply chain resulted in a reduction of unrecorded inventory shrink 
partially offsetting these benefits  greater turn within our assortment and generally higher carrying levels of inventory resulted in an increase in the reserve for obsolescence and shrink 

table of contents operating income and operating margin year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit sg a expenses operating income operating margin the following table sets forth components of our sg a expenses for the periods indicated  as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  total sg a expenses salaries  commissions and benefits advertising occupancy depreciation and amortization stock based compensation other sg a expenses operating income for increased million over as the million increase in gross profit was partially offset by a million increase in sg a expenses 
operating income for increased million over as the million increase in gross profit was almost fully offset by a million increase in sg a expenses 
the increase in sg a expenses included the following salaries  commissions and benefits increased in primarily due to significantly higher accruals for our management bonus plan  an increase in certain benefit costs and higher commission rates earned by our store management 
salaries  commissions and benefits increased in primarily due to the growth in our store base and higher total benefit costs 
advertising expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales in both and as we continued to both leverage our national advertising campaigns over a larger store base and reallocate our advertising to more effective media channels 
partially offsetting this benefit was increased spending to broaden our reach and frequency  beginning primarily in the fourth quarter of occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of net sales in primarily due to higher net sales  partially offset by store base expansion 
in  occupancy costs included expansion of both our store base and distribution network  including canada 
other sg a expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales in primarily due to higher net sales and increased reimbursements from our primary installation partner  partially offset by higher bankcard discount rates related to certain extended term promotional programs and the accrual of approximately million related to a legal matter 
in  the benefit of higher net sales was matched by the combined increase in professional fees  primarily related to our integrated information technology solution  and an increase in bankcard discount fees  also for extended term promotional programs 
provision for income taxes year ended december  dollars in thousands provision for income taxes effective tax rate the increase in the effective tax rate is due to a million valuation allowance recorded in the fourth quarter 
our canadian operations  which included the first stores opening in march  had produced a cumulative net loss 
table of contents through management determined that the positive evidence supporting future realization of the deferred tax asset was outweighed by the more objectively verifiable negative evidence  and a full valuation allowance was recorded 
during  canadian operations were profitable on an aggregate store four wall basis  but that profitability was more than offset by the cost of management  infrastructure and administrative support 
in  continued maturity of the canadian store base  and changes in both management and infrastructure  are expected to result in profitable operations  where net operating loss carryforwards may be utilized to offset taxable income 
absent the valuation allowance  the effective tax rate for would have approximated 
the effective tax rate increase in comparing to is primarily due to foreign taxes and certain non deductible expenses related to the sequoia acquisition 
net income year ended december  dollars in thousands net income as a percentage of net sales net income for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december   and remained flat comparing to liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity and capital requirements are for capital expenditures to maintain and grow our business  working capital and general corporate purposes 
in addition  we periodically use available funds to repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program  with approximately million remaining under our authorization of million 
our principal sources of liquidity are million of cash and cash equivalents at december   our cash flow from operations  and million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with our existing liquidity sources  will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
in  we expect capital expenditures to total between million and million 
in addition to general capital requirements  we intend to open between and new store locations  remodel or relocate to existing stores  continue to invest in integrated information technology systems  invest in our supply chain initiatives  and continue to improve the effectiveness of our marketing programs 
cash and cash equivalents in  cash and cash equivalents increased million to million 
the increase of cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to million of net cash provided by operating activities and million of proceeds received from stock option exercises which was partially offset by the use of million to repurchase common stock and million for capital expenditures 
in  cash and cash equivalents increased million to million as million of cash provided by operating activities and million of proceeds received from stock option exercises were partially offset by the use of million for capital expenditures and million to acquire certain assets of sequoia 
in  cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million primarily due to the use of million for capital expenditures which was partially offset by million in cash provided by operating activities and million of proceeds received from stock option exercises 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventory is our most significant asset  and is considered either available for sale or inbound in transit  based on whether we have physically received and inspected the products at an individual store location  in our distribution centers or in another facility where we control and monitor inspection 

table of contents merchandise inventories and available inventory per store in operation on december were as follows in thousands inventory available for sale inventory inbound in transit total merchandise inventories available inventory per store available inventory per store at december  was within our targeted range of  to  significantly higher than at december   which had been impacted by our sourcing initiatives and certain related fourth quarter steps to optimize inventory levels 
during  we expect seasonal builds in available inventory per store to increase our range to a high of  however  we expect to end the year between  and  inbound in transit inventory generally varies due to the timing of certain international shipments  but may also be influenced by seasonal factors  including international holidays  rainy seasons and specific merchandise category planning 
we planned for an earlier spring build in of certain products primarily supplied by asian mills  thereby increasing the inbound in transit inventory at december  cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  million for and million for the million increase in net cash comparing to is primarily due to more profitable operations which were partially offset by a larger build in merchandise inventories net of the change in accounts payable 
the million increase in net cash comparing to is due primarily to a reduction in merchandise inventories net of the change in accounts payable  customer deposits and store credits and certain other working capital items 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for  million for and million for net cash used in investing activities in each year included capital purchases of store fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements for stores opened  relocated or remodeled  investment in certain equipment including our finishing line and forklifts  capital purchases related to our integrated information technology solution  routine capital purchases of computer hardware and software  and certain leasehold improvements in our corporate headquarters 
in  net cash used in investing activities included million of cash paid for the sequoia acquisition 
financing activities 
net cash used by financing activities was million in primarily due to the use of million to repurchase common stock  which was partially offset by proceeds received from stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in and  respectively  primarily due to proceeds received from stock option exercises 
revolving credit agreement a revolving credit agreement the revolver providing for borrowings up to million is available to us through expiration on february  during  and  we did not borrow against the revolver and at december  and  there were no outstanding commitments under letters of credit 
the revolver is primarily available to fund inventory purchases  including the support of up to million for letters of credit  and for general operations 
the revolver is secured by our inventory  has no mandated payment provisions and we pay a fee of per annum  subject to adjustment based on certain financial performance criteria  on any unused portion of the revolver 
amounts outstanding under the revolver would be subject to an interest rate of libor plus  subject to adjustment based on certain financial performance criteria 
the revolver has certain defined covenants and restrictions  including the maintenance of certain defined financial ratios 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants at december  related party transactions see the discussion of related party transactions in note and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and within certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence in item of this report 

table of contents contractual commitments and contingencies our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  are summarized in the following table payments due by period total less than year to years to years years in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations included in this table is the base period or current renewal period for our operating leases 
the operating leases generally contain varying renewal provisions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or other financing activities with special purpose entities 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both significant and that require us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experiences and various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and we might obtain different estimates if we used different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements recognition of net sales we recognize net sales for products purchased at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
we recognize service revenue  which consists primarily of freight charges for in home delivery  when the service has been rendered 
we report revenue net of sales and use taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental taxing authorities 
net sales are reduced by an allowance for anticipated sales returns that we estimate based on historical sales trends and experience 
we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns 
any reasonably likely changes that may occur in the assumptions underlying our allowance estimates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance 
actual sales returns did not vary materially from estimated amounts for  or in addition  customers who do not take immediate delivery of their purchases are generally required to leave a deposit of up to of the retail sales amount with the balance payable when the products are delivered 
these customer deposits benefit our cash flow and return on investment capital  because we receive partial payment for our customers purchases immediately 
we record these deposits as a liability on our balance sheet under the line item customer deposits and store credits until the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
merchandise inventories we value our merchandise inventories at the lower of merchandise cost or market value 
we determine merchandise cost using the average cost method 
all of the hardwood flooring we purchase from suppliers is either prefinished or unfinished  and in immediate saleable form 
to the extent that we finish and box unfinished products  we include those costs 
table of contents in the average unit cost of related merchandise inventory 
in determining market value  we make judgments and estimates as to the market value of our products  based on factors such as historical results and current sales trends 
any reasonably likely changes that may occur in those assumptions in the future may require us to record charges for losses or obsolescence against these assets  but would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance 
actual losses and obsolescence charges did not vary materially from estimated amounts for  or stock based compensation we currently maintain a single equity incentive plan under which we may grant non qualified stock options  restricted shares  stock appreciation rights and other equity awards to employees and non employee directors 
we recognize expense for our stock based compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted 
measured compensation cost is recognized ratably over the service period of the related stock based compensation award 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes merton valuation model 
in order to determine the related stock based compensation expense  we used the following assumptions for stock options granted during expected life of years to years  expected stock price volatility of  risk free interest rates from to  and dividends are not expected to be paid in any year 
the expected stock price volatility range is based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock price and the historical volatilities of companies included in a peer group that was selected by management whose shares or options are publicly available 
the volatilities are estimated for a period of time equal to the expected term of the related option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield of us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
the expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is determined by considering the contractual terms  vesting schedule and expectations of future employee behavior 
had we arrived at different assumptions of stock price volatility or expected terms of our options  our stock based compensation expense and result of operations could have been different 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued guidance that revises the requirements around how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the guidance allows companies to perform a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount  a quantitative calculation would not be needed 
we adopted this guidance for our fiscal annual goodwill impairment test 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through the investment of our cash and cash equivalents 
we invest our cash in short term investments with maturities of three months or less 
changes in interest rates affect the interest income we earn  and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  any future borrowings under our revolving credit agreement would be exposed to interest rate risk due to the variable rate of the facility 
we currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future 
however  in the future  in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks  we may at times enter into derivative financial instruments  although we have not historically done so 
we do not  and do not intend to  engage in the practice of trading derivative securities for profit 
exchange rate risk 
the majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the us  we have transactions in or exposure to other currencies  including the euro  canadian dollar  chinese yuan and brazilian real 

table of contents we currently do not engage in any exchange rate hedging activity and currently have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future 
however  in the future  in an effort to mitigate losses associated with these risks  we may at times engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues  inventory purchases  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
