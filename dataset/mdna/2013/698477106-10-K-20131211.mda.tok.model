item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competitive business conditions the oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive  particularly in the search for new oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
many factors affect panhandle s competitive position and the market for its products  which are beyond its control 
some of these factors include the quantity and price of foreign oil imports  domestic supply of oil  ngl and natural gas  changes in prices received for oil  ngl and natural gas production  business and consumer demand for refined oil products  ngl and natural gas  and the effects of federal and state regulation of the exploration for  production of and sales of oil  ngl and natural gas 
changes in existing economic conditions  political developments  weather patterns and actions taken by opec and other oil producing countries have a dramatic influence on the price panhandle receives for its oil  ngl and natural gas production 
the company does not operate any of the wells in which it has an interest  rather it relies on companies with greater resources  staff  equipment  research and experience for operation of wells both in the drilling and production phases 
the company s business strategy is to use its strong financial base and its mineral and leasehold acreage ownership  coupled with its own geologic and economic evaluations  either to elect to participate in drilling operations with these larger companies or to lease or farmout its mineral or leasehold acreage while retaining a royalty interest 
this strategy allows the company to compete effectively in drilling operations it could not undertake on its own due to financial and personnel limitations while maintaining low overhead costs 
sources and availability of raw materials the existence of recoverable oil  ngl and natural gas reserves in commercial quantities is essential to the ultimate realization of value from the company s mineral and leasehold acreage 
these mineral and leasehold properties are essentially the raw materials to our business 
the production and sale of oil  ngl and natural gas from the company s properties are essential to provide the cash flow necessary to sustain the ongoing viability of the company 
the company reinvests a portion of its cash flow to purchase oil and natural gas mineral and leasehold acreage to assure the continued availability of acreage with which to participate in exploration and development drilling operations and  subsequently  the production and sale of oil  ngl and natural gas 
this participation in exploration  development and production activities and purchase of additional acreage is necessary to continue to supply the company with the raw materials with which to generate additional cash flow 
mineral and leasehold acreage purchases are made from many owners 
the company does not rely on any particular companies or persons for the purchases of additional mineral and leasehold acreage 
major customers the company s oil  ngl and natural gas production is sold  in most cases  through its well operators to many different purchasers on a well by well basis 
during  sales through two separate well operators accounted for approximately and of the company s total oil  ngl and natural gas sales 
during  sales through three separate well operators accounted for approximately  and of the company s total oil  ngl and natural gas sales 
during  sales through two separate well operators accounted for approximately and of the company s total oil  ngl and natural gas sales 
generally  if one purchaser declines to continue purchasing the company s production  several other purchasers can be located 
pricing is generally consistent from purchaser to purchaser 
patents  trademarks  licenses  franchises and royalty agreements the company does not own any patents  trademarks  licenses or franchises 
royalty agreements on wells producing oil  ngl and natural gas stemming from the company s ownership of mineral acreage generate a portion of the company s revenues 
these royalties are tied to ownership of mineral acreage  and this ownership is perpetual  unless sold by the company 
royalties are due and payable to the company whenever oil  ngl or natural gas is produced and sold from wells located on the company s mineral acreage 
regulation all of the company s well interests and non producing properties are located onshore in the united states 
oil  ngl and natural gas production is subject to various taxes  such as gross production taxes and  in some cases  ad valorem taxes 
the state of oklahoma and other states require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations and impose other regulations relating to the exploration for and production of oil  ngl and natural gas 
these states also have regulations addressing conservation matters  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties and the regulation of spacing  plugging and abandonment of wells 
these regulations vary from state to state 
as previously discussed  the company relies on its well operators to comply with governmental regulations 
various aspects of the company s oil and natural gas operations are regulated by agencies of the federal government 
transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce is generally regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc pursuant to the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of ngpa 
the intrastate transportation and gathering of natural gas and operational and safety matters related thereto may be subject to regulation by state and local governments 
ferc s jurisdiction over interstate natural gas sales was substantially modified by the ngpa under which ferc continued to regulate the maximum selling prices of certain categories of natural gas sold in first sales in interstate and intrastate commerce 
effective january   however  the natural gas wellhead decontrol act the decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas 
because first sales include typical wellhead sales by producers  all natural gas produced from the company s natural gas properties is sold at market prices  subject to the terms of any private contracts in effect 
ferc s jurisdiction over natural gas transportation was not affected by the decontrol act 
sales of natural gas are affected by intrastate and interstate natural gas transportation regulation 
beginning in  ferc adopted regulatory changes that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas 
ferc intended these changes to foster competition by transforming the role of interstate pipeline companies from wholesale marketers of natural gas to the primary role of natural gas transporters 
as a result of the various omnibus rulemaking proceedings in the late s and the individual pipeline restructuring proceedings of the early to mid s  interstate pipelines must provide open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportation related services to all producers  natural gas marketing companies  local distribution companies  industrial end users and other customers seeking service 
through similar orders affecting intrastate pipelines that provide similar interstate services  ferc expanded the impact of open access regulations to intrastate commerce 
ferc has pursued other policy initiatives that have affected natural gas marketing 
most notable are permitting the large scale divestiture of interstate pipeline owned natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or non affiliated companies  further development of rules governing the relationship of the pipelines with their marketing affiliates  the publication of standards relating to the use of electronic bulletin boards and electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis  further review of the role of the secondary market for released pipeline capacity and its relationship to open access service in the primary market  and development of policy and promulgation of orders pertaining to its authorization of market based rates rather than traditional cost of service based rates for transportation or transportation related services upon the pipeline s demonstration of lack of market control in the relevant service market 
as a result of these changes  sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to the particular pipeline services they need and are able to conduct business with a larger number of counter parties 
these changes generally have improved the access to markets for natural gas while substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace 
the effect of future regulations by ferc and other regulatory agencies cannot be predicted 
sales of oil are not regulated and are made at market prices 
the price received from the sale of oil is affected by the cost of transporting it to market 
much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines 
effective january   ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
over time  these regulations tend to increase the cost of transporting oil by interstate pipelines  although some annual adjustments may result in decreased rates for a given year 
these regulations have generally been upheld on judicial review 
every five years  ferc will examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced by the oil pipeline industry 
environmental matters as the company is directly involved in the extraction and use of natural resources  it is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental and ecological matters 
compliance with these laws and regulations may necessitate significant capital outlays  however  to date  the company s cost of compliance has been immaterial 
the company does not believe the existence of these environmental laws  as currently written and interpreted  will materially hinder or adversely affect the company s business operations  however  there can be no assurances of future events or changes in laws  or the interpretation of laws  governing our industry 
current discussions involving the governance of hydraulic fracturing in the future could have a material impact on the company 
since the company does not operate any wells in which it owns an interest  actual compliance with environmental laws is controlled by the well operators  with panhandle being responsible for its proportionate share of the costs involved 
as such  to its knowledge  the company is not aware of any instances of non compliance with existing laws and regulations 
absent an extraordinary event  any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
although the company is not fully insured against all environmental risks  insurance coverage is maintained at levels which are customary in the industry 
employees at september   panhandle employed people with five of the employees serving as executive officers 
the president and ceo is also a director of the company 
item arisk factors in addition to the other information included in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered in evaluating the company s business and future prospects 
if any of the following risk factors should occur  the company s financial condition could be materially impacted and the holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in panhandle 
the risk factors described below are not exhaustive  and investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to the company and its business 
investors should also read the other information in this form k  including the financial statements and related notes 
uncertainty of economic conditions  worldwide and in the united states  may have a significant negative effect on operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
effects of change in domestic and international economic conditions could include a decline in demand for oil  ngl and natural gas resulting in decreased oil  ngl and natural gas reserves due to curtailed drilling activity  a decline in oil  ngl and natural gas prices  risk of insolvency of well operators and oil  ngl and natural gas purchasers  limited availability of certain insurance coverage  limited access to derivative instruments  and limited credit availability 
a decline in reserves would lead to a decline in production  and either a production decline  or a decrease in oil  ngl and natural gas prices  would have a negative impact on the company s cash flow  profitability and value 
oil  ngl and natural gas prices are volatile 
volatility in these prices can adversely affect operating results and the price of the company s common stock 
this volatility also makes valuation of oil and natural gas producing properties difficult and can disrupt markets 
the supply of and demand for oil  ngl and natural gas impact the prices we realize on the sale of these commodities and  in turn  materially affect the company s financial results 
oil  ngl and natural gas prices have historically been  and will likely continue to be  volatile 
the prices for oil  ngl and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuation in response to a number of factors  including worldwide economic conditions economic  political  regulatory and tax developments market uncertainty changes in the supply of and demand for oil  ngl and natural gas availability and capacity of necessary transportation and processing facilities commodity futures trading regional price differentials differing quality of oil produced ie  sweet crude versus heavy or sour crude differing quality and ngl content of natural gas produced weather conditions the level of imports and exports of oil  ngl and natural gas political instability or armed conflicts in major oil and natural gas producing regions actions taken by opec competition from alternative sources of energy technological advancements affecting energy consumption and energy supply price volatility makes it difficult to budget and project the return on investment in exploration and development projects and to estimate with precision the value of producing properties that are owned or acquired by the company 
in addition  volatile prices often disrupt the market for oil and natural gas properties  as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties 
revenues  results of operations  reserves and capital availability may fluctuate significantly as a result of variations in oil  ngl and natural gas prices and production performance 
lower oil  ngl and natural gas prices may also trigger significant impairment write downs on a portion of the company s properties and negatively affect the company s results of operations and its ability to borrow under its credit facility 
a substantial decline in oil  ngl and natural gas prices for a prolonged period of time would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s financial position  results of operations  access to capital and the quantities of oil  ngl and natural gas that may be economically produced would be negatively impacted if oil  ngl and natural gas prices decrease significantly for an extended period of time 
the ways in which such price decreases could have a material negative effect include cash flow would be reduced  decreasing funds available for capital expenditures employed to replace reserves and maintain or increase production future undiscounted and discounted net cash flows from producing properties would decrease  possibly resulting in impairment expense that may be significant certain reserves may no longer be economic to produce  leading to lower proved reserves  production and cash flow access to sources of capital  such as equity or long term debt markets  could be severely limited or unavailable the company cannot control activities on properties it does not operate 
the company does not operate any of the properties in which it has an interest and has very limited ability to exercise influence over the third party operators of these properties 
our dependence on the third party operators of our properties  and on the cooperation of other working interest owners in these properties  could negatively affect the following the company s return on capital used in drilling or property acquisition the company s production and reserve growth rates capital required to drill and complete wells success and timing of drilling  development and exploitation activities on the company s properties compliance with environmental  safety and other regulations lease operating expenses plugging and abandonment costs  including well site restorations dependency on each operator s judgment  expertise and financial resources could result in unexpected future costs  lost revenues and or capital restrictions to the extent they would cumulatively have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company s derivative activities may reduce the cash flow received for oil and natural gas sales 
in order to manage exposure to price volatility on our oil and natural gas production  we enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts for a portion of our expected production 
oil and natural gas price derivatives may limit the cash flow we actually realize and therefore reduce the company s ability to fund future projects 
none of our oil and natural gas price derivative contracts are designated as hedges for accounting purposes  therefore  we record all derivative contracts at fair value on our balance sheet 
accordingly  these fair values may vary significantly from period to period  materially affecting reported earnings 
the fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative instruments outstanding as of september   was a net asset of there is risk associated with our derivative contracts that involves the possibility that counterparties may be unable to satisfy contractual obligations to us 
if any counterparty to our derivative instruments were to default or seek bankruptcy protection  it could subject a larger percentage of our future oil and natural gas production to commodity price changes and could have a negative effect on our ability to fund future projects 
there are also risks of financial loss associated with derivative instruments if there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price of the derivative contract and the actual received price 
a more thorough discussion of these derivative contracts  including risk of financial loss  is contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
lower oil  ngl and natural gas prices or negative adjustments to oil  ngl and natural gas reserves may result in significant impairment charges 
the company has elected to utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and natural gas exploration and development activities 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical costs  rentals and exploratory dry holes  are charged against income as incurred 
costs of successful wells and related production equipment and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized by property using the unit of production method the ratio of oil  ngl and natural gas volumes produced to total proved or proved developed reserves as oil  ngl and natural gas are produced 
all long lived assets  principally the company s oil and natural gas properties  are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset on our books may be greater than its future net cash flows 
the need to test a property for impairment may result from declines in oil  ngl and natural gas sales prices or unfavorable adjustments to oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
also  once assets are classified as held for sale  they are reviewed for impairment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  the company cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded 
if an impairment charge is recognized  cash flow from operating activities is not impacted  but net income and  consequently  shareholders equity are reduced 
in periods when impairment charges are incurred  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate 
any inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
it is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil  ngl and natural gas with precision 
oil  ngl and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil  ngl and natural gas using assumptions concerning future prices of these commodities  future production levels  and operating and development costs 
in estimating our reserves  we and our independent consulting petroleum engineering firm make various assumptions with respect to many subject matters that may prove to be incorrect  including future oil  ngl and natural gas prices production rates reservoir pressures  decline rates  drainage areas and reservoir limits interpretation of subsurface conditions including geological and geophysical data potential for water encroachment or mechanical failures levels and timing of capital expenditures  lease operating expenses  production taxes and income taxes  and availability of funds for such expenditures effects of government regulation if these assumptions prove to be incorrect  our estimates of reserves  the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and our estimates of the future net cash flows from our reserves could change significantly 
our standardized measure of oil and natural gas reserves is calculated using the month average price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month individual product prices for each month within the month period prior to september held flat over the life of the properties and operating costs in effect as of the date of estimation  less future estimated development  production and income tax expenses  and is discounted at per annum to reflect the timing of future net revenue in accordance with the rules and regulations of the sec 
over time  we may make material changes to reserve estimates to take into account changes in our assumptions and the results of actual development and production 
the reserve estimates made for fields that do not have a lengthy production history are less reliable than estimates for fields with lengthy production histories 
a lack of production history may contribute to inaccuracy in our estimates of proved reserves  future production rates and the timing of development expenditures 
further  our lack of knowledge of all individual well information known to the well operators such as incomplete well stimulation efforts  restricted production rates for various reasons and up to date well production data  etc 
may cause differences in our reserve estimates 
because pud s  under sec reporting rules  may only be recorded if the wells they relate to are scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of recording  the removal of pud s that are not developed within this five year period may be required 
removals of this nature may significantly reduce the quantity and present value of the company s oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
because forward looking prices and costs are not used to estimate discounted future net cash flows from our estimated proved reserves  the standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of our properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor used when calculating discounted future net cash flows in compliance with the fasb statement on oil and natural gas producing activities disclosures may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the company  or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
failure to find or acquire additional reserves will cause reserves and production to decline materially from their current levels 
the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted 
the company s proved reserves will decline materially as reserves are produced except to the extent that the company acquires additional properties containing proved reserves  conducts additional successful exploration and development drilling  successfully applies new technologies or identifies additional behind pipe zones different productive zones within existing producing well bores or secondary recovery reserves 
drilling for oil and natural gas invariably involves unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells  but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling  operating and other costs 
in addition  wells that are profitable may not achieve a targeted rate of return 
the company relies on third party operators interpretation of seismic data and other advanced technologies in identifying prospects and in conducting exploration and development activities 
nevertheless  prior to drilling a well  the seismic data and other technologies used do not allow operators to know conclusively whether oil  ngl or natural gas is present in commercial quantities 
cost factors can adversely affect the economics of any project  and ultimately the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is controlled by well operators and existing market conditions 
further  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors  including unexpected drilling conditions title problems pressure or irregularities in formations equipment failures or accidents fires  explosions  blowouts and surface cratering lack of availability to market production via pipelines or other transportation adverse weather conditions environmental hazards or liabilities governmental regulations cost and availability of drilling rigs  equipment and services expected sales price to be received for oil  ngl or natural gas produced from the wells oil and natural gas drilling and producing operations involve various risks 
the company is subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties  including well blowouts  cratering  explosions and human related accidents mechanical  equipment and pipe failures adverse weather conditions and natural disasters civil disturbances and terrorist activities oil  ngl and natural gas price reductions environmental risks stemming from the use  production  handling and disposal of water  waste materials  hydrocarbons and other substances into the air  soil or water title problems limited availability of financing marketing related infrastructure  transportation and processing limitations regulatory compliance issues as a non operator  we are dependent on third party operators and the contractors they hire for operational safety  environmental safety and compliance with regulations of governmental authorities 
the company maintains insurance against many potential losses or liabilities arising from well operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts believed by management to be prudent 
however  this insurance does not protect the company against all risks 
for example  the company does not maintain insurance for business interruption  acts of war or terrorism 
additionally  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
these risks could give rise to significant uninsured costs that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business condition and financial results 
debt level and interest rates may adversely affect our business 
the company has a credit facility with bank of oklahoma bok which consists of a revolving loan with a limit in the amount of  as of september   the company had a balance of  drawn on the facility 
the facility has a current borrowing base of  is secured by certain of the company s properties and contains certain restrictive covenants 
should the company incur substantial indebtedness under its credit facility to fund capital projects or for other reasons  there is risk of it adversely affecting our business operations as follows cash flows from operating activities required to service indebtedness may not be available for other purposes covenants contained in the company s borrowing agreement may limit our ability to borrow additional funds  pay dividends and make certain investments any limitation on the borrowing of additional funds may affect our ability to fund capital projects and may also affect how we will be able to react to economic and industry changes a significant increase in the interest rate on our credit facility will limit funds available for other purposes changes in prevailing interest rates may affect the company s capability to meet its debt service requirements  as its credit facility bears interest at floating rates the borrowing base of our corporate revolving bank credit facility is subject to periodic redetermination and is based in part on oil  ngl and natural gas prices 
a lowering of our borrowing base because of lower oil  ngl or natural gas prices  or for other reasons  could require us to repay indebtedness in excess of the newly established borrowing base  or we might need to further secure the debt with additional collateral 
our ability to meet any debt obligations depends on our future performance 
general business  economic  financial and product pricing conditions  along with other factors  affect our future performance  and many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants relating to our credit facility could result in a default  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
future legislative or regulatory changes may result in increased costs and decreased revenues  cash flows and liquidity 
companies that operate wells in which panhandle owns a working interest are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation 
panhandle  as a working interest owner  is therefore indirectly subject to these same regulations 
new or changed laws and regulations such as those described below could have a material adverse effect on our business 
federal income taxation proposals to repeal the expensing of intangible drilling costs  repeal the percentage depletion allowance and increase the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses  if enacted  would increase and accelerate the company s payment of federal income taxes 
as a result  these changes would decrease the company s cash flows available for developing its oil and natural gas properties 
hydraulic fracturing the vast majority of oil and natural gas wells drilled in recent years have been  and future wells are expected to be  hydraulically fractured as a part of the process of completing the wells and putting them on production 
this is true of the wells drilled in which the company owns an interest 
hydraulic fracturing is a process that involves pumping water  sand and additives at high pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production 
in developing plays where hydraulic fracturing  which requires large volumes of water  is necessary for successful development  the demand for water may exceed the supply 
a lack of readily available water or a significant increase in the cost of water could cause delays or increased completion costs 
in addition to water  hydraulic fracturing fluid contains chemical additives designed to optimize production 
well operators are being required in certain states to disclose the components of these additives 
additional states and the federal government may follow with similar requirements or may restrict the use of certain additives 
this could result in more costly or less effective development of wells 
efforts to regulate hydraulic fracturing are increasing at the local  state and federal level 
several new regulations are being considered  including limiting water withdrawals and usage  limiting water disposition  restricting which additives may be used  implementing state wide hydraulic fracturing moratoriums and temporary or permanent bans in certain environmentally sensitive areas 
public sentiment against hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production has become more vocal  which could result in more stringent permitting and compliance requirements 
consequences of these actions could potentially increase capital  compliance and operating costs significantly  as well as delay or halt the further development of oil and gas reserves on the company s properties 
any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
climate change studies have suggested that emission of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  may be impacting the earth climate 
methane  a primary component of natural gas  and carbon dioxide  a by product of burning oil and natural gas  are examples of greenhouse gases 
the us congress and various states have been evaluating  and in some cases implementing  climate related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases 
in december  the environmental protection agency epa issued findings that methane and carbon dioxide present a health and safety issue such that they should be regulated under the clean air act 
in november  the epa finalized its greenhouse gas reporting requirements for certain oil and gas production facilities that emit  metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year 
the rule requires annual reporting to the epa of greenhouse gas emissions by such regulated facilities 
on april   the epa issued final rules that established new air emission controls for crude oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations 
the final rules require the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells completed or re fractured after january  these rules may require the installation of new equipment to control emissions and other modifications by the third party operators of wells in which we own an interest 
compliance with such rules could result in significant costs  including increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
these and any further restrictions resulting from federal or state legislation or regulations may have an effect on our ability to produce oil and natural gas  as well as the demand for oil  ngl and natural gas 
such changes may result in additional compliance obligations that could cumulatively have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  financial results and cash flows 
shortages of oilfield equipment  services  qualified personnel and resulting cost increases could adversely affect results of operations 
the demand for qualified and experienced field personnel  geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly  often in correlation with oil  ngl and natural gas prices  resulting in periodic shortages 
when demand for rigs and equipment increases due to an increase in the number of wells being drilled  there have been shortages of drilling rigs  hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel and other oilfield equipment 
higher oil  ngl and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand for  and result in increased prices of  drilling rigs  crews and associated supplies  equipment and services 
these shortages or price increases could negatively affect the ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations by the operators of the company s wells  resulting in an adverse effect on the company s financial condition  cash flow and operating results 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  and most of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do 
we compete in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas acquisition  development  exploration and production 
we face intense competition from both major and independent oil and natural gas companies to acquire desirable producing properties  new properties for future exploration and human resource expertise necessary to effectively develop properties 
we also face similar competition in obtaining sufficient capital to maintain drilling rights in all drilling units 
a substantial number of our competitors have financial and other resources significantly greater than ours and some of them are fully integrated oil and natural gas companies 
these companies are able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and are able to define  evaluate  bid for  purchase and subsequently drill a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit  potentially reducing our ability to participate in drilling on certain of our acreage as a working interest owner 
our ability to develop and exploit our oil and natural gas properties and to acquire additional quality properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully evaluate  select and acquire suitable properties and join in drilling with reputable operators in this highly competitive environment 
significant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves and conduct our business 
the company funds acquisition  exploration  development and production activities primarily through cash flows from operations and  to a lesser extent  borrowings under its credit facility 
the timing and amount of capital necessary to carry out these activities can vary significantly as a result of product price fluctuations  property acquisitions  drilling results and the availability of drilling rigs  equipment  well services and transportation capacity 
cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables  including the company s amount of proved reserves volume of oil  ngl and natural gas produced received prices for oil  ngl and natural gas sold ability to acquire and produce new reserves ability to obtain financing we may have limited ability to obtain the capital required to sustain our operations at current levels if our borrowing base under our credit facility is lowered as a result of decreased revenues  lower product prices  declines in reserves or for other reasons 
failure to sustain operations at current levels could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flow and results of operations 
we may be subject to information technology system failures  network disruptions  cyber attacks or other breaches in data security 
power  telecommunication or other system failures due to hardware or software malfunctions  computer viruses  vandalism  terrorism  natural disasters  fire  human error or by other means could significantly affect the company s ability to conduct its business 
though we have implemented complex network security measures  stringent internal controls and maintain offsite backup of all crucial electronic data  there cannot be absolute assurance that a form of system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations results 
item bunresolved staff comments none item properties at september   panhandle s principal properties consisted of perpetual ownership of  net mineral acres  held principally in arkansas  new mexico  north dakota  oklahoma  texas and six other states  leases on  net acres primarily in oklahoma and working interests  royalty interests or both in  producing oil and natural gas wells and wells in the process of being drilled or completed 
consistent with industry practice  the company does not have current abstracts or title opinions on all of its mineral acreage and  therefore  cannot be certain that it has unencumbered title to all of these properties 
in recent years  a few insignificant challenges have been made against the company s fee title to its acreage

a total of bcfe of the beginning balance were transferred to proved developed producing during the bcfe of negative revisions to pud reserves consist of a positive pricing revision of bcfe offset by a bcfe of the beginning balance negative performance revision in as the result of removal of dry gas reserves which are no longer projected to be developed within years from the date they were added 
a total of bcfe of the beginning balance of pud reserves were moved out of the category during as either the result of being transferred to proved developed or removed because they were no longer projected to be developed within years from the date they were added to the proved undeveloped reserves 
only pud locations from  representing of total pud reserves remain in the pud category 
we anticipate that all the company s pud locations will be drilled and converted to pdp within five years of the date they were added 
however  pud locations and associated reserves which are no longer projected to be drilled within years from the date they were added to the proved undeveloped reserves will be removed as revisions at the time that determination is made and in the event that there are undrilled pud locations at the end of the five year period  it is our intent to remove the reserves associated with those locations from our proved reserves as revisions 
the determination of reserve estimates is a function of testing and evaluating the production and development of oil and natural gas reservoirs in order to establish a production decline curve 
the established production decline curves  in conjunction with oil and natural gas prices  development costs  production taxes and operating expenses  are used to estimate oil and natural gas reserve quantities and associated future net cash flows 
as information is processed regarding the development of individual reservoirs and as market conditions change  over time estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows will change as well 
estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows are affected by changes in product prices 
these prices have varied substantially in recent years and are expected to vary substantially from current pricing in the future 
in january  the fasb updated its oil and natural gas estimation and disclosure requirements to align its requirements with the sec s modernized oil and natural gas reporting rules  which were effective for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  the update included the following changes permitting use of new technologies to determine proved reserves  if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes  enabling companies to additionally disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors  in addition to their proved reserves  allowing previously excluded resources  such as oil sands  to be classified as oil and natural gas reserves rather than mining reserves  requiring companies to report the independence and qualifications of a preparer or auditor  based on current society of petroleum engineers criteria  requiring the filing of reports for companies that rely on a third party to prepare reserve estimates or conduct a reserve audit  and requiring companies to report oil and natural gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period  rather than year end prices 
the update was applied prospectively as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate and was effective for entities with annual reporting periods ending on or after december  effective september   the company adopted the new requirements
