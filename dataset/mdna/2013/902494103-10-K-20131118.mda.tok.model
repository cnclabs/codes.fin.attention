item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of the company we are one of the world s largest meat protein companies and the second largest food production company in the fortune with one of the most recognized brand names in the food industry 
we produce  distribute and market chicken  beef  pork  prepared foods and related allied products 
our operations are conducted in four segments chicken  beef  pork and prepared foods 
some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products  the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace  accessibility of international markets  market prices for our products  the cost and availability of live cattle and hogs  raw materials  feed ingredients  and operating efficiencies of our facilities 
overview general operating income grew in fiscal over fiscal  which was led by record earnings in our chicken segment and improved performance in our beef segment 
revenues increased to a record billion  driven by price and mix improvements 
we were able to overcome a billion increase in input costs through strong operational execution and margin management 
the following are a few of the key drivers we continued to execute our strategy of accelerating growth in domestic value added chicken sales  prepared food sales and international chicken production  innovating products  services and customer insights and cultivating our talent development to support tyson growth for the future 
market environment our chicken segment delivered record results in fiscal driven by strong demand and favorable domestic market conditions 
the chicken segment experienced increased feed costs but was able to offset the impact with operational  mix and price improvements 
our beef segment s operating performance improved  despite lower domestic availability of fed cattle supplies  due to better operational execution  less volatile live cattle markets  and stronger export markets 
our pork segment results remained within its normalized operating margin range  but were down slightly from last year due to periods of increased domestic availability of pork products 
our prepared foods segment was challenged by product mix and rapidly increasing raw material prices 
discontinued operation after conducting an assessment during fiscal of our long term business strategy in china  we determined our weifang operation weifang  which was part of our chicken segment  was no longer core to the execution of our strategy given the capital investment it required to execute our future business plan 
we completed the sale of weifang in july weifang results are reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
margins our total operating margin was in fiscal operating margins by segment were as follows chicken beef pork prepared foods debt and liquidity during fiscal  we generated billion of operating cash flows 
we repurchased million shares of our stock for million under our share repurchase program in fiscal at september   we had billion of liquidity  which includes the availability under our credit facility and billion of cash and cash equivalents

change vs 
sales sales volume change average sales price change operating income operating margin vs 
sales volume sales volumes grew due to increased domestic and international production driven by stronger demand for our chicken products 
average sales price the increase in average sales price was primarily due to mix changes and price increases associated with higher input costs 
since many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter term in nature  we were able to offset rising input costs through improved pricing and mix 
operating income operating income was positively impacted by increased average sales price  improved live performance and operational execution  as well as improved performance in our foreign produced operations 
these increases were partially offset by increased feed costs of million 
vs 
sales volume the decrease in sales volumes in fiscal was primarily attributable to the impact of domestic production cuts we made in late fiscal and maintained throughout fiscal  in order to balance our supply with forecasted customer demand 
these production cuts reduced our total domestic slaughter pounds by approximately in fiscal  but were partially offset by increases in international sales volumes and open market meat purchases 
average sales price the increase in average sales prices is primarily due to mix changes and price increases associated with reduced industry supply and increased input costs

operating income while reduced compared to prior year  operating income remained strong in fiscal despite brief periods of imbalance in industry supply and customer demand 
we were able to maintain strong operating margins by maximizing our revenues relative to the live hog markets  partially due to operational and mix performance

however  there is a lag time for price increases to take effect 
vs 
sales and operating income operating margins were positively impacted by lower raw material costs of million and increased average sales prices  which were partially offset by lower volumes and increased operational costs of approximately million  largely due to costs related to revamping our lunchmeat business and the start up of a new pepperoni plant

however  there is a lag time for price changes to take effect  which is what we experienced during fiscal 
table of contents fiscal outlook in fiscal  we expect overall domestic protein production chicken  beef  pork and turkey to increase approximately from fiscal levels 
grain supplies are expected to increase in fiscal  which should result in lower input costs 
the following is a summary of the fiscal outlook for each of our segments  as well as an outlook on sales  capital expenditures  net interest expense  debt and liquidity  share repurchases and dividends chicken we expect domestic chicken production to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal based on current futures prices  we expect lower feed costs in fiscal compared to fiscal of approximately million 
many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter term in nature  which allows us to adjust pricing when input costs fluctuate 
however  there may be a lag time for price changes to take effect 
for fiscal  we believe our chicken segment will be in or above its normalized range of 
beef we expect to see a reduction of industry fed cattle supplies of in fiscal as compared to fiscal although we generally expect adequate supplies in regions we operate our plants  there may be periods of imbalance of fed cattle supply and demand 
for fiscal  we believe our beef segment profitability will be similar to fiscal  but could be below its normalized range of 
pork we expect industry hog supplies to increase in fiscal and exports to improve compared to fiscal for fiscal  we believe our pork segment will be in its normalized range of 
prepared foods we expect operational improvements and pricing to offset increased raw material costs 
because many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter term in nature  we are typically able to offset rising input costs through increased pricing 
as we continue to invest heavily in our growth platforms  we believe our prepared foods segment could be slightly below its normalized range of for fiscal sales we expect fiscal sales to approximate billion as we continue to execute our strategy of accelerating growth in domestic value added chicken sales  prepared food sales and international chicken production
