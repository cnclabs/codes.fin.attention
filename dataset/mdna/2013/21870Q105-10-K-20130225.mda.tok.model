overview we are an owner  developer and operator of strategically located data centers in some of the largest and fastest growing data center markets in the united states  including los angeles  the san francisco bay and northern virginia areas  chicago  boston  new york city  miami and denver 
our high quality data centers feature ample and redundant power  advanced cooling and security systems and many are points of dense network interconnection 
we are able to satisfy the full spectrum of our customers data center requirements by providing data center space ranging in size from an entire building or large dedicated suites to a cage or cabinet 
we lease our space to a broad and growing customer base ranging from enterprise customers to less space intensive  more network centric customers 
our operational flexibility allows us to selectively lease data center space to its highest and best use depending on customer demand  regional economies and property characteristics 
as of december   with the exception of ny  which was acquired february   our property portfolio included operating data center facilities and multiple development projects  which collectively comprise over million nrsf  of which approximately million nrsf is existing data center space 
these properties include  nrsf of space readily available for lease  of which  nrsf is available for lease as data center space 
including the space currently under construction or in preconstruction at december   vacant space and land targeted for future development and ny  we own land and buildings sufficient to develop over million nrsf of data center space  comprised of  nrsf space under construction as of december    nrsf planned to commence development during at ny and on land that we currently own at va and our santa clara campus  and  nrsf at multiple facilities  as shown on the development table on page  that may be developed over time based on market supply  demand and our financing capabilities 
results of operations prior to the closing of our ipo on september   we had no corporate activity other than the issuance of shares of common stock in connection with the initial capitalization of our company 
the results of operations for the year ended december   reflect the financial condition and results of operations of our predecessor  together with the coresite acquired properties  from september   the date of acquisition 
the contribution or acquisition of interests in the coresite acquired properties was accounted for as an acquisition by our predecessor under the acquisition method of accounting and recognized at the estimated fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities on the date of the contribution 
our results of operations may therefore not be indicative of our future results of operations 
factors which may influence our results of operations operating revenue 
our ability to increase operating revenue generated by the properties in our portfolio  including rental  interconnection and power revenue  depends principally on our ability i to maintain the historical occupancy rates of currently leased space ii to lease currently available space and space that becomes available from leases that expire or are terminated at or in excess of current rental rates and iii to increase the number of interconnections provided to current customers 
as of december   our operating data center facilities are leased 
negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operating revenue in future periods 
future economic downturns or regional downturns affecting our markets or downturns in the technology industry that impair our ability to renew or re lease space and the ability of our customers to fulfill their lease commitments  as in the case of customer bankruptcies  could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase operating revenue at our properties 
as of december   we had  leases with over customers  the majority of our leases contained annual base rent escalations that were either fixed generally ranging from to or indexed based on a consumer price index or other similar inflation related index 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist of utilities  site maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  as well as rental expenses on our properties in which we hold a leasehold interest 
our buildings require significant power to support data center operations 
substantially all of our data center nrsf is subject to the breakered amp or sub metered branch circuit monitoring 
table of contents pricing models 
we recover all or substantially all of our electricity costs for our leased data center space under either model 
under the sub metered model  a customer pays us monthly for the power attributable to its equipment in the data center as well as for its ratable allocation of the power used to provide the cooling  lighting  security and other requirements supporting the data center  in each case  at a rate substantially equivalent to our then current cost of electricity 
under the breakered amp model  a customer pays a fixed monthly fee per committed available ampere of connected power 
the extent to which this fixed monthly fee correlates to the monthly amount we pay to our utility provider for electricity at each data center facility varies depending upon the amount of power each customer utilizes each month relative to the amount of committed power purchased 
scheduled lease expirations 
our ability to re lease expiring space at rental rates equal to or in excess of current rental rates materially affects our results of operations 
as of december   approximately  nrsf of our portfolio represented currently available space 
leases representing approximately and of the nrsf across our portfolio are scheduled to expire during the years ending december   and  respectively 
the leases scheduled to expire in and also represent approximately and  respectively  of our annualized rent as of december  we continue to see strong demand in our markets for data center space and expect the rental rates we are likely to achieve on any new or renewed leases for and expirations will generally be higher than the rates currently being paid for the same space 
for the year ended december   rents on re leased renewed space increased by an average of on a gaap basis compared to the expiring rents for the same space 
our past performance may not be indicative of future results  and we cannot assure you that leases will be renewed or that our properties will be re leased at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current average rental rates 
further  re leased renewed rental rates in a particular market may not be consistent with rental rates across our portfolio as a whole due to a number of factors  including local real estate conditions  local supply and demand for data center space  the condition of the property and whether the property  or space within the property  has been developed 
acquisitions  development and financing 
our ability to grow rental income depends on our ability to acquire  develop and lease data center space at favorable rental rates 
as of december   we had approximately million nrsf of future development and under development space or approximately of the total space in our portfolio 
we generally fund the cost of data center development from additional capital  which  for future developments  we would expect to obtain primarily through our revolving credit facility and then other unsecured and secured borrowings  construction financings and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities  when market conditions permit 
if we cannot obtain capital when needed or on favorable terms  we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities arise 
conditions in significant markets 
our operating properties are located in los angeles  the san francisco bay and northern virginia areas  boston  chicago  new york city  miami and denver 
these markets comprised        and  of our annualized rent as of december  positive or negative changes in conditions in these markets will impact our overall performance 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  change change in thousands operating revenue operating expense interest expense net income loss operating revenue 
operating revenue for the year ended december   was million 
this includes rental revenue of million  power revenue of million  interconnection of million and tenant reimbursement and other revenue of million 
this compares to operating revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was partially due to the placement into service of three computer rooms at our newest data center  sv during and the completion and subsequent leasing of expansion space at va and ch approximately  nrsf of new and expansion leases commenced during and we achieved rent growth on lease renewals 
also  we grew our interconnection services and increased interconnection prices during 
table of contents operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to additional property operating and maintenance expense associated with the placement into service of three computer rooms at our newest data center  sv  during  the completion of expansion space at va and ch and an increase in sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense due to increased employee head count 
additionally  general and administrative expense increased by million due to the settlement of two outstanding litigation matters 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due to the short term useful life of the lease intangibles acquired in connection with our ipo 
interest expense 
interest expense  including amortization of deferred financing costs  for the year ended december   was million compared to interest expense of million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest was primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest due to the number of ongoing development projects partially offset by a higher average debt balance during the year ended december  net income loss 
net income for the year ended december   was million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily due to the increased operating revenue from the placement into service of additional space at several data centers  the increase in the prices and volume of interconnection services and the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense due to the short term useful life of the lease intangibles acquired in connection with our ipo 
these increases were partially offset by the million increase in operating expenses and a million gain on early extinguishment of debt which occurred during the year ended december  year ended december   compared to year ended december  the company the predecessor total company and predecessor year ended december  for the period september  through december for the period january  through september year ended december  change change in thousands operating revenue operating expense interest expense net loss operating revenue 
operating revenue for the year ended december   was million 
this includes rental revenue of million  power revenue of million  interconnection revenue of million and tenant reimbursement and other revenue of million 
this compares to revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was due primarily to the acquisition of the coresite acquired properties on september  operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to the acquisition of the coresite acquired properties and the resulting internalization of the management function through the acquisition of coresite  llc  our management company 
these costs were partially offset by a decrease in transaction costs for potential acquisition deals that did not occur 
interest expense 
interest expense  including amortization of deferred financing costs  for the year ended december   was million compared to interest expense of million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was due to increased debt balances from the acquisition of the coresite acquired properties 
the increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest due to the increase in properties under development 
net loss 
net loss for the year ended december   was million compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the decreased net loss of million was primarily due to increased operating revenue from the acquisition of the coresite acquired properties and a reduction in transaction costs associated with our acquisition of the coresite acquired properties 
these increases were partially offset by the acquisition of the coresite acquired properties and the resulting internalization of the management function through the acquisition of coresite  llc  our management company  and increased interest expense 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources discussion of cash flows year ended december   compared to year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increased cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to the placement into service and subsequent leasing of data center space and an increase in the price and volume of interconnection services year over year 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures related to development of data center space 
during the years ended december   and  we placed into service  nrsf and  nrsf  respectively 
of the  nrsf placed into service during the year ended december   a large portion of the development costs were paid during the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by financing activities of million was primarily due to the million proceeds from the sale of our series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock in december we used these proceeds to repay outstanding mortgage loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility during also  we increase our dividends paid during analysis of liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and equivalents  excluding million of restricted cash 
restricted cash primarily consists of interest bearing cash deposits required by the terms of our loans and cash impound accounts for real estate taxes and insurance as required by our mortgage loans 
during the year ended december   restricted cash decreased by million primarily due to the release of lender held escrows for the sv mortgage loan 
the loan agreement required us to fund a specified amount of capital improvements at sv which were completed during  and the lender released the escrows 
we have an effective shelf registration statement filed on september   that allows us to register unspecified various classes of equity and debt securities 
on december   we issued million shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock for total net proceeds  after underwriting discounts and offering expenses  of million  including the proceeds from the exercise of the full underwriters over allotment option 
the net proceeds received were used to repay million of borrowing under our revolving credit facility  the full amount of the mortgage loan payable of million encumbering our va property and for general corporate purposes  including development opportunities 
our short term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds needed for future distributions to common and preferred stockholders and holders of our operating partnership units  interest expense  operating costs including utilities  site maintenance costs  real estate and personal property taxes  insurance  rental expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses and certain capital expenditures  including for the development of data center space during the next months 
subject to our ability to obtain capital with favorable terms  our anticipated development activity over the next months will require approximately million to million of investment to expand our operating data center portfolio 
we expect to meet our short and long term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and by incurring additional indebtedness  including by drawing on our revolving credit facility 
subsequent to december   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement  which increased our borrowing capacity to million 
at december   we had no outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility 
our ability to borrow under the second amended and restated agreement is subject to ongoing compliance with a number of financial covenants and other customary restrictive covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants under our second amended and restated credit agreement 
our long term liquidity requirements primarily consist of the costs to fund the development of the santa clara campus  the one wilshire campus  va  ny  future development of other space in our portfolio not currently scheduled  property acquisitions  future distributions to common and preferred stockholders and holders of our operating partnership units  scheduled debt maturities and capital improvements 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements primarily by incurring long term indebtedness  such as property mortgage loans  and drawing on our revolving credit facility 
we also may raise capital in the future through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities  subject to prevailing market conditions  and or through the issuance of operating partnership units 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all 

table of contents inflation many of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations 
in addition  many of the leases provide for fixed base rent increases 
we believe that inflationary increases may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense escalations described above 
indebtedness a summary of outstanding indebtedness as of december  and is as follows in thousands interest rate maturity date december  december  sv mortgage loan and at december   and  respectively october  revolving credit facility and at december   and  respectively january  ch senior mortgage loan repaid in march n a va mortgage loan repaid in december n a total principal outstanding as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants under our revolving credit facility and the sv mortgage loan 
for additional information with respect to our outstanding indebtedness as of december   and december   as well as the available credit under our existing revolving credit facility  debt covenant requirements  and future debt maturities  refer to note debt in financial statements and supplementary data included in the annual report 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   including the maturities and scheduled principal repayments of indebtedness in thousands obligation thereafter total operating leases mortgages payable construction contracts other total includes million of mortgage principal payments and annual interest payments until debt maturity of million in and million in the mortgage payable is subject to variable rates and we estimated payments based on the interest rate as of december  obligations for construction contracts for properties under construction and other capital improvements 
obligations for tenant improvement work at sv  power contracts  and telecommunications leases 
other off balance sheet arrangements as of december   other than our operating leases  construction contracts and other items disclosed above  we did not have any other off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note summary of significant accounting policies in financial statements and supplementary data included in this annual report 
we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date hereof 
acquisition of real estate 
we apply purchase accounting to the assets and liabilities related to all of our real estate investments acquired 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to the acquired tangible assets  consisting primarily of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and lease origination costs 
these allocation assessments involve significant judgment and complex calculations and have a direct impact on our results of operations 
capitalization of costs 
capitalized lease commissions consist of commissions paid to third party leasing agents and internal sales commissions paid to employees for the successful execution of lease agreements 
during the years ended december    for the period from september  to december   and for the period from january  to september   we capitalized million   million  million and million  respectively  of internal sales commissions 
direct and indirect costs that are clearly associated with the development of properties are capitalized as incurred 
during the land development and construction periods  we capitalize construction costs  legal fees  financing costs  real estate taxes and insurance and internal costs of personnel performing development  if such costs are incremental and identifiable to a specific development project 
we cease cost capitalization on development space once the space is ready for its intended use and held available for occupancy 
indirect costs that do not clearly relate to the projects under development are not capitalized and are charged to expense as incurred 
indirect costs capitalized for the years ended december   and  for the period from september  to december   and for the period from january  to september  are as follows in thousands the company the predecessor year ended december  year ended december  for the period september  through december  for the period january  through september  interest real estate taxes and insurance employee salaries capitalized development costs useful lives of assets 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income 
buildings are depreciated on a straight line basis over to years 
additionally we depreciate building improvements over ten years for owned properties and the remaining term of the original lease for leased properties 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the asset 
recoverability of long lived assets 
we review the carrying value of our properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is recognized when estimated expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from an asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies to a considerable extent on assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital 
if  in future periods  there are changes in the estimates or assumptions incorporated into an impairment review analysis  these changes could result in an adjustment to the carrying amount of our assets 
to the extent that impairment has occurred  the excess of the carrying amount of the property over its estimated fair value would be charged against net income 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 

table of contents goodwill 
the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired including identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
our goodwill has an indeterminate life and is not amortized  but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we utilized the qualitative assessment for our annual impairment test 
revenue recognition 
rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancellable term of customer leases 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are recorded as deferred rent receivable on our consolidated balance sheets 
many of our leases contain provisions under which our customers reimburse us for a portion of direct operating expenses  including power  as well as real estate taxes and insurance 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are recognized 
we recognize the amortization of the acquired above market and below market leases as decreases and increases  respectively  to rental revenue over the remaining non cancellable term of the underlying leases 
if the value of below market leases includes renewal option periods  we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized 
interconnection and utility services are considered separate earnings processes that are typically provided and completed on a month to month basis and revenue is recognized in the period that the services are performed 
set up charges and utility installation fees are initially deferred and recognized over the lease term or the expected period of performance unless management determines a separate earnings process exists related to an installation charge 
we must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements and other income 
we analyze individual accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 
share based awards 
we generally recognize compensation expense related to share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
the calculation of the fair value of share based awards is subjective and requires several assumptions over such items as expected stock volatility  dividend payments and interest rates 
these assumptions have a direct impact on our net income because a higher share based awards amount would result in lower net income for a particular period 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss and asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income as of january  for additional information with respect to the recent accounting pronouncements refer to note summary of significant accounting policies in financial statements and supplementary data included in this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the primary market risk to which we believe we are exposed is interest rate risk 
our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control contribute to interest rate risk 
as of december   we had million of consolidated indebtedness that bore interest at variable rates 
we monitor our market risk exposures using a sensitivity analysis 
our sensitivity analysis estimates the exposure to market risk sensitive instruments assuming a hypothetical change in year end interest rates 
if interest rates were to increase by  the increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by less than million annually 
if interest rates were to decrease  the decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would be less than million annually 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could impact interest rates 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to interest rates 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
also  our revolving credit facility had a zero balance as of december   and therefore was not include in theses analyses
