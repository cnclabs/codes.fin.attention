item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview flir systems  inc flir  the company  we  us  or our is a world leader in sensor systems that enhance perception and awareness 
we were founded in and have since become a premier designer  manufacturer  and marketer of thermal imaging systems 
our advanced sensors and integrated sensor systems enable the gathering and analysis of critical information through a wide variety of applications in commercial  industrial  and government markets worldwide 
our goal is to both enable our customers to benefit from the valuable information produced by advanced sensing technologies and to deliver sustained superior financial performance for our shareholders 
we create value for our customers by providing advanced surveillance and tactical defense capabilities  improving personal and public safety and security  facilitating air  ground  and maritime navigation  enhancing enjoyment of the outdoors  providing infrastructure inefficiency information  conveying pre emptive structural deficiency data  displaying process irregularities  and enabling commercial business opportunities through our continual support and development of new thermal imaging data and analytics applications 
our business model meets the needs of a multitude of customers we sell off the shelf products to a wide variety of markets in an efficient  timely  and affordable manner as well as offer a variety of system configurations to suit specific customer requirements 
centered on the design of products for low cost manufacturing and high volume distribution  our commercial operating model has been developed over time and provides us with a unique ability to adapt to market changes and meet our customers needs 
our business is organized into two divisions commercial systems and government systems 
within these divisions  we have five reporting segments thermal vision measurement and raymarine  which comprise the commercial systems division  and surveillance  detection and integrated systems  which make up our government systems division 
for a more detailed description of our segments  see business segments within item international revenue accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent of our revenue in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue in the future 
we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies 
factors contributing to this variability include significant manufacturing activity in europe  significant sales denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  and cross currency fluctuations between such currencies as the united states dollar  euro  swedish kroner and british pound sterling 
the impact of those fluctuations is reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements  but in the aggregate  did not have a material impact on our results of operations 
we experience fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variations and customer sales cycles  such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states and certain foreign governments  the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations  and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration 
such events have resulted and could continue to result in fluctuations in quarterly results in the future 
as a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we expect that the challenging world wide economic conditions that impacted revenue performance in will continue to impact our business going forward 
more specifically  reduced spending by united states and middle east government agencies  the continuing eurozone crisis  the impact in the united states of the year end expiration of income and payroll tax cuts  and  in the absence of action by the united states congress to the contrary  potential material reductions in federal spending resulting from the budget control act of  among other global economic developments  all present challenges for us and render predictions regarding future performance difficult to make 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  goodwill  warranty obligations  contingencies and income taxes on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price and with a reasonable assurance of collection  passage of title to the customer as indicated by the shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations 
we design  market and sell our products primarily as commercial  off the shelf products 
certain customers request different system configurations  generally based on standard options or accessories that we offer 
in general  our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based upon customer specified acceptance criteria 
in those limited circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance if we cannot demonstrate that the system meets those specifications prior to shipment 
for any contracts with multiple elements ie  training  installation  additional parts  etc 
we allocate revenue among the deliverables primarily based upon objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each element in the arrangement 
if objective and reliable evidence of fair value of any element is not available  we use an estimated selling price for purposes of allocating the total arrangement consideration among the elements 
in addition  judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that collectability is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
actual write offs during the past three years have not been material to our results of operations 
we also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million 
we believe our reported allowances at december   are adequate 
if the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made 
inventory 
our policy is to record inventory write downs when conditions exist that indicate that our inventories are likely to be in excess of anticipated demand or are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usages are evaluated within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our write downs are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value and establish a new cost basis 
as of december   our inventories of million are stated net of inventory write downs 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
goodwill 
we have recorded goodwill in connection with our business acquisitions 
we review goodwill in june of each year  or on an interim basis if required  for impairment to determine if events or changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expect the assets to generate within the boundaries of the applicable business segments of the company 
our current review indicates that no adjustments are necessary for the goodwill assets  which have a carrying value of million as of december  product warranties 
our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time  generally twelve to twenty four months  at no cost to our customers 
our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
we believe that our recorded liability of million at december  is adequate to cover our future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
income taxes 
we record our deferred tax assets when the benefits are more likely than not to be recognized 
valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when a determination is made that the deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized in the future 
in making that determination  on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  we estimate our future taxable income based upon historical operating results and external market data 
future levels of taxable income are dependent upon  but not limited to  general economic conditions  competitive pressures and other factors beyond our control 
as of december   we have determined that a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of million is required 
if we should determine that we may be unable to realize our deferred tax assets to the extent reported  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
consolidated operating results the following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue year ended december  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses earnings from operations interest expense interest income other income  net earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision earnings from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net earnings totals may not recompute due to rounding the following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by addressing key elements in our consolidated statements of income 
the segment operating results section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated revenue and earnings from operations for  and given the nature of our business  we believe revenue and earnings from operations including operating margin percentage are most relevant to an understanding of our performance at a segment level 
additionally  at the segment level we disclose backlog  which represents orders received for products or services for which a sales agreement is in place and delivery is expected within twelve months 
the operating results for do not include any amounts for either lorex or traficon as any such amounts were not significant 
revenue 
revenue for totaled  million  a decrease of percent from revenue of  million 
each of our operating segments  except integrated systems  reported decreases in year over year revenues due to continued reductions in demand for our products from united states government and middle east government agencies and weaker world wide economic conditions resulting in lower demand for many of our commercial product lines 
the decline of million in year over year revenue included a decline of million from united states government customers 
revenue for totaled  million  an increase of percent over revenue of  million 
the increase was primarily due to increased revenue from our thermal vision and measurement segment  and a full year of revenues reported by raymarine holdings  ltd 
raymarine which was acquired on may   and icx technologies  inc icx which was acquired on october  excluding revenue from raymarine and icx  revenue for the year ended december  was flat compared to the same period in as revenue from our thermal vision and measurement segment increased by percent in compared to the same period in  while revenue from our surveillance segment declined by percent in compared to the same period in international revenue in totaled million  representing percent of revenue 
this compares with international revenue in which totaled million  representing percent of revenue and million in  representing percent of revenue 
while the sales mix between united states and international sales may fluctuate from year to year  we expect revenue from customers outside the united states to continue to comprise a significant portion of our total revenue on a long term basis 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the year over year decrease in cost of goods sold primarily relate to the lower year over year revenues and changes in product mix 
in the year ended december   costs of goods sold included restructuring charges of million  primarily for work force reductions in our thermal vision and measurement and detection segments  in the year ended december   costs of goods sold included restructuring charges of million 
for the year ended december   costs of goods sold included charges of million for the amortization of fair value adjustments on inventory acquired through the acquisition of icx in cost of goods sold in of million was an increase of million  or percent  over cost of goods sold of million in the increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues year over year as discussed above 
for the year ended december   cost of goods sold included charges of million for the amortization of fair value adjustments on inventory of icx 
cost of goods sold includes materials  labor and overhead costs incurred in the manufacturing of products and services sold in the period as well as warranty costs 
material costs include raw materials  purchased components and sub assemblies  outside processing and inbound freight costs 
labor and overhead costs consist of direct and indirect manufacturing costs  including wages and fringe benefits  operating supplies  depreciation and amortization  occupancy costs  and purchasing  receiving and inspection costs 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared to million in gross margin  defined as gross profit divided by revenue  decreased from percent in to percent in the decrease in gross profit in was primarily due to the lower revenue year over year and a lower consolidated gross margin 
gross margin decreased in from primarily due to a shift in product mix in both our thermal vision and measurement and surveillance segments and reduced absorption of fixed costs due to lower revenues  partially offset by the elimination of amortization expenses related to fair value adjustments on inventory of icx 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million compared to million in gross margin decreased from percent in to percent in the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a higher percentage of revenue from raymarine and icx business units  both of which have historically lower gross margins than our other business segments  as well as a change in the product mix in our surveillance segment 
these effects were partially offset by the continued production efficiencies realized from increased volumes in our thermal vision and measurement segment 
excluding raymarine and the icx business units  gross margins were percent in  up slightly from percent in research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or percent of revenue in  compared to million  or percent of revenue  in  and million  or percent of revenue  in the decrease in research and development expenses in from was primarily due to cost containment efforts in light of the decrease in revenue 
the increase in research and development expenses in over was due to increased investment in new product development as well as the research and development activity conducted by newly acquired companies 
we believe that spending levels are sufficient to support the development of new products and the continued growth of the business 
we expect research and development expenses to be approximately to percent of revenue on a long term basis 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or percent of revenue in compared to million  or percent of revenue  in and million  or percent of revenue  in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to the payment of a million litigation settlement in  cost control efforts taken in in light of the revenue decline and lower annual incentive expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to the operating expenses related to businesses acquired during which represented million of the increase and the million litigation settlement in while selling  general and administrative expenses may be affected in the future by acquisitions with different cost structures  we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses to increase at a slower rate than revenue in our existing businesses 
interest expense 
interest expense totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense in and is primarily attributable to the interest expense associated with the million aggregate principal amount of percent senior unsecured notes due september  that were issued in august and the amortization of the costs related to the issuance of the notes 
interest expense in is primarily attributable to interest on the convertible notes that were issued in june  the amortization of the discounts recorded on the notes and the costs related to the issuance of the notes 
the convertible notes were fully converted by june income taxes 
our income tax provision was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for  and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the mix in taxable income between our united states and international operations has a significant impact on our annual income tax provision and effective tax rates 
our effective tax rate is lower than the united states federal tax rate of percent because of lower foreign tax rates  the effect of foreign  federal and state tax credits and other one time items such as amended tax filings and business dispositions 
for  the effective tax rate decrease was primarily due to the impact of a multi year agreement  effective august   with a european jurisdiction  the effect of amended state tax filings  and the impact of revaluations of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to changes in certain foreign statutory tax rates 
we expect the effective tax rate for to be approximately percent excluding discrete items 
at december   the company had united states tax net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately million which expire between and in addition  the company has various state net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately million which expire between and the federal and state net operating losses were generated by icx technologies  inc prior to being acquired by us in finally  the company has various foreign net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately million which expire between and tax benefits as described above are recorded as assets when the benefits are more likely than not to be recognized 
to the extent that we assess the realization of such assets to not be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded 
we believe that the net deferred tax assets of million reflected on the december  consolidated balance sheet are materially realizable based on future forecasts of taxable income over a relatively short time horizon  but we have determined that a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of million is required  primarily related to certain acquired net operating losses 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered  including past and future performance  the market environment in which the company operates  utilization of tax attributes in the past  length of carryback and carryforward periods  and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies when evaluating whether the deferred tax assets will be realized 
discontinued operations 
in  in connection with the acquisition of icx  we began to pursue the sale of certain business units of icx and the results of operations for such business units were reported as discontinued operations until their respective dispositions 
during the second quarter of  we sold the remaining two business units reported as discontinued operations 
the operating losses of those operations  including insignificant associated losses recognized subsequent to their disposal  and the net losses on the sales of the units  net of tax are reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  segment operating results as of january   we merged the thermography and commercial vision systems operating segments into the thermal vision and measurement operating segment 
raymarine was acquired on may   creating the raymarine operating segment 
finally  icx was acquired on october  and the icx operating results for the period from acquisition through december  was reported as a separate segment 
effective as of january   icx results are reported as our detection and integrated system segments  and a portion is reported in our surveillance segment 
beginning january   the former government systems operating segment is also included in the surveillance operating segment 
thermal vision and measurement thermal vision and measurement operating results are as follows in millions year ended december  revenue earnings from operations operating margin backlog thermal vision and measurement revenue decreased by percent in compared to  primarily due to lower revenues in the cores and components product line and the premium thermography product lines 
revenue declined in all geographies due to world wide economic weaknesses which were particularly significant in our europe  middle east and africa regions 
united states revenue was adversely impacted by lower revenue from cores and components customers 
earnings from operations decreased by percent due to the flow through of lower revenues and lower absorption of factory costs partially offset by a percent reduction in operating expenses 
revenue increased by percent in compared to primarily due to increased unit deliveries from several of the segment s product lines including thermography  cores and components  and maritime 
earnings from operations increased by percent due to the increase in revenue and manufacturing efficiencies resulting from higher production volumes and lower material costs on new products 
raymarine raymarine operating results are as follows in millions year ended december  revenue earnings from operations operating margin backlog raymarine segment revenue for the year ended december  decreased by percent  compared to  primarily due to weak market conditions in europe 
earnings from operations in decreased by percent compared to primarily due to lower revenue resulting in lower gross profit  largely offset by a percent reduction in operating expenses 
operating results for are for the period from may  through december  raymarine earnings from operations include the impact of the amortization of intangible assets of million in  million in and million in surveillance surveillance operating results are as follows in millions year ended december  revenue earnings from operations operating margin backlog surveillance segment revenue decreased by percent in compared to  primarily due to a percent decrease in revenue from us government customers 
earnings from operations declined by percent due to lower revenues  lower gross margins resulting from a change in segment product mix  partially offset by a percent decrease in operating expenses 
revenue decreased by percent in compared to  primarily due to decreases in revenue from us government agencies  partially offset by revenue of million from icx business units  which were acquired on october  lower revenue and increased segment operating expenses caused the decline in earnings from operations and operating margin from to the decline in backlog from to was primarily due to the reduction in procurement activity by our us government customers 
detection detection operating results are as follows in millions year ended december  revenue earnings loss from operations operating margin backlog detection segment revenue for the year ended december  decreased by percent compared to the same period of  primarily due to two significant program deliveries in and to lower research and development contract revenues pursuant to the segment strategy to reduce its customer paid research and development activity 
the loss from operations in included the amortization of fair value adjustments on inventory of million 
the elimination of the fair value inventory adjustment and a percent reduction in operating expenses partially offset by lower revenues were the main factors contributing to the improvement in operating results for compared to operating results for are for the period from october  through december  the earnings from operations include the impact of the amortization of fair value adjustments on inventory of million and million in and  respectively 
the fair value adjustment on inventory related to purchase price accounting and the adjustment was fully amortized in integrated systems integrated systems operating results are as follows in millions year ended december  revenue earnings from operations operating margin backlog integrated systems segment revenue for the year ended december  increased by percent over  primarily due to an increase in large program revenue recognized year over year 
backlog at december  reflects an increase due to several large program contracts booked during operating results for are for the period from october  through december  the earnings from operations include the impact of the amortization of fair value adjustments on inventory of million and million in and  respectively 
the fair value adjustment on inventory related to purchase price accounting and the adjustment was fully amortized in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had a total of million in cash and cash equivalents  million of which was in the united states and million at our foreign subsidiaries  compared to cash and cash equivalents at december  of million  of which million was in the united states and million at our foreign subsidiaries 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in was primarily due to the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million  business acquisitions of million  capital expenditures of million and dividends paid of million  partially offset by cash provided from operations 
cash provided by operating activities in totaled million compared to million in and million in the increase in cash provided from operating activities in compared to was primarily due to a year over year reduction in cash used for certain working capital components  particularly inventories and income tax related assets and liabilities 
the decrease in cash provided from operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the decrease in net earnings partially offset by a year over year reduction in cash used for certain working capital components 
cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  primarily consisting of the acquisition of lorex technology inc for million and traficon international nv for million and capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures in included building improvements for our facilities in nashua  new hampshire  taby  sweden and croissy beaubourg  france and equipment requirements for existing and future product lines 
cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  primarily consisting of the acquisition of aerius photonics  llc for million and capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures in included the purchase of a building in fareham  united kingdom and building improvements for our facilities in nashua  new hampshire and taby  sweden 
cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  primarily consisting of the acquisitions of raymarine for million and icx for million and capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures in included the purchase of two buildings for million 
cash used by financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  primarily consisting of the repurchase of shares of our common stock and the payment of dividends 
cash provided from financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  primarily consisting of the net proceeds of million from the issuance of our percent senior unsecured notes due september  the notes and cash provided from our stock based compensation plans partially offset by the payment of dividends and repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock 
cash provided from financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  primarily consisting of the repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock  offset by proceeds from shares issued for  and tax benefits recognized from  our stock based compensation plans 
on february   we entered into a credit agreement credit agreement with bank of america  na  na bank national association  jpmorgan chase bank na and other lenders 
the credit agreement provides for a million  five year revolving line of credit 
we have the right  subject to certain conditions including approval of additional commitments by qualified lenders  to increase the line of credit by an additional million until february  the credit agreement allows us and certain designated subsidiaries to borrow in united states dollars  euro  kroner  pound sterling and other agreed upon currencies 
the credit agreement requires us to pay a commitment fee on the amount of unused credit at a rate  based on the company s leverage ratio  which ranges from percent to percent 
the credit agreement contains two financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage ratios with which we were in compliance at december  the five year revolving line of credit available under the credit agreement is unsecured 
at december   we had no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement and the commitment fee on the amount of unused credit was percent 
we had million and million of letters of credit outstanding at december  and  respectively  which reduced the total available credit under the credit agreement 
on august   the company issued million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses  which are being amortized over a period of five years 
interest is payable on the notes semi annually in arrears on march and september the proceeds from the notes are being used for general corporate purposes  which may include working capital and capital expenditure needs  business acquisitions and repurchases of our common stock 
we believe that our existing cash combined with the cash we anticipate generating from operating activities  and our available credit facilities and financing available from other sources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months 
we do not have any significant commitments nor are we aware of any significant events or conditions that are likely to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we leased our non owned facilities under operating lease agreements 
we also leased certain operating machinery and equipment and office equipment under operating lease agreements 
except for these operating lease agreements  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest operating leases licensing rights post retirement obligations other obligations principal and interest on long term debt  operating leases and licensing rights obligations are based upon contractual terms 
actual payments may differ in terms of both timing and amounts 
the company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of potential cash settlement of its unrecognized tax benefits of million and  therefore has not included the unrecognized tax benefits in the table of significant contractual obligations as of december  for further detail on unrecognized tax benefits  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we did not include approximately million of standby letters of credit and performance bonds due to the unlikely event of payment  if any  of amounts under those arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements 
the credit agreements are at variable rates 
a change in interest rates under the credit agreements impacts the interest that we incur and our cash flows 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under our credit agreements  consequently  no sensitivity analysis is presented 
we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
similarly  certain revenues from products sold in countries outside the united states and costs associated with non us operations are denominated in foreign currencies 
for more information on our foreign currency translation  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item assets and liabilities located outside the united states are primarily located in europe 
our investments in subsidiaries outside the united states with functional currencies other than the united states dollar are considered long term 
we currently engage in forward currency exchange contracts and other similar hedging activities to reduce our economic exposure to changes in exchange rates 
at december   exchange contracts with a notional amount of approximately million were outstanding 
because we market  sell and license our products throughout the world  we could be adversely affected by weak economic conditions in international markets that could reduce demand for our products 
our net investment in subsidiaries outside the united states  translated into united states dollars using the period end exchange rates  was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the potential loss in fair value is primarily due to the increase in the net investment of subsidiaries outside the united states 
we have no plans to liquidate any of our subsidiaries outside the united states  and therefore  foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our international investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not increase or reduce our reported net earnings
