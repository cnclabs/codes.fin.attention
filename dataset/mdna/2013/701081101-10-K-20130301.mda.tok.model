item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook overview we made significant progress in on several important projects aimed at improving the competitive position of some of our key operations  while sustaining our operating performance under challenging market conditions 
by mid year  we had achieved significant growth in revenues and earnings  with contributions from our domestic drilling  rental tools  and international drilling operations 
this was primarily driven by the expansion of drilling activity in the us land and gom markets and steady and uninterrupted work for the portion of our international rig fleet that was under contract 
during the second half of the year  drilling activity in the us land and gom markets underwent a slow and steady decline 
this led to reduced demand and increased competitive conditions for our rental tools and barge drilling businesses 
at the same time  international and local operators reduced their drilling programs in several of the international markets we serve  providing fewer opportunities to maintain our rig fleet utilization 
as we worked on operational responses to the changes in market conditions  we also were focused on completing or progressing several projects that are important to our future success 
included among these were completing construction of our new aadu rigs  initiating the repositioning of our international rig fleet for more sustainable and profitable performance  and maximizing the organic growth opportunities of our rental tools business 
by year end  we had successfully commissioned rig  the first of our two aadu rigs developed to safely and efficiently perform in environmentally sensitive  harsh arctic environments 
rig commenced operating in mid december 
our second rig completed client acceptance testing and began drilling in february both aadu rigs are expected to be cash flow contributors during the successful development of the aadu rigs marks an important milestone in our history of supporting responsible arctic drilling through innovative technologies and reliable performance 
we believe this level of arctic expertise is unique in our industry and are committed to leveraging this knowledge to benefit our clients going forward 
actions to achieve sustainable improvement in our international drilling rig fleet utilization continued throughout of particular focus was the group of nine rigs serving the kazakhstan market 
at one point in  only two of those rigs were under contract 
by year end  three rigs were under contract in kazakhstan  a contract for a fourth rig to work in kazakhstan was being negotiated  and several rigs were under consideration for work in other markets 
in february   we contracted two of the rigs in kazakhstan for work in the kurdistan region of iraq and began preparing them for mobilization 
our efforts to improve overall fleet utilization included consideration of the strategic value of the geographic position of all our rigs 
during  we undertook the relocation of our rigs in north africa  moving our two rigs out of algeria to reposition them for work other markets 
in addition  we worked to expand our business opportunities in the latin america region  a key market we believe can provide long term profitable growth 
in  we continued to make investments in our rental tools segment 
this included purchases of drill pipe and related products to meet the increased demand for drilling activity in several oil and natural gas liquids rich plays in the us land market  and building our capacity to participate in the growing gom offshore drilling market by purchasing more of the tubular products unique to that market 
we invested million of capital in the rental tools business in  most of which was for new equipment to serve these two opportunities 

table of contents other achievements in that contributed to our results and are expected to have an impact on future performance were we continued to hold the lead position in the us gom barge drilling market  measured by barge drilling rigs working 
according to industry compiled information  over percent of all wells drilled by barge rigs in the inland waters of the gom during were drilled by parker rigs 
we continued our involvement in the development of the enl berkut platform  providing construction oversight of the drilling package during the platform s shipyard construction phase  with expectation that the rig will move to sakhalin island  russia for operations 
outlook our markets are highly cyclical  driven by  among other things  our customers responses to price trends in oil and natural gas  the level of energy exploration and resource development spending e p spending in the domestic and international markets in which we operate  and technological advancements in energy exploration and production 
we expect oil and natural gas prices to remain near current levels or improve modestly in recent industry surveys project worldwide e p spending to rise  with the greatest increases in offshore exploration and development and the middle east land market 
meanwhile  enhanced production in the us of oil natural gas liquids and natural gas  brought about by the technological advancements accompanying the application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing  is expected to lead to continued drilling activity in the us land market 
based on recent market trends  competitive conditions and the state of our operations  we anticipate to see improvements in operating results as the year progresses 
the growing level of drilling activity in the deep water us gom should provide expanding business opportunities for our rental tools operations that will offset some of the impact of slowing activity and more competitive conditions in the us land drilling market 
we expect to continue to lead in the gom barge drilling market and to use our performance driven customer focus to maintain strong utilization and dayrates 
our two aadu rigs are operating under contract on the alaskan north slope and they are projected to generate reliable cash flow during the year 
we have been transforming our international drilling activities  focused both on enhancing the deployment of the assets we have in the field and on leveraging our drilling expertise through o m contracts 
as we execute this transformation and develop opportunities to employ our international rig fleet further repositioning of rigs may lead to uneven operating results 
as we make progress in expanding our contract drilling business  we expect the contribution to parker s results to improve

operations rental tools rental tools segment revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to revenues for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in rentals to offshore gom customers and greater tool sales and repair revenues 
this was partially offset by the impact of soft us natural gas prices that led to reduced demand from the us land drilling market and lower rental tools utilization in key operating areas 
rental tools segment operating gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared with operating gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  for the year ended december   primarily due to increased price competition in key us land drilling markets  and the impact of an increase in lower margin tools sales and repair revenues 
us barge drilling us barge drilling segment revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with revenues for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in rig fleet utilization and overall higher average dayrates for both of these factors reflect a general increase in overall drilling activity in the us gom shallow water drilling market

the introduction of these rigs to the alaskan north slope is expected to improve drilling efficiency  operating consistency and safety in this remote and challenging environment 
us drilling segment operating gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  was a loss of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating expenses include start up costs associated with re entering the alaskan market  such as salaries and employee hiring related expenditures  training and rental of facilities in alaska to support our operations 
additionally  early in the third quarter of we began incurring depreciation expense and ceased capitalizing interest costs related to one of the rigs when it was presented to the customer to begin the acceptance testing process 
international drilling international drilling segment revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the lower revenues are primarily due to a decrease in revenue generated by our o m contracts and a decline in our drilling revenues generated through the operation of rigs that we own 
o m revenues decreased to million  or for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the completion in of a drilling rig relocation project in sakhalin island  russia and lower rates associated with our services contracts in sakhalin island 
this was partially offset by increased operating and reimbursable revenues associated with the orlan platform contract as it moved from warm stack mode to fully operational mode during  the benefits of a new one rig service contract in china  and the operation during much of of a customer owned rig in papua new guinea 
o m projects included million and million of reimbursable costs for the years ended december  and reimbursable costs add to revenues but have little direct impact on operating margins 
revenues related to parker owned rigs decreased to million or for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  revenues declined in the eastern hemisphere region primarily due to lower utilization of our arctic class barge rig in the caspian sea and reduced dayrates on our rig in papua new guinea 
the decrease was partially offset by increased revenues in algeria as a result of the mobilization and start up of two rigs during and a contribution from demobilization fees in the latin america region as two rigs completed work during the year 
international drilling operating gross margin  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in operating gross margin for the year ended december  was due to decreased margins for both our o m operations and our parker owned rig operations 
operating margins generated by our o m operations were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in handling fees associated with lower reimbursable costs charged back to customers and lower project management fees related to the drilling rig relocation project in sakhalin island  russia that was completed prior to december  and lower rates associated with our service contracts in sakhalin island as we transitioned from higher value operating contracts to cost plus contracts during this was partially offset by the gross margins associated with the orlan platform contract as it moved from warm stack mode to fully operational mode during and the benefits of a new one rig service contract in china 

table of contents our margins related to parker owned rigs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in operating gross margins was primarily the result of lower rig utilization related to our arctic class barge rig in the caspian sea and a non cash charge to reserve certain value added tax assets resulting from a strategic decision to move two rigs out of the kazakhstan market 
partially offsetting this decrease were increased operating gross margins resulting from the start up of two rigs in algeria during and increased utilization and demobilization revenues with minimal demobilization costs in latin america 
in addition  results for included million of expense related to equity tax assessments in latin america 
technical services technical services segment revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to expiration of the pre operations phase of the liberty project at the end of the second quarter of and the transition of the berkut platform project from its engineering phase to a less revenue intensive construction oversight and assistance phase 
also contributing to the decrease was the completion of a pre feed project at the end of the second quarter of operating gross margin for this segment decreased by million to a loss of million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the decrease in operating gross margin was primarily due to the completion of a pre feed project at the end of the second quarter of  the transition of the berkut platform project into a less revenue intensive construction oversight and assistance phase  and the costs to retain technical capabilities as we transition between projects 
the technical services segment incurs minimal depreciation and amortization primarily related to office furniture and fixtures

the remaining million aggregate principal amount of non tendered notes was subsequently paid off at their stated maturity on july  concurrently with the issuance of the notes  we purchased a convertible note hedge note hedge and sold warrants in private transactions with counterparties that were different than the ultimate holders of the notes 
the note hedge allowed us to receive shares of our common stock from the counterparties to the transaction equal to the amount of common stock related to the excess conversion value that we would issue and or pay to the holders of the notes upon conversion 
the warrants allowed us to sell  common shares at a strike price of per share 
the note hedge expired on july   the maturity date of the notes 
the warrants expired ratably from october  to february  because we had the choice of settling the call options and the warrants in cash or shares of our common stock and these contracts met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification  the cost of the call options and proceeds from the sale of the warrants were classified in stockholders equity in the consolidated condensed balance sheets 
in addition  because both of these contracts are classified in stockholders equity and were indexed solely to our common stock  they were not accounted for as derivatives 
debt issuance costs related to the notes of approximately million were amortized over the five year term of the notes using the effective interest method

liberty project status in november  bp informed us that it was suspending construction on the project to review the rig s engineering and design  including its safety systems 
the liberty rig construction contract expired on february  prior to completion of the rig 
before expiration of the construction contract  bp identified several areas of concern relating to design  construction and invoicing for which it asked us to provide explanations and documentation  and we did so 
although we provided bp with the requested information  we do not know when or how these issues will be resolved with our client 
the liberty rig construction contract was a fixed fee and reimbursable contract that we accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
costs of the project were reimbursed without markup  except for costs associated with changes in work scope  for which we were entitled to a markup 
as of december   we had recognized million in project to date revenues and the entire million fixed fee margin on the contract 
after expiration of the construction contract  the company and bp continued activities to preserve and maintain the rig under the pre operations phase of an o m contract  which was entered into in august and expired on july  a new consulting services agreement was reached between the company and bp effective july  under the consulting services agreement  we assisted bp in a review of the rig s design  the creation of a new statement of requirements for the rig  and the transition of documentation and materials to bp 
all work under the consulting agreement has been completed and we are engaged with bp on construction contract close out resolution 
in june  bp publicly announced that it had made the decision to suspend the liberty project indefinitely 
we do not know whether or how that decision may impact our discussions with bp related to contract close out 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to fair value of assets  bad debt  materials and supplies obsolescence  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  workers compensation and health insurance and contingent liabilities for which settlement is deemed to be probable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that such estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies as they are complex and require significant judgments  assumptions and or estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements 
for purposes of recording fair value adjustments for certain financial and non financial assets and liabilities  and determining fair value disclosures  we estimate fair value at a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market for the asset or liability 
our valuation technique requires inputs that we categorize using a three level hierarchy  from highest to lowest level of observable inputs  as follows unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level  direct or indirect observable inputs  including quoted prices or other market data  for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or identical assets or liabilities in less active markets level and unobservable inputs that require significant judgment for which there is little or no market data level 
when multiple input levels are required for a valuation  we categorize the entire fair value measurement according to the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement even though we may have also utilized significant inputs that are more readily observable 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
we review the carrying amounts of long lived assets for potential impairment annually  typically during the fourth quarter  or when events occur or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
for example  evaluations are performed when we experience sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates and we do not contemplate recovery in the near future  or when we reclassify property and equipment to assets held for sale or as discontinued operations as prescribed by accounting guidance related to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we determine recoverability by evaluating the undiscounted estimated future net cash flows 
when impairment is indicated  we measure the impairment as the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value 
management considers a number of factors such as estimated future cash flows  appraisals and current market value analysis in determining fair value 
assets are written down to fair value if the concluded current fair value is below the net carrying value 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations about future cash flows generated by our assets and reflect management s assumptions and judgments regarding future industry conditions and their effect on future utilization levels  dayrates and costs 
the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets 
insurance reserves 
our operations are subject to many hazards inherent to the drilling industry  including blowouts  explosions  fires  loss of well control  loss of hole  damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters 
any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death  damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities  suspension of operations  environmental damage and damage to the property of others 
generally  drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer  and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks 
to the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements  we seek protection through insurance 
however  these insurance or indemnification agreements may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above 
moreover  our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible 
based on the risks discussed above  we estimate our liability in excess of insurance coverage and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
reserves related to insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the insurance claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of insured claims could differ significantly from the amounts estimated 
we accrue actuarially determined amounts in our consolidated balance sheet to cover self insurance retentions for workers compensation  employers liability  general liability  automobile liability and health benefits claims 
these accruals use historical data based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims to project future losses 
these estimates and accruals have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid 
as the determination of our liability for insurance claims could be material and is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts  management believes that accounting estimates related to insurance reserves are critical 

table of contents accounting for income taxes 
we are a us company and we operate through our various foreign legal entities and their branches and subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world 
consequently  our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary 
therefore  as a part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  nonresident withholding taxes or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities reported on the consolidated balance sheet 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities  as well as the valuation allowances  we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income  where rigs will be deployed and other matters 
changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances  including as discussed below 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of our net operating loss nol and foreign tax credit ftc carryforwards 
in the event that our earnings performance projections do not indicate that we will be able to benefit from our nol and ftc carryforwards  valuation allowances are established 
we periodically evaluate our ability to utilize our nol and ftc carryforwards and  in accordance with accounting guidance related to accounting for income taxes  will record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense in the period for which an existing estimate changes 
we do not currently provide for us deferred taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are deemed to be permanently reinvested 
if such earnings were to be distributed  we would be subject to us taxes  which may have a material impact on our results of operations 
we periodically review our position and may elect to change our future tax position 
we apply the accounting standards related to uncertainty in income taxes 
this accounting guidance requires that management make estimates and assumptions affecting amounts recorded as liabilities and related disclosures due to the uncertainty as to final resolution of certain tax matters 
because the recognition of liabilities under this interpretation may require periodic adjustments and may not necessarily imply any change in management s assessment of the ultimate outcome of these items  the amount recorded may not accurately reflect actual outcomes 
revenue recognition 
contract drilling revenues and expenses  comprised of daywork drilling contracts and engineering and related project service contracts  are recognized as services are performed and collection is reasonably assured 
for certain contracts  we receive payments contractually designated for the mobilization of rigs and other drilling equipment 
mobilization payments received  and direct costs incurred for the mobilization  are deferred and recognized over the term of the related drilling contract  however  costs incurred to relocate rigs and other drilling equipment to areas in which a contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred 
reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses are recorded as both revenues and direct costs 
for contracts that are terminated prior to the specified term  early termination payments received by us are recognized as revenues when all contractual requirements are met 
revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months 
technical services contracts include engineering  consulting  and project management scopes of work and revenue is typically recognized on a time and materials basis 
construction contract revenues and costs are recognized on a percentage of completion basis utilizing the cost to cost method

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk our international operations expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
there are a variety of techniques to minimize the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  including customer contract payment terms and the possible use of foreign currency exchange rate risk derivative instruments 
our primary foreign currency exchange rate risk management strategy involves structuring customer contracts to provide for payment in both us dollars  which is our functional currency  and local currency 
the payment portion denominated in local currency is based on anticipated local currency requirements over the contract term 
due to various factors  including customer acceptance  local banking laws  other statutory requirements  local currency convertibility and the impact of inflation on local costs  actual foreign currency exchange rate risk needs may vary from those anticipated in the customer contracts  resulting in partial exposure to foreign exchange risk 
fluctuations in foreign currencies typically have not had a material impact on our overall results 
in situations where payments of local currency do not equal local currency requirements  foreign currency exchange rate risk derivative instruments  specifically foreign currency exchange rate risk forward contracts  or spot purchases  may be used to mitigate foreign exchange rate currency risk 
a foreign currency exchange rate risk forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates or to make an equivalent us dollar payment equal to the value of such an exchange 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   we had no open foreign currency exchange rate risk derivative contracts 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates through our fixed rate long term debt 
typically  the fair market value of fixed rate long term debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease and will decrease as prevailing interest rates increase 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where applicable  or based on the present value of expected cash flows relating to the debt discounted at rates currently available to us for long term borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of our million principal amount of senior notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates relative to market interest rates at december  would decrease the fair market value of our senior notes by approximately million 
the company entered into two variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements as a strategy to manage the floating rate risk on the term loan borrowings under the credit agreement 
the two agreements fix the interest rate on a notional amount of million of borrowings at for the period beginning june  and terminating may  the notional amount of the swap agreements decreases correspondingly with amortization of the term loan 
we do not apply hedge accounting to the agreements and  accordingly  the company reports the mark to market change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps in earnings 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized in earnings a million gain and million loss  respectively on interest rate swaps 
impact of fluctuating commodity prices we are exposed to fluctuations that arise from economic or political risks that have  and will  impact underlying commodity prices for natural gas  oil and natural gas oil mixtures 
the company s business is subject to price fluctuations in commodities  and may be impacted by prolonged pricing reductions 
currently  the price of natural gas has been depressed due in some part to high levels of natural gas inventory 
drilling for natural gas has been negatively impacted  however  drilling activity and our rental tools business has remained active with the focus on oil liquids rich shale plays
