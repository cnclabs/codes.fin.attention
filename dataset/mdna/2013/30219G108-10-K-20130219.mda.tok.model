company operations general 
as of december   our us pbm segment operated five high volume automated dispensing home delivery pharmacies  one non automated dispensing home delivery pharmacy  several non dispensing order processing centers  patient contact centers  specialty drug pharmacies and fertility pharmacies  and one non dispensing home delivery pharmacy maintained for business continuity purposes 
at our canadian facilities we provide a full range of integrated pbm services to insurers  third party administrators  plan sponsors and the public sector  to facilitate better health decisions and lower costs 
these services include health claims adjudication and processing services  benefit design consultation  drug utilization review  formulary management and medical and drug data analysis services 
in december  we launched an active pbm service in canada  which included home delivery of maintenance prescription medications from a member contact center and regional dispensing pharmacies four locations 
sales and marketing 
in the united states  our sales managers and directors market and sell pbm services and are supported by a team of client service representatives  clinical pharmacy managers  and benefit analysis consultants 
this team works with clients to make prescription drug use safer and more affordable 
in addition  sales personnel dedicated to our other business operations segment use direct marketing to generate new customers and solidify existing customer relationships 
in canada  marketing and sales efforts are conducted by our staff based in mississauga  ontario and montreal  quebec 
supply chain 
our supply chain pharmacy contracting group is responsible for contracting and administering our pharmacy networks 
to participate in our retail pharmacy networks  pharmacies must meet certain qualifications  including the requirement that all applicable state credentialing and or licensing requirements are being maintained 
pharmacies can contact our pharmacy help desk toll free or access our online pharmacy portal hours a day  days a week  for information and assistance in filling prescriptions for our clients members 
in addition  our fraud  waste abuse services team audits pharmacies in our retail pharmacy networks to determine compliance with the terms of their contracts 
clinical support 
our staff of highly trained pharmacists and physicians provides clinical support for our pbm services 
these healthcare professionals are responsible for a wide range of activities including tracking the drug pipeline  identifying emerging medication related safety issues and notifying physicians  clients  and patients if appropriate  providing drug information services  formulary management  development of utilization management  safety concurrent and retrospective drug utilization review and other clinical interventions  and or contacting physicians  pharmacists or patients 
our clinical staff works closely with the p t committee during the development of our formulary and selected utilization management programs 
the p t committee s goal is to ensure our decisions are evidence based  clinically sound and aligned with the current standard of medical practice 
the p t committee s guidance is designed to ensure decisions are clinically appropriate and not superseded by financial considerations 

table of contents we have a research team whose mission is to conduct timely  rigorous and objective research that supports evidence based pharmacy benefit management 
using pharmacy and medical claims data together with member surveys  the research department conducts studies to evaluate the clinical  economic and member impact of pharmacy benefits 
the release of our annual drug trend report in april marked our nineteenth consecutive year of tracking prescription drug trends 
based on a large sample of our membership  the annual drug trend report examined trends in pharmaceutical utilization and cost as well as the factors that triggered those trends  including behaviors that resulted in wasteful spending in the pharmacy benefit 
in november  we published the inaugural drug trend quarterly  which marked the first quarterly report on drug spend and healthcare trends quarter by quarter 
these reports and the results of our other studies are shared at our annual outcomes conference and are available on our website 
we also present at other client forums  speak at professional meetings and publish in health related journals 
information technology 
our information technology department supports our pharmacy claims processing systems  our specialty pharmacy systems and other management information systems that are essential to our operations 
following the merger  this department began movement toward a consolidated it platform 
uninterrupted point of sale electronic retail pharmacy claims processing is a significant operational requirement for us 
claims for our pbm segment are presently processed in the united states through systems that are managed and operated domestically by internal resources and an outsourced vendor 
canadian claims are processed through systems maintained and operated by ibm in canada and managed by us 
we believe we have substantial capacity for growth in our united states and canadian claims processing facilities 
specialty pharmacy operations are supported by multiple pharmacy systems that are managed and operated internally 
we leverage outsourced vendor services to provide certain disaster recovery services for systems located at our data centers 
for systems not covered by a third party vendor arrangement  such as our specialty pharmacy data centers  our corporate disaster recovery organization manages internal recovery services 
competition there are a number of other pbms in the united states against which we compete 
some of these are independent pbms  such as catamaran and medimpact 
others are owned by managed care organizations such as aetna inc  cigna corporation  optumrx owned by unitedhealthcare and prime therapeutics owned by a collection of blue cross blue shield plans 
some are owned by retail pharmacies  such as caremark owned by cvs 
wal mart stores  inc may continue to engage in certain activities competitive with pbms 
we also compete against adjudicators  such as argus 
some of these competitors may have greater financial  marketing and technological resources 
in addition  other companies may enter into the business and become increasingly competitive as there are no meaningful barriers to entry 
we believe the primary competitive factors in the industry include the ability to contract with retail pharmacies to ensure our retail pharmacy networks meet the needs of our clients and their members  the ability to negotiate discounts on prescription drugs with drug manufacturers  the ability to navigate the complexities of governmental reimbursed business  including medicare part d  the ability to manage cost and quality of specialty drugs  the ability to utilize the information we obtain about drug utilization patterns and consumer behavior to reduce costs for our clients and members  and the level of service we provide 
government regulation and compliance many aspects of our businesses are regulated by federal and state laws and regulations 
since sanctions may be imposed for violations of these laws  compliance is a significant operational requirement and we maintain a comprehensive compliance program 
we believe we are operating our business in substantial compliance with all existing legal requirements material to the operation of our businesses 
there are  however  significant uncertainties involving the application of many of these legal requirements to our business 
in addition  there are numerous proposed healthcare laws and regulations at the federal and state levels  many of which could adversely affect our business or financial position 
we are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislation  regulations or enforcement initiatives may be enacted or taken in the future relating to our business or the healthcare industry in general  or what effect any such legislation  regulations or actions might have on us 
we cannot provide any assurance that federal or state governments will not impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretations of existing laws that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial position and or consolidated cash flow from operations 

table of contents pharmacy benefit management regulation generally 
certain federal and state laws and regulations affect or may affect aspects of our pbm business 
among the laws and regulations that may impact our business are the following federal healthcare reform 
in march  the federal government enacted the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of health reform laws 
the health reform laws include numerous changes to many aspects of the united states healthcare system  including  but not limited to  additional enforcement mechanisms and rules related to healthcare fraud and abuse enforcement activities  health plan coverage mandates  additional rules and obligations for health insurance providers  certain pbm transparency requirements related to the new healthcare insurance exchanges and expanded healthcare coverage for more americans 
while uncertainties still exist regarding implementation of many components of the health reform laws and numerous anticipated regulations are yet to be issued  the health reform laws may impact our business in a variety of ways 
impacts may include  but are not limited to  an increase in utilization of the pharmacy benefit by a newly enrolled population with an unknown risk profile  additional compliance obligations stemming from increased state and federal government involvement in the healthcare marketplace  increased data reporting obligations to support health plan issuers and insurers operating in the healthcare exchanges  the impact of general market reforms that prohibit the use of many factors traditionally used to establish premiums and other adjustments implemented by health plan sponsors and health insurance providers in response to marketplace changes arising in connection with the health reform laws 
medicare part d 
we participate in various ways in the federal medicare part d program created under mma  and its implementing regulations and sub regulatory program guidance the part d rules issued by cms 
through our licensed insurance subsidiaries ie  express scripts insurance company esic  medco containment life insurance company of pennsylvania and medco containment life insurance company of new york  we operate as part d pdp sponsors offering pdp coverage and services to our clients and part d beneficiaries 
we also  through our core pbm business  provide part d related products and services to other pdp sponsors  ma pdps and other employers and clients offering part d benefits to part d eligible beneficiaries 
medicare part b and medicaid 
we participate in the medicare part b program  which covers certain costs for services provided by medicare participating physicians and suppliers and durable medical equipment 
we also participate in many state medicaid programs directly or indirectly through our clients that are medicaid managed care contractors 
we also perform certain medicaid subrogation services for clients  which are regulated by federal and state laws 
anti kickback laws 
subject to certain exceptions and safe harbors  the federal anti kickback statute generally prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully paying or offering any payment or other remuneration to induce a person to purchase  lease  order or arrange for or recommend purchasing  leasing or ordering items including prescription drugs or services reimbursable in whole or in part under medicare  medicaid or another federal healthcare program 
several states also have similar laws  some of which apply similar anti kickback prohibitions to items or services reimbursable by non governmental payors 
sanctions for violating these federal and state anti kickback laws may include criminal and civil fines and exclusion from participation in the federal and state healthcare programs 
the federal anti kickback statute has been interpreted broadly by courts  the office of inspector general oig within the department of health and human services hhs  and administrative bodies 
because of the federal statute s broad scope  federal regulations establish certain safe harbors from liability 
a practice that does not fall within a safe harbor is not necessarily unlawful  but may be subject to scrutiny and challenge 
anti kickback laws have been cited as a partial basis  along with state consumer protection laws discussed below  for investigations and multi state settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with product conversion programs 
there are other anti kickback laws that may be applicable  such as the public contracts antikickback act  the erisa health plan antikickback statute and various other state anti kickback restrictions 
federal civil monetary penalties law 
the federal civil monetary penalty statute provides for civil monetary penalties against any person who gives something of value to a medicare or medicaid program beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary s selection of a particular provider for medicare or medicaid items or services 
under this law  our wholly owned home delivery  specialty pharmacies  infusion pharmacies and home health providers are restricted from offering certain items of value to influence a medicare or medicaid patient s use of services 
the health reform laws also include several new civil monetary provisions  such as penalties for the failure to report and return a known overpayment and failure to grant timely access to the oig under certain circumstances 

table of contents prompt pay laws 
under medicare part d and certain state laws  pbms or certain pbm clients are required to pay retail pharmacy providers within established time periods that may be shorter than existing contracted terms and or via electronic transfer instead of by check 
changes that require faster payment may have a negative impact on our cash flow from operations 
it is anticipated that additional states will consider prompt pay legislation and we cannot predict which states will adopt such legislation or what effect it will have 
false claims act and related criminal provisions 
the federal false claims act the false claims act imposes civil penalties for knowingly making or causing to be made false claims or false records or statements with respect to governmental programs  such as medicare and medicaid  in order to obtain reimbursement or failure to return overpayments 
private individuals may bring qui tam or whistle blower suits against providers under the false claims act  which authorizes the payment of a portion of any recovery to the individual bringing suit 
the health reform laws also amended the federal anti kickback laws to state that any claim submitted to a federal or state healthcare program which violates the anti kickback law is also a false claim under the false claims act 
the false claims act generally provides for the imposition of civil penalties and for treble damages  resulting in the possibility of substantial financial penalties 
criminal statutes that are similar to the false claims act provide that if a corporation is convicted of presenting a claim or making a statement that it knows to be false  fictitious or fraudulent to any federal agency it may be fined 
conviction under these statutes also may result in exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs 
some states have also enacted laws similar to the false claims act which may include criminal penalties  substantial fines  and treble damages 
government procurement regulations 
as discussed above  we have a contract with the dod  which subjects us to all of the applicable federal acquisition regulations and department of defense far supplement which govern federal government contracts 
further  there are other federal and state laws applicable to our dod arrangement and other clients that may be subject to government procurement regulations 
in addition  certain of our clients participate as contracting carriers in the federal employees health benefits program which is administered by the office of personnel management and contains various pbm standards  including pbm transparency standards 
antitrust 
the antitrust laws generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices  dividing markets and boycotting competitors  regardless of the size or market power of the companies involved 
further  antitrust laws generally prohibit other conduct that is found to restrain competition unreasonably  such as certain attempts to tie or bundle services together and certain exclusive dealing arrangements 
erisa regulation 
the employee retirement income security act of erisa regulates certain aspects of employee pension and health benefit plans  including self funded corporate health plans with respect to which we have agreements to provide pbm services 
we believe that the conduct of our business is not generally subject to the fiduciary obligations of erisa 
however  there can be no assurance that the us department of labor the dol  which is the agency that enforces erisa  would not assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by erisa apply to certain aspects of our operations or that courts would not reach such a ruling in private erisa litigation 
in addition to its fiduciary provisions  federal law related to erisa health plans imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received 
these provisions of erisa are similar  but not identical  to the healthcare anti kickback statutes discussed above  although erisa lacks the statutory and regulatory safe harbor exceptions incorporated into the healthcare statutes 
like the healthcare anti kickback laws  the corresponding provisions of erisa are broadly written and their application to particular cases is often uncertain 
employee benefit plans subject to erisa are subject to certain rules  published by the dol  relating to annual form reporting obligations 
the rules include reporting requirements for direct and indirect compensation received by plan service providers such as pbms 
however  on february   the dol issued two frequently asked questions that provide that discount and rebate revenue paid to pbms by drug manufacturers generally need not be reported on a plan s form as indirect compensation  pending further guidance 
on december   the dol held a public hearing regarding the disclosure obligations of service providers to welfare plans under section b of erisa 
at this time  we are unable to predict whether regulations will be issued  the form of such regulations or the possible impact of such changes on our business practices 
state fiduciary legislation 
statutes have been introduced in several states that purport to declare that a pbm is a fiduciary with respect to its clients 
we believe that the fiduciary obligations that such statutes would impose would be similar  but not identical  to the scope of fiduciary obligations under erisa 
to date only two jurisdictions maine and the district of columbia have enacted such a statute 
our trade association  pharmaceutical care management association pcma  filed suits in federal courts in maine and the district of columbia alleging  among other things  that the statutes are preempted by erisa with respect to welfare plans that are subject to erisa 
in  maine s fiduciary law was repealed 
in the district of columbia case  the court granted in part pcma s motion for summary judgment finding that the 
table of contents district of columbia law was preempted by erisa and that decision was affirmed by the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit 
widespread enactment of such statutes could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
consumer protection laws 
most states have consumer protection laws that previously have been the basis for investigations and multi state settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies in connection with drug switching programs 
such statutes have also been cited as the basis for claims against pbms either in civil litigation or pursuant to investigations by state attorneys general 
see part i item legal proceedings for discussion of current proceedings relating to these laws or regulations 
network access legislation 
a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting our ability  or our clients ability  to limit access to a pharmacy provider network or remove a provider from the network 
such legislation may require us or our clients to admit any retail pharmacy willing to meet the plan s price and other terms for network participation any willing provider legislation or may provide that a provider may not be removed from a network except in compliance with certain procedures due process legislation 
we have not been materially affected by these statutes 
certain states have also enacted legislation prohibiting certain pbm clients from imposing additional co payments  deductibles  limitation on benefits  or other conditions conditions on covered individuals utilizing a retail pharmacy when the same conditions are not otherwise imposed on covered individuals utilizing home delivery pharmacies 
however  the legislation requires that the retail pharmacy agree to the same reimbursement amounts and terms and conditions as are imposed on the home delivery pharmacies 
an increase in the number of prescriptions filled at retail pharmacies may have a negative impact on the amount of prescriptions filled through home delivery 
it is anticipated that additional states will consider similar legislation and we cannot predict which states will adopt such legislation or what effect it will have 
legislation affecting plan design 
some states have enacted legislation that prohibits managed care plan sponsors from implementing certain restrictive benefit plan design features  and many states have introduced legislation to regulate various aspects of managed care plans  including provisions relating to the pharmacy benefit 
for example  some states  under so called freedom of choice legislation  provide that members of the plan may not be required to use network providers  but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use non network providers 
other states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit health plans from offering members financial incentives for use of home delivery pharmacies 
legislation has been introduced in some states to prohibit or restrict therapeutic intervention  or to require coverage of all fda approved drugs 
other states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions  and require health plan coverage of specific drugs if deemed medically necessary by the prescribing physician 
such legislation does not generally apply to us directly  but it may apply to certain of our clients  such as managed care organizations and health insurers 
if such legislation were to become widely adopted and broad in scope  it could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable through pharmacy benefit management 
legislation and regulation affecting drug prices 
some states have adopted so called most favored nation legislation providing that a pharmacy participating in the state medicaid program must give the state the best price that the pharmacy makes available to any third party plan 
such legislation may adversely affect our ability to negotiate discounts in the future from network pharmacies 
in addition  federal and state agencies and enforcement officials from time to time investigate pharmaceutical industry pricing practices such as how average wholesale price awp is calculated and how pharmaceutical manufacturers report their best price on a drug under the federal medicaid rebate program 
awp is a standard pricing benchmark published by a third party used throughout the industry  including by us  as a basis for calculating drug prices under contracts with health plans and pharmacies 
first databank and medi span  two third party awp providers  were defendants in a class action suit in federal court in boston alleging a conspiracy in the setting of awp 
the parties entered into a settlement agreement which received final approval by the court  and a roll back of awp prices for many drugs went into effect on september  first databank discontinued publishing awp information in  at which time we transitioned to use of medi span information 
this change did not materially impact our consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows from operations 
additional changes to or discontinuation of the awp standard could alter the calculation of drug prices for federal programs and other contracts that use the standard 
we are unable to predict whether any such changes will actually occur  and if so  whether such changes would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial position and or consolidated cash flow from operations 
further  the federal medicaid rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs reimbursed through state medicaid programs  including through medicaid managed care organizations 
manufacturers of brand name products must provide a rebate equivalent to the greater of a of the average manufacturer price amp paid by retail 
table of contents community pharmacies or by wholesalers for products distributed to retail community pharmacies  or b the difference between amp and the best price available to essentially any customer other than the medicaid program and certain other government programs  with certain exceptions 
we negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers and  in certain circumstances  sell services to drug manufacturers 
investigations have been commenced by certain governmental entities which call into question whether a drug s best price was properly calculated and reported with respect to rebates paid by the manufacturers to the medicaid programs 
we are not responsible for such calculations  reports or payments 
there can be no assurance  however  that our ability to negotiate rebates with  or sell services to  drug manufacturers will not be materially adversely affected by such investigations or regulations in the future 
regulation of financial risk plans 
fee for service prescription drug plans generally are not subject to financial regulation by the states 
however  if a pbm offers to provide prescription drug coverage on a capitated basis or otherwise accepts material financial risk in providing the benefit various state and federal laws may regulate the pbm or its subsidiaries 
such laws may require  among other things that the party at risk establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility 
laws that may apply in such cases include  for example  insurance laws  managed care organization laws and limited prepaid health service plan laws 
these may apply  for example  to our licensed medicare part d subsidiaries ie  esic  medco containment life insurance company of pennsylvania and medco containment life insurance company of new york and other subsidiary insurance businesses 
pharmacy regulation 
our home delivery  specialty and infusion pharmacies are licensed to do business as a pharmacy in the state in which they are located 
most of the states into which we deliver pharmaceuticals have laws that require out of state home delivery pharmacies to register with  or be licensed by  the board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body in the state 
these states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the home delivery service is located  although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state 
we believe we have registered each of our pharmacies in every state in which such registration is required and that we comply in all material respects with all required laws and regulations 
in addition  our pharmacists and nurses are licensed in those states where we believe their activity requires it 
our various pharmacy facilities also maintain certain medicare and state medicaid provider numbers as pharmacies providing services under these programs 
participation in these programs requires our pharmacies to comply with the applicable medicare and medicaid provider rules and regulations  and exposes the pharmacies to various changes the federal and state governments may impose regarding reimbursement methodologies and amounts to be paid to participating providers under these programs 
in addition  several of our pharmacy facilities are participating providers under medicare part d and  as a condition to becoming a participating provider under medicare part d  the pharmacies are required to adhere to certain requirements applicable to the medicare part d program 
other statutes and regulations affect our home delivery  specialty and infusion pharmacy operations  including the federal and state anti kickback laws and the federal civil monetary penalty law described above 
federal and state statutes and regulations govern the labeling  packaging  advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances 
the federal trade commission requires mail order sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising  to stock a reasonable supply of the product to be sold  to fill mail orders within thirty days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate 
the united states postal service has statutory authority to restrict the delivery of drugs and medicines through the mail to a degree that could have an adverse effect on our home delivery operations 
other licensure laws 
many states have licensure or registration laws governing pbms and certain types of managed care organizations and insurance companies  including  but not limited to  preferred provider organizations  third party administrators and companies that provide utilization review services 
the scope of these laws differs from state to state  and the application of such laws to the activities of pbms and insurance companies is often unclear 
we have registered under such laws in those states in which we have concluded that such registration is required either due to our various pbm services or the activities of our licensed insurance subsidiaries 
moreover  we have received full accreditation for urac pharmacy benefit management version standards  which includes quality standards for drug utilization management 
in addition  accreditation agencies requirements for managed care organizations such as the national committee on quality assurance and medicare part d regulations for pdp and ma pdps may affect the services we provide to such organizations 

table of contents legislation regulating pbm activities in a comprehensive manner has been and continues to be considered in a number of states 
in the past  certain organizations  such as the national association of insurance commissioners naic  an organization of state insurance regulators  have considered proposals to regulate pbms and or certain pbm activities  such as formulary development and utilization management 
while the actions of the naic would not have the force of law  they may influence states to adopt model legislation that such organizations promulgate 
certain states have adopted pbm registration and or disclosure laws and we have registered under such laws and are complying with applicable disclosure requirements 
in addition to registration laws  some states have adopted legislation mandating disclosure of various aspects of our financial practices  including those concerning pharmaceutical company revenue  as well as prescribing processes for prescription switching programs and client and provider audit terms 
other states are considering similar legislation  and as more states consider these bills it will be difficult to manage the distinct requirements of each 
fda regulations 
the health reform laws create a regulatory approval pathway for biosimilars alternatively known as generics for biological products and provide that an innovator biological product will be granted years of exclusivity 
at this time  we are unable to fully evaluate the impact of the changes to biosimilars to our business 
our clinical research activities are also subject to a number of complex and stringent regulations affecting the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries 
we offer services relating to the conduct of clinical trials and the preparation of marketing applications and are required to comply with applicable regulatory requirements governing  among other things  the design  conduct  performance  monitoring  auditing  recording  analysis and reporting of these trials 
in the united states  the food and drug administration fda governs these activities pursuant to the agency s good clinical practice regulations 
hipaa and other privacy legislation 
most of our activities involve the receipt or use of confidential health information concerning individuals 
in addition  we use aggregated and anonymized data for research and analysis purposes and  in some cases  provide access to such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and third party data aggregators 
various federal and state laws  including the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  regulate and restrict the use  disclosure and security of confidential health information  and new legislation is proposed from time to time in various states 
the hhs privacy and security regulations included as part of hipaa impose restrictions on the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by certain entities 
the security regulations relate to the security of protected health information when it is maintained or transmitted electronically 
other hipaa requirements relate to electronic transaction standards and code sets for processing of pharmacy claims 
we are required to comply with certain aspects of the privacy  security and transaction standard regulations under hipaa 
as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act signed into law on february   congress adopted the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech 
hitech significantly broadens many of the existing federal and security requirements under hipaa and introduces more vigorous enforcement provisions and penalties for hipaa violations 
like many other companies subject to hipaa  the hitech standards may have significant operational and legal consequences for our business 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with hipaa and other state privacy laws  to the extent they apply to us 
to date  no patient privacy laws have been adopted that materially impact our ability to provide pbm and pharmacy services  but there can be no assurance that federal or state governments will not enact legislation  impose restrictions or adopt interpretations of existing laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
other business operations services 
many of the laws and regulations cited above with respect to our pbm activities also apply with respect to our various other business operations services 
of particular relevance are the federal and state anti kickback laws  state pharmacy regulations and hipaa  which are described above 
in addition  as a condition to conducting our wholesale business  we must maintain various permits and licenses with the appropriate state and federal agencies and we are subject to various wholesale distributor laws that regulate the conduct of wholesale distributors  including  but not limited to  maintaining pedigree papers in certain instances 
service marks and trademarks we  and our subsidiaries  have registered certain service marks including express scripts  medco  curascript  accredo  consumerology  ubc  my rx choices and rationalmed with the united states patent and trademark office 
our rights to these marks will continue so long as we comply with the usage  renewal filings and other legal requirements relating to the usage and renewal of service marks 

table of contents insurance our pbm operations  including the dispensing of pharmaceutical products by our home delivery pharmacies  our other business operations  including the distribution of specialty drugs  and the services rendered in connection with our disease management operations  may subject us to litigation and liability for damages 
commercial insurance coverage is difficult to obtain and cost prohibitive  particularly for certain types of claims 
as such  we may maintain significant self insured retentions when deemed most appropriate and cost effective 
we have established certain self insurance accruals to cover potential claims 
there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain our general  professional or managed care errors and omissions liability insurance coverage in the future or that such insurance coverage  together with our self insurance accruals  will be adequate to cover potential future claims 
a claim  or claims  in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial position and or consolidated cash flow from operations

we note these factors for investors as permitted under the private securities litigation reform act of investors should understand that it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors or risks 
as such  you should not consider either foregoing lists  or the risks identified in our sec filings  to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 
item a risk factors general risk factors we operate in a very competitive industry  which could compress our margins and impair our ability to attract and retain clients 
our failure to effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors in the marketplace could magnify the impact of the competitive environment 
our ability to remain competitive depends upon our continued ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients  as well as cross sell additional products and services to our clients 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is subject to significant market pressures brought about by customer demands  legislative and regulatory developments and other market factors 
competition in the pbm marketplace has historically caused many pbms  including us  to reduce the prices charged for core services while sharing a greater portion of the formulary fees and related revenues received from pharmaceutical manufacturers with clients 
increased client demand for lower pricing  increased revenue sharing  enhanced service offerings and higher service levels create pressure on our operating margins 
we cannot assume that positive trends such as lower drug purchasing costs  increased generic usage  drug price inflation and increased rebates would offset these pressures in the future 
our inability to maintain these positive trends  or failure to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures  could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients which could negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  our clients are well informed and organized and can easily move between us and our competitors 
our client contracts are generally three years and our larger clients generally seek competing bids prior to the expiration of their contract 
these factors together with the impact of the competitive marketplace or other significant differentiating factors between our products and services and those of our competitors may make it difficult for us to attract new clients  retain existing clients and cross sell additional services  which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents in the highly competitive pbm marketplace  the business offerings and reputations of our competitors can have a substantial impact on their ability to attract and retain clients 
in order to remain competitive  we must therefore differentiate our business offerings by innovating and delivering products and services that demonstrate enhanced value to our clients  particularly in response to market changes from public policy 
furthermore  the reputational impact of a service related event  or our failure to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate greater value to our clients  could affect our ability to grow and retain profitable clients which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the managed care industry has undergone periods of substantial consolidation and may continue to consolidate in the future 
if one or more of our managed care clients is acquired  and the acquiring entity is not a client  then we may be unable to retain all or a portion of the acquired business 
if such acquisitions  individually or in the aggregate  are material  they could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the delivery of healthcare related products and services is an evolving and rapidly changing industry 
our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes or trends within the industry could have a negative impact on our ability to compete and adversely affect our business and the results of our operations 
we have designed our business model to compete within the current industry structure 
however  any significant shifts in the structure of the pbm industry would likely affect the environment in which we compete 
our client contracts are generally three years and our pharmaceutical manufacturer and retail contracts are generally non exclusive and terminable on relatively short notice by either party 
consequently  a large intra or inter industry merger  a new entrant or a new business model could alter the industry dynamics and adversely affect our ability to attract or retain clients 
our failure to anticipate or appropriately adapt to changes in the industry could negatively impact our competitive position and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we operate in a complex and rapidly evolving regulatory environment 
changes in applicable laws  rules or regulations  or their interpretation or enforcement  or the enactment of new laws  rules or regulations  could require us to make significant changes to our business operations or result in the imposition of fines or penalties 
further  we may be required to spend significant resources in order to comply with new  changing or existing laws  rules and regulations 
numerous state and federal laws  rules and regulations affect our business and operations and include  among others  the following healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations  which prohibit certain types of payments and referrals as well as false claims made in connection with health benefit programs erisa and related regulations  which regulate many aspects of healthcare plan arrangements state legislation regulating pbms or imposing fiduciary status on pbms consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations network pharmacy access laws  including any willing provider and due process legislation  that affect aspects of our pharmacy network contracts wholesale distributor laws legislation imposing benefit plan design restrictions  which limit how our clients can design their drug benefit plans various licensure laws  such as managed care and third party administrator licensure laws drug pricing legislation  including most favored nation pricing pharmacy laws and regulations state insurance regulations applicable to our insurance subsidiaries privacy and security laws and regulations  including those under hipaa and hitech the medicare prescription drug coverage rules other medicare and medicaid reimbursement regulations  including subrogation the federal patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of the health reform laws federal laws related to our department of defense arrangement federal antitrust laws related to our pharmacy  pharmaceutical manufacturer and client relationships international laws these and other regulatory matters are discussed in more detail under part i item business government regulation and compliance above 

table of contents we believe that we are operating our business in substantial compliance with all existing material legal requirements applicable to us 
however  significant uncertainties exist regarding the application of many of these legal requirements to our business 
from time to time  state and federal law enforcement agencies and regulatory agencies have initiated investigations or litigation involving certain aspects of our business or our competitors businesses and  consequently  we cannot provide any assurance that one or more of these agencies will not interpret or apply these legal requirements in a manner adverse to our business  or  if there is an enforcement action brought against us  that our interpretation would prevail 
in addition  there are numerous proposed healthcare laws  rules and regulations at the federal and state levels  many of which could materially affect aspects of our business or adversely affect our financial results 
we are unable to predict whether additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives relating to our business or the healthcare industry in general will be enacted in the future or what effect  if any  such legislation or regulations may have on us 
due to these uncertainties  we may be required to spend significant resources in connection with any such investigation or litigation or to comply with new or existing laws and regulations 
various governmental agencies have conducted investigations and audits into certain pbm business practices 
many of these investigations and audits have resulted in other pbms agreeing to civil penalties  including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreements 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  such governmental investigations and audits may ultimately have on us or on the pbm industry in general see part i item legal proceedings 
however  we may experience additional government scrutiny and audit activity related to medco s government program services  including audits that accredo health group face or may face which result in payment or offset of prior reimbursement from the government 
the federal court in the district of columbia recently overturned a previously enacted statute by the district of columbia that purports to declare that a pbm is a fiduciary with respect to its clients see part i item business government regulations and compliance state fiduciary legislation 
however  other states are considering but have not yet enacted similar fiduciary statutes  and we cannot predict what effect  if any  these and similar statutes  if enacted  may have on our business and financial results  nor can we predict how other courts may view such laws 
we face risks associated with general economic conditions 
unfavorable and uncertain economic conditions may significantly and adversely affect our businesses and profitability in a variety of respects including our clients  or employers or other benefit providers served by our clients  may reduce or slow the growth of their workforce or covered membership  or may elect to discontinue or diminish provided benefits  which would result in a reduction in the number of members we serve consumers may be less willing or able to incur health care related expenses  whether due to personal economic circumstances  reduction in the level of the health care benefit provided to the consumer or otherwise  which would result in lower than anticipated utilization our clients  or potential clients  may increase demands and expectations with respect to pricing  rebates or service levels including with respect to performance guarantees  which would impact margins  or our ability to obtain new clients or retain existing clients our clients  or potential clients  may be less willing to purchase additional products and services from us  which would impact our financial performance unfavorable and uncertain economic conditions may also cause disruptions in the credit markets which could increase our cost of borrowing or make credit unavailable on acceptable terms to the extent we need additional funds 
such developments may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
policies designed to manage healthcare costs or alter healthcare financing practices may adversely impact our business and our financial results 
from time to time  certain legislative and or regulatory proposals are made which seek to manage the cost of healthcare  including prescription drug cost 
such proposals include single payer government funded healthcare  changes in reimbursement rates  restrictions on access or therapeutic substitution  limits on more efficient delivery channels  taxes on goods and services  price controls on prescription drugs and other significant healthcare reform proposals 
we are unable to predict whether any such proposals will be enacted  or the specific terms thereof 
certain of these proposals  however  if enacted  may adversely impact our business and results of operations 

table of contents the implementation of the health reform laws could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in march  the federal government enacted the health reform laws  which will be gradually phased in through see part i item business government regulation and compliance federal healthcare reform 
the health reform laws contain many provisions that directly or indirectly apply to us  our clients  employers and benefit providers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  healthcare providers and others with whom we do business  including pbm disclosure requirements in the context of medicare part d and the anticipated health benefit exchanges creation of government regulated health benefits exchanges and new requirements for health plans offered by insurance companies  employers and other plan sponsors medical loss ratio requirements  which require insurers to spend a specified percentage of premium revenues on incurred claims or healthcare quality improvements  and require some of our clients to report certain types of pbm proprietary information various health insurance taxes and fees changes to the calculation of average manufacturer price amp of drugs and an increase in the rebate amounts drug manufacturers must pay to states for drugs reimbursed by state medicaid programs  including through medicaid managed care organizations imposition of new fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs expansion of the b drug discount program  which limits the costs of certain outpatient drugs to qualified health centers and hospitals risk adjustments  risk corridors and reinsurance requirements that affect certain of our clients closing of the so called donut hole under medicare part d by lowering beneficiary coinsurance amounts elimination of the tax deduction for employers who receive medicare part d retiree drug subsidy payments mandated changes to client plan designs changes to certain healthcare fraud and abuse laws the scope and ultimate effect of such provisions remains uncertain and we cannot predict the impact that any final implementation will have on our business and results of operations 
if significant changes occur within the pharmacy provider marketplace  or if other issues arise with respect to our pharmacy networks  including the loss of or adverse change in our relationship with one or more key pharmacy providers  our business and financial results could be impaired 
more than  retail pharmacies  which represent over of all united states retail pharmacies  participated in one or more of our networks at december  the ten largest retail pharmacy chains represent approximately of the total number of stores in our largest network 
in certain geographic areas of the united states  our networks may be comprised of higher concentrations of one or more large pharmacy chains 
contracts with retail pharmacies are generally non exclusive and are terminable on relatively short notice by either party 
if one or more of the larger pharmacy chains terminates its relationship with us  or is able to renegotiate terms that are substantially less favorable to us  our members access to retail pharmacies and or our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the entry of one or more large pharmacy chains into the pbm business  in addition to the current pharmacy chain competitors  could increase the likelihood of negative changes in our relationship with such pharmacies 
changes in the overall composition of our pharmacy networks  or reduced pharmacy access under our networks  could have a negative impact on our claims volume and or our competitiveness in the marketplace  which could cause us to fall short of certain guarantees in our contracts with clients or otherwise impair our business or results of operations 
a substantial portion of our revenue is concentrated in certain significant client contracts and our failure to execute on  or other issues arising under  such contracts could adversely affect our financial results 
further  conditions or trends impacting certain of our key clients could result in a negative impact on our financial performance 
as described in greater detail in the discussion of our business in item above see part i item business clients  we have long term contracts with wellpoint  inc wellpoint and the united states department of defense dod 
our top clients  including wellpoint and dod  collectively represented and of our revenue during and  respectively 
on july   medco announced that its pharmacy benefit services agreement with unitedhealth group would not be renewed  although medco continued to provide services under an agreement  which expired on december  a transition agreement will be in place throughout  during which time patients will move in tranches off of the medco platform 
in addition to unitedhealth group  other major clients representing approximately of medco s net revenues for did not renew their contracts with medco for as a result of acquisitions by competitors or transitioning in the normal course of business 

table of contents if one or more of our large clients either terminates or does not renew a contract for any reason or otherwise renews a contract on terms that are less favorable to us  our financial results could be materially adversely affected and we could experience a negative reaction in the investment community resulting in stock price declines or other adverse effects 
if we are not able to replace lost business by generating new sales with comparable operating margins or successfully executing other corporate strategies  our revenues and results of operations could suffer 
in addition  if certain of our key clients are negatively impacted by business conditions or other economic trends  or if such clients otherwise fail to successfully maintain or grow their business  our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
regulatory or business changes relating to our participation in medicare part d  the loss of medicare part d eligible members  or our failure to otherwise execute on our strategies related to medicare part d  may adversely impact our business and our financial results 
certain of our subsidiaries have been approved to function as a part d prescription drug plan pdp sponsor for the purpose of making employer union only group waiver plans available for eligible clients and medco s insurance subsidiaries have been approved by cms to participate in the medicare part d program as a national pdp sponsor that provides direct services to medicare part d eligible members 
we also provide other products and services in support of our clients medicare part d plans or federal retiree drug subsidy 
we have made  and may be required to make further  substantial investments in the personnel and technology necessary to administer our medicare part d strategy and operations 
there are many uncertainties about the financial and regulatory risks of participating in the medicare part d program  and we can give no assurance that these risks will not materially adversely impact our business and results of operations 
certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various contractual and regulatory compliance requirements associated with participating in medicare part d 
as insurers organized and licensed under applicable state laws  these subsidiaries are subject to certain aspects of state laws regulating the business of insurance in all jurisdictions in which they offer pdp services 
as pdp sponsors  certain of our subsidiaries are required to comply with certain federal medicare part d laws and regulations applicable to pdp sponsors 
additionally  the receipt of federal funds made available through the part d program by us  our affiliates or clients is subject to compliance with the part d regulations and established laws and regulations governing the federal government s payment for healthcare goods and services  including the anti kickback laws and the federal false claims act 
if material contractual or regulatory non compliance was to be identified  including  for example  during cms audits or client audits in cases where we service pdp sponsors  recoupment  monetary penalties and or applicable sanctions  including suspension of enrollment and marketing or debarment from participation in medicare programs  could be imposed 
further  the adoption or promulgation of new or more complex regulatory requirements or changes in the interpretation of existing regulatory requirements  in each case  associated with medicare may require us to incur significant compliance related costs which could adversely impact our business and our financial results 
in addition  due to the availability of medicare part d  some of our employer clients may stop providing pharmacy benefit coverage to retirees  instead allowing retirees to choose their own part d plans  which could cause a reduction in utilization for our services 
extensive competition among medicare part d plans could also result in the loss of medicare members by our managed care customers  which would cause a decline in our membership base 
further  medco s part d product offerings require premium payment from members for the ongoing benefit  as well as amounts due from cms  and as a result of the demographics of the calculations  as well as the potential magnitude and timing of settlement for amounts due from cms  these accounts receivable are subject to billing and realization risk in excess of what is experienced in the core pbm business 
like many aspects of our business  the administration of the medicare part d program is complex and any failure to effectively execute the provisions of the medicare part d program may have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 
as discussed above  in march  comprehensive healthcare reform was enacted into federal law through the passage of the health reform laws 
additionally  as described above  the health reform laws contain various changes to the part d program and could have a financial impact on our pdp and our clients demand for our other part d products and services 
we have historically engaged in strategic transactions  including the acquisition of other companies or businesses  and will likely engage in similar transactions in the future 
our failure to effectively execute on such transactions or to integrate any acquired businesses could adversely impact our operating results 
any such transactions will create significant transaction costs and require significant resources and management attention 

table of contents we have historically engaged in strategic transactions  including the acquisition of other companies and businesses 
these transactions typically involve the integration of core business operations and technology infrastructure platforms that require significant management attention and resources 
a failure or delay in the integration process could have a material adverse affect on our financial results 
in addition  such transactions may yield higher operating costs  greater customer attrition or more significant business disruption than anticipated 
further  even if we successfully integrate the business operations  there can be no assurance that a transaction will result in the realization of the expected benefits of synergies  cost savings  innovation and operational efficiencies  or that any realized benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame or an otherwise reasonable period of time 
strategic transactions  including the pursuit of such transactions  often require us to incur significant up front costs 
these costs are typically non recurring expenses related to the assessment  due diligence  negotiation and execution of the transaction 
we may also incur additional costs to retain key employees as well as transaction fees and costs related to executing our integration plans 
although we would generally pursue the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of a business to offset incremental transaction and acquisition related costs over time  this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term  or at all 
difficulty in integrating the business of express scripts  inc and medco or uncertainty around realization of the anticipated benefits of the merger  including the expected amount and timing of cost savings and operating synergies and difficulty in retaining clients of the respective companies  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations as well as a decline of our stock price 
the success of the merger will depend  in part  on our ability to successfully complete the combination of esi and medco  and to fully realize the anticipated benefits from the combination  including synergies  cost savings  innovation and operational efficiencies 
if we are unable to fully achieve these objectives within a reasonable amount of time  or at all  the anticipated benefits may not be fully realized or at all  or may take longer to fully realize than expected and the value of our common stock may decline 
the combination of medco s business and esi s business is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
the ongoing integration of the two companies has resulted  and may continue to result  in challenges  some of which may be material  including  without limitation the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the devotion of management s attention to the completion of the integration managing a larger combined company maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees the continuing integration of two unique corporate cultures the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process retaining existing clients and attracting new clients on profitable terms retaining long term client relationships which comprise a substantial portion of our revenues consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations coordinating geographically separate organizations unanticipated issues in integrating information technology  communications and other systems managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the combined company unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the merger making any necessary modifications to internal financial control standards to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs  decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy 
delays or issues encountered in the ongoing integration process could have a material adverse effect on the revenues  expenses  operating results and financial condition of the combined company and there can be no assurance that we will fully realize these anticipated benefits 
further  we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs in connection with the integration process 
the substantial majority of these costs are non recurring expenses related to the facilities and systems consolidation costs 
we may also incur other unanticipated integration costs as well as costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees and additional costs related to formulating and revising integration plans 
if  among other things  we are unable to fully achieve the expected growth in earnings  or if our operational cost savings estimates are not fully realized  or if the integration costs are greater than expected  the market price of our common stock may decline 
the market price also may decline if we do not fully achieve the perceived benefits of the merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the financial results of the combined company are not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts 

table of contents our debt service obligations reduce the funds available for other business purposes  and the terms and covenants relating to our indebtedness could adversely impact our financial performance and liquidity 
we currently have debt outstanding see summary of indebtedness within note financing  including indebtedness of esi and medco guaranteed by us 
our debt service obligations reduce the funds available for other business purposes 
increases in interest rates on variable rate indebtedness would increase our interest expense and could materially adversely affect our financial results 
at december   we had  million of obligations which were subject to variable rates of interest under our credit agreements 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates of would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately million pre tax  presuming that obligations subject to variable interest rates remained constant 
note  however  that as of december   cash on hand exceeds our variable rate obligations by million 
we are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing  such as the insufficiency of cash flow to meet required debt service payment obligations and the inability to refinance existing indebtedness 
in addition  certain of our debt instruments contain covenants which include limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create or permit liens on assets  and engage in mergers  consolidations or disposals 
the covenants under our credit agreement also include  among others  a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio 
if we fail to satisfy one or more of the covenants under our credit agreement or the senior notes indentures  we would be in default under the credit agreement and or the senior notes indentures  and may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources or otherwise not be able to draw down against our revolving credit facility 
under such circumstances  other sources of capital may not be available to us  or be available only on unattractive terms 
see note financing to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
our ability to conduct operations depends on the security and stability of our technology infrastructure as well as the effectiveness of  and our ability to execute  business continuity plans across our operations 
a failure in the security of our technology infrastructure or a significant disruption in service within our operations could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we maintain  and are dependent on  a technology infrastructure platform that is essential for many aspects of our business operations 
we have many different information systems and have acquired additional information systems as a result of the merger 
it is imperative that we securely store and transmit confidential data  including personal health information  while maintaining the integrity of our confidential information 
however  any failure to protect against a security breach or a disruption in service could negatively impact our reputation and materially adversely impact our business operations and our results of operations 
our technology infrastructure platform requires significant resources to maintain and enhance systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes as well as evolving industry and regulatory standards 
emerging and advanced security threats  including coordinated attacks  require additional layers of security which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations 
from time to time  we may obtain significant portions of our systems related or other services or facilities from independent third parties  which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties failure to adequately perform or protect against a security breach or service disruption 
in the event we or our vendors experience a malfunction in business processes security breaches including from cyber or phishing attacks failure to maintain effective and up to date information systems or otherwise experience unauthorized or non compliant actions by any individual we could incur disruptions to our business operations or negative impacts to patient safety  customer and member disputes  damage to our reputation  exposures to risk of loss  litigation or regulatory violations  increased administrative expenses or other adverse consequences 
we operate dispensing pharmacies  call centers  data centers and corporate facilities that depend on the security and stability of our technology infrastructure 
our technology infrastructure could be disrupted by any number of events including a general failure of the technology  malfunction of business process or a disaster or other catastrophic event 
such disruptions could  temporarily or indefinitely  significantly reduce  or partially or totally eliminate our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to our clients and members 
any such service disruption at these facilities or to this infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents our business operations involve the substantial receipt and use of confidential health information concerning individuals and a failure to adequately protect such information could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
most of our activities involve the receipt or use of protected health information concerning individuals 
in addition  we use aggregated and anonymized data for research and analysis purposes  and in some cases  provide access to such data to pharmaceutical manufacturers and third party data aggregators 
there is currently substantial regulation at the federal and state levels addressing the use  disclosure and security of patient identifiable health information 
at the federal level  the health insurance portability and accountability act of and the regulations issued thereunder collectively hipaa impose extensive requirements governing the transmission  use and disclosure of health information by all participants in health care delivery  including physicians  hospitals  insurers and other payors 
many of these obligations were expanded under the health information and technology for economic and clinical health act the hitech act  passed as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of failure to comply with standards issued pursuant to state or federal statutes or regulations may result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions 
these and future regulations and legislation severely restricting or prohibiting our use of patient identifiable or other information could limit our ability to use information critical to the operation of our business 
if we violate a patient s privacy or are found to have violated any state or federal statute or regulation with regard to confidentiality or dissemination or use of protected health information  we could be liable for significant damages  fines or penalties and suffer reputational harm  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if we lose our relationship with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers  or if the payments made or discounts provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers decline  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we maintain contractual relationships with numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers which provide us with  among other things discounts for drugs we purchase to be dispensed from our home delivery pharmacies rebates based upon distributions of drugs from our home delivery pharmacies and through pharmacies in our retail networks administrative fees for managing rebate programs  including the development and maintenance of formularies which include the particular manufacturer s products access to limited distribution specialty pharmaceuticals if several of these contractual relationships are terminated or materially altered by the pharmaceutical manufacturers or we are otherwise unable to renew such contracts on favorable terms  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  formulary fee programs have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums 
adoption of new laws  rules or regulations or changes in  or new interpretations of  existing laws  rules or regulations  relating to any of these programs could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
changes in industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance 
contracts in the prescription drug industry  including our contracts with retail pharmacy networks and with pbm and specialty pharmacy clients  generally use average wholesale price or awp  which is published by a third party as a benchmark to establish pricing for prescription drugs 
in  first databank  a significant provider of awp information  discontinued publishing such information 
this and other recent events have raised uncertainties as to whether certain third parties will continue to publish awp  which may result in the inability of payors  pharmacy providers  pbms and others in the prescription drug industry to continue to utilize awp as a pricing benchmark as it has previously been calculated 
in the event that awp is no longer published or if we adopt other pricing benchmarks for establishing prices within the industry  we can give no assurance that the short or long term impact of such changes to industry pricing benchmarks will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
legislation and other regulations affecting drug prices are discussed in more detail under part i item business government regulation and compliance legislation and regulation affecting drug prices above 

table of contents pending and future litigation or other proceedings could subject us to significant monetary damages or penalties and or require us to change our business practices  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we are subject to risks relating to litigation  enforcement action  regulatory proceedings  and other similar actions in connection with our business operations  including without limitation the dispensing of pharmaceutical products by our home delivery pharmacies  services rendered in connection with our disease management offering and our pharmaceutical services operations 
a list of the significant proceedings pending against us is included under part i item legal proceedings  including certain proceedings that purport to be class action lawsuits 
these proceedings seek unspecified monetary damages and or injunctive relief 
while we believe these proceedings are without merit and intend to contest them vigorously  we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any such proceedings 
if one or more of these proceedings has an unfavorable outcome  we cannot provide any assurance that it would not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations  including our ability to attract and retain clients as a result of the negative reputational impact of such an outcome 
further  while certain costs are covered by insurance  we may incur uninsured costs that are material to our financial performance in the defense of such proceedings 
commercial liability insurance coverage continues to be difficult to obtain for companies in our business sector  as such insurance can cause unexpected volatility in premiums and or retention requirements dictated by insurance carriers 
we have established certain self insurance accruals to cover anticipated losses within our retained liability for previously reported claims and the cost to defend these claims 
however  there can be no assurance that such accruals will cover actual losses or that general  professional  managed care errors and omissions  and or other liability insurance coverage will be reasonably available in the future or such insurance coverage  together with our self insurance accruals  will be adequate to cover future claims 
a claim  or claims  in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we face significant competition in attracting and retaining talented employees 
further  managing succession and retention for our chief executive officer and other key executives is critical to our success  and our failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our future performance 
we believe that our ability to attract and retain a qualified and experienced workforce is essential to meet current and future goals and objectives 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain such employees or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits 
an inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our failure to adequately plan for succession of our chief executive officer  senior management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
while we have succession plans in place and employment arrangements with certain key executives  these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 
our international operations subject us to certain regulatory  compliance  competition  tax and other risks  which could have a material adverse effect on our business

the government has declined to intervene against defendants and the matter was unsealed on december  the qui tam relator served the third amended complaint on the company on january  relator alleges claims under the federal false claims act and the false claims acts of twenty two states 
the allegations asserted by relator deal primarily with an alleged conspiracy among other defendants to inflate the published average wholesale price awp of certain drugs 
relator generally alleges that esi and medco were aware of the alleged awp inflation and submitted false claims to the government  or caused false claims to be submitted to the government  by failing to disclose the alleged awp inflation to their government health care program customers in violation of an alleged fiduciary duty and or in violation of alleged contractual obligations

we have since combined these two approaches into one methodology used by the company 
this change was made prospectively beginning april  we have not restated the number of claims in prior periods  because the differences are not material 
excluded from the network claims are manual claims and drug formulary only claims where we only administer the client s formulary 
these claims include home delivery  specialty and other claims including a drugs distributed through patient assistance programs  b drugs we distribute to other pbms clients under limited distribution contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers  and c freedomfp claims 
total adjusted claims reflect home delivery claims multiplied by  as home delivery claims typically cover a time period times longer than retail claims 
ebitda from continuing operations is earnings before other income expense  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or alternatively calculated as operating income plus depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is presented because it is a widely accepted indicator of a company s ability to service indebtedness and is frequently used to evaluate a company s performance 
ebitda  however  should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as a measure of operating performance  as an alternative to cash flow  as a measure of liquidity or as a substitute for any other measure computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in addition  our definition and calculation of ebitda may not be comparable to that used by other companies

this measurement is used in concert with net income and cash flows from operations  which measure actual cash generated in the period 
in addition  adjusted ebitda from continuing operations per adjusted claim is a supplemental measurement used by analysts and investors to help evaluate overall operating performance and our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
we have calculated adjusted ebitda from continuing operations excluding certain charges recorded each year  as these charges are not considered an indicator of ongoing company performance 
adjusted ebitda from continuing operations per adjusted claim is calculated by dividing adjusted ebitda from continuing operations by the adjusted claim volume for the period 
this measure is used as an indicator of ebitda from continuing operations performance on a per unit basis  providing insight into the cash generating potential of each claim 
adjusted ebitda from continuing operations and  as a result  adjusted ebitda from continuing operations per adjusted claim  are affected by the changes in claim volumes between retail and mail order  the relative representation of brand name  generic and specialty pharmacy drugs  as well as the level of efficiency in the business 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on july   express scripts  inc esi entered into a definitive merger agreement the merger agreement with medco health solutions  inc medco  which was amended by amendment no 
thereto on november  the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement the merger were consummated on april  for financial reporting and accounting purposes  esi was the acquirer of medco 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations and financial position of esi for the years ended december  and and for the period beginning january  through april  references to amounts for periods after the closing of the merger on april  relate to express scripts 
as the largest full service pharmacy benefit management pbm company  we provide healthcare management and administration services on behalf of our clients  which include managed care organizations  health insurers  third party administrators  employers  union sponsored benefit plans  workers compensation plans and government health programs 
we report segments on the basis of services offered and have determined we have two reportable segments pbm and other business operations 
during the second quarter of  we reorganized our segments to better reflect our structure following the merger 
our other international retail network pharmacy management business which has been substantially shut down as of december  was reorganized from our pbm segment into our other business operations 
during the third quarter of we reorganized our freedomfp line of business from our other business operations segment into our pbm segment 
our integrated pbm services include network claims processing  home delivery services  patient care and direct specialty home delivery to patients  benefit plan design consultation  drug utilization review  formulary management  drug data analysis services  distribution of injectable drugs to patient homes and physician offices  bio pharma services  fertility services to providers and patients and fulfillment of prescriptions to low income patients through manufacturer sponsored patient assistance programs 
through our other business operations segment  we provide services including distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to providers and clinics and scientific evidence to guide the safe  effective  and affordable use of medicines 
revenue generated by our segments can be classified as either tangible product revenue or service revenue 
we earn tangible product revenue from the sale of prescription drugs by retail pharmacies in our retail pharmacy networks and from dispensing prescription drugs from our home delivery and specialty pharmacies 
service revenue includes administrative fees associated with the administration of retail pharmacy networks contracted by certain clients  medication counseling services and certain specialty distribution services 
tangible product revenue generated by our pbm and other business operations segments represented of revenues for the year ended december  as compared to for both of the years ended december  and merger transaction as a result of the merger on april   medco and esi each became wholly owned subsidiaries of express scripts and former medco and esi stockholders became owners of stock in express scripts  which is listed for trading on the nasdaq stock exchange 
upon closing of the merger  former esi stockholders owned approximately of express scripts and former medco stock holders owned approximately 
recent developments as previously noted in esi s annual report on form k for the year ended december   the contract with walgreen co 
walgreens expired on december  prior to expiration of the contract with walgreens  esi provided a full array of tools and resources to help members efficiently transfer prescriptions to other conveniently located pharmacies 
as announced on july   express scripts and walgreens reached a multi year pharmacy network agreement with rates and terms under which walgreens participates in the broadest express scripts retail pharmacy network available to new and existing clients  as of september  express scripts helped to provide a smooth transition for those plan sponsors who include walgreens pharmacies in their network 
executive summary and trend factors affecting the business our results in compared to prior periods continue to be driven by the addition of medco to our book of business on april  the merger impacted all components of our financial statements  including our revenues  expenses and profits  the consolidated balance sheet and claims volumes 
our results reflect the ability to successfully achieve synergies throughout the 
table of contents merger 
our results also reflect the successful execution of our business model  which emphasizes the alignment of our financial interests with those of our clients through greater use of generics and low cost brands  home delivery and specialty pharmacies 
we also benefited from better management of ingredient costs through renegotiation of supplier contracts and increased competition among generic manufacturers  as well as a higher generic fill rate in compared to in for esi on a stand alone basis 
we anticipate that the ongoing macroeconomic environment specifically  the prolonged stagnant business climate and weak employment outlook  among other factors will have a negative impact on our results in future quarters  with lower membership and utilization resulting from in group attrition at the client level and continued low utilization rates generally 
we will also face challenges due to various marketplace forces which affect pricing and plan structures  as well as increasing client demands and expectations 
however  we expect that the ongoing positive trends in our business  including lower drug purchasing costs  increased generic usage and greater productivity associated with the merger  will continue to more than offset these negative factors  allowing us to continue to generate growth and improvements in our results of operations in the future  although such negative factors will temper our growth rate over the near term 
while we continue to expect positive performance in the future  we also expect variability in claims volume due to  among other things  the timing of the departure of unitedhealth group 
this variability  coupled with other contractual revenue streams  may cause our performance trends quarter over quarter to differ relative to historical periods 
as the regulatory environment evolves  we plan to continue to make significant investments designed to keep us ahead of the competition 
these projects include preparation for changes to medicare regulations and the implementation of patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health reform laws 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates and assumptions are based upon a combination of historical information and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies described below represent those policies that management believes most impact our consolidated financial statements  are important for an understanding of our results of operations or require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
this should be read in conjunction with note summary of significant accounting policies and with the other notes to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets accounting policy goodwill and intangible asset balances arise primarily from the allocation of the purchase price of businesses acquired based on the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
we determine reporting units based on component parts of our business one level below the segment level 
our reporting units represent businesses for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly by segment management 
in the fourth quarter of  we elected to early adopt new guidance related to goodwill impairment testing  which simplifies how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance provides an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount macroeconomic conditions  such as a deterioration in general economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and or other developments in equity and credit markets industry and market considerations  such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates cost factors  such as an increase in pharmaceuticals  labor or other costs overall financial performance  such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue other relevant entity specific events  such as material changes in management or key personnel events affecting a reporting unit  such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets  including acquisitions and dispositions impacts of a sustained decrease in the share price  considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers 
table of contents the examples noted above are not all inclusive  and the company shall consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
if we perform step  the measurement of possible impairment is based on a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets 
impairment losses  if any  would be determined based on the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  using discount rates that reflect the inherent risk of the underlying business 
we would record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill resulting from this calculation 
this valuation process involves assumptions based upon management s best estimates and judgments that approximate the market conditions experienced for our reporting units at the time the impairment assessment is made 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  earnings and cash flow projections  discount rate and peer company comparability 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in such estimates 
due to the significant level of change this fiscal year as a result of the merger  we did not perform a qualitative assessment for any of our reporting units  and instead began with step of the goodwill impairment analysis  as allowed under the new guidance 
no impairment charges were recorded as a result of our annual impairment test 
however  an impairment charge of million was recorded in the third quarter of associated with our subsidiary europa apotheek venlo bv eav  based on a change in business environment related to an adverse court ruling by the german high court in august and the expected disposal of eav as a result of the ruling 
no other goodwill impairment charges existed for any of our other reporting units at december  or december  other intangible assets include  but are not limited to  customer contracts and relationships  deferred financing fees and trade names 
deferred financing fees are recorded at cost 
customer contracts and relationships are valued at fair market value when acquired using the income method 
customer contracts and relationships related to our year contract with wellpoint  inc wellpoint under which we provide pharmacy benefit management services to wellpoint and its designated affiliates the pbm agreement are being amortized using a modified pattern of benefit method over an estimated useful life of years 
customer contracts and relationships intangible assets related to our acquisition of medco are being amortized using a modified pattern of benefit method over an estimated useful life of to years  respectively 
all other intangible assets  excluding legacy esi trade names which have an indefinite life  are amortized on a straight line basis  which approximates the pattern of benefit  over periods from to years for customer related intangibles  years for trade names and to years for other intangible assets see note goodwill and other intangibles 
in the third quarter of  upon reassessment of the carrying values of assets and liabilities of eav based on the events described above  we recorded impairment charges associated with this line of business totaling million of intangibles assets 
the write off of intangible assets was comprised of customer relationships with a carrying value of million gross value of million less accumulated amortization of million and trade names with a carrying value of million gross value of million less accumulated amortization of million 
eav was subsequently sold on december  in the third quarter of  as a result of our plan to dispose of our polymedica corporation liberty line of business  an impairment charge totaling million was recorded against intangible assets to reflect fair value 
the write down was comprised of customer relationships with a carrying value of million gross value of million less accumulated amortization of million and trade names with a carrying value of million million less accumulated amortization of million 
this charge was allocated to these assets on a pro rata basis using the carrying values as of september  liberty was subsequently sold on december  factors affecting estimate the fair values of reporting units  asset groups or acquired businesses are measured based on market prices  when available 
when market prices are not available  we estimate fair value using the income approach and or the market approach 
the income approach uses cash flow projections which require inputs and assumptions that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment 
we base our fair values on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable 
however  actual results may differ from those projections  and those differences may be material 
the key assumptions included in our income approach include  but are not limited to  earnings growth rates  discount rates and inflation rates 
assessment of these factors could be impacted by internal factors and or external economic conditions 
we performed various sensitivity analyses on the key assumptions which did not indicate any potential impairment 

table of contents contractual guarantees accounting policy many of our contracts contain terms whereby we make certain financial and performance guarantees  including the minimum level of discounts or rebates a client may receive  generic utilization rates and various service guarantees 
these clients may be entitled to performance penalties if we fail to meet a financial or service guarantee 
actual performance is compared to the guarantee for each measure throughout the period  and accruals are recorded if we determine that our performance against the guarantee indicates a potential liability 
these estimates are adjusted to actual when the guarantee period ends and we have either met the guaranteed rate or paid amounts to clients 
factors affecting estimate the factors that could impact our estimates of guarantees expense and guarantees payable are as follows differences between the rates guaranteed by us to clients and rates contracted by us with pharmacies in our retail networks or with pharmaceutical manufacturers for drugs dispensed from our home delivery pharmacies changes in drug utilization patterns  including the mix of brand and generic drugs as well as utilization of our home delivery pharmacy allowance for doubtful accounts accounting policy we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to estimated uncollectible receivables 
this estimate is based on the current status of each customer s receivable balance 
factors affecting estimate we record allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer and historical experience 
our estimate could be impacted by changes in economic and market conditions as well as changes to our customers financial condition 
self insurance accruals accounting policy we record self insurance accruals based upon estimates of the aggregate liability of claim costs in excess of our insurance coverage which are probable and estimable 
accruals are estimated using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and our historical experience 
the majority of these claims are legal claims and our liability estimate is primarily related to the cost to defend these claims 
we do not accrue for settlements  judgments  monetary fines or penalties until such amounts are probable and estimable 
under authoritative financial accounting standards board fasb guidance  if the range of possible loss is broad  and no amount within the range is more likely than any other  the liability accrual is based on the lower end of the range 
factors affecting estimate self insurance accruals are based on management s estimates of the costs to defend legal claims 
we do not have significant experience with certain of these types of cases 
as such  differences between actual costs and management s estimates could be significant 
actuaries do not have a significant history with the pbm industry 
therefore  changes to assumptions used in the development of these accruals can affect net income in a given period 
in addition  changes in the legal environment and the number and nature of claims could impact our estimate 
the self insurance accruals and changes in those estimates have not been material to the financial statements for the periods presented herein 
rebate accounting accounting policy we administer esi s rebate program through which we receive rebates and administrative fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers 
the portion of rebates and administrative fees payable to clients is estimated based on historical and or anticipated sharing percentages 
in connection with the merger  we are administering medco s market share performance rebate program 
estimates for rebates receivable are accrued monthly based on the terms of the applicable contract  historical data  and current utilization 
these estimates are adjusted to actual when amounts are paid to clients 

table of contents factors affecting estimate the factors that could impact our estimates of rebates  rebates receivable and rebates payable are as follows differences between estimated allocation percentages and actual rebate allocation percentages drug patent expirations changes in drug utilization patterns income taxes accounting policy deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
we evaluate tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
factors affecting estimate the factors that could impact our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows likelihood of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position assumed interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions other accounting policies we consider the following information about revenue recognition policies important for an understanding of our results of operations prescription drug revenues revenues from the sale of prescription drugs by retail pharmacies are recognized when the claim is processed 
when we independently have a contractual obligation to pay our network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to our clients members  we act as a principal in the arrangement and we include the total prescription price ingredient cost plus dispensing fee we have contracted with these clients as revenue  including member co payments to pharmacies 
revenues from dispensing prescriptions from our home delivery and specialty pharmacies are recorded when prescriptions are shipped 
these revenues include the co payment received from members of the health plans we serve 
at the time of shipment  we have performed substantially all of our obligations under the customer contracts and do not experience a significant level of reshipments or returns 
rebates and administrative fees when we merely administer a client s network pharmacy contracts to which we are not a party and under which we do not assume credit risk  we earn an administrative fee for collecting payments from the client and remitting the corresponding amount to the pharmacies in the client s network 
in these transactions  drug ingredient cost is not included in our revenues or in our cost of revenues 
gross rebates and administrative fees earned for the administration of our rebate programs  performed in conjunction with claims processing services provided to clients  are recorded as a reduction of cost of revenue and the portion of the rebate payable to customers is treated as a reduction of revenue 
when we earn rebates and administrative fees in conjunction with formulary management services  but do not process the underlying claims  we record rebates received from manufacturers  net of the portion payable to customers  in revenue 
we distribute pharmaceuticals in connection with our management of patient assistance programs and earn a fee from the manufacturer for administrative and pharmacy services for the delivery of certain drugs free of charge to doctors for their low income patients 

table of contents we earn a fee for the distribution of consigned pharmaceuticals requiring special handling or packaging where we have been selected by the pharmaceutical manufacturer as part of a limited distribution network 
medicare prescription drug program our revenues include premiums associated with our medicare prescription drug program pdp risk based product offerings 
these products involve prescription dispensing for beneficiaries enrolled in the centers for medicare medicaid services cms sponsored medicare part d prescription drug program medicare part d prescription drug benefit 
in addition to pdp premiums  there are certain co payments and deductibles the cost share due from members based on prescription orders by those members  some of which are subsidized by cms in cases of low income membership 
our cost of revenues includes the cost of drugs dispensed by our home delivery pharmacies or retail network for members covered under our medicare pdp product offerings and is recorded at cost as incurred 
specialty revenues discounts and contractual allowances related to our specialty revenues are estimated based on historical collections over a recent period for the sales that are recorded at gross amounts 
the percentage is applied to the applicable accounts receivable balance that contains gross amounts for each period 
any differences between the estimates and actual collections are reflected in operations in the period payment is received or as a better estimate becomes available 
differences may result in the amount and timing of revenues for any period if actual performance varies from estimates 
allowances for returns are estimated based on historical return trends 
the discounts  contractual allowances  allowances for returns and any differences between estimates and actual amounts do not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations we maintain a pbm segment consisting of our pbm operations and specialty pharmacy operations  which includes providing fertility services to providers and patients  and an other business operations segment  which consists of distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to providers and clinics and scientific evidence to guide the safe  effective and affordable use of medicines

results of operations for the years presented below have been restated for comparability 
prior to the merger  esi and medco historically used slightly different methodologies to report claims  however  we believe the differences between the claims reported by esi and medco would not be material had the same methodology been applied 
we have since combined these two approaches into one methodology that is used by the company 
this change was made prospectively beginning april  we have not restated the number of claims in prior periods  because the differences are not material
