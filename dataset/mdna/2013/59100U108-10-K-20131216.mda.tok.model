item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
changes in economic and political conditions could adversely affect the company s earnings  as the company s borrowers ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing the company s loans decline 
the company s success depends  to a certain extent  upon economic and political conditions  local and national  as well as governmental monetary policies 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  changes in interest rates  money supply and other factors beyond the company s control may adversely affect the company s asset quality  deposit levels and loan demand and  therefore  the company s earnings 
because the company has a significant amount of real estate loans  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral 
among other things  adverse changes in the economy  including but not limited to the current economic downturn  may also have a negative effect on the ability of the company s borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on the company s earnings 
in addition  the vast majority of the company s loans are to individuals and businesses in the company s market area 
consequently  any economic decline in the company s market area could have an adverse impact on the company s earnings 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s earnings depend substantially on the company s interest rate spread  which is the difference between i the rates we earn on loans  securities and other earning assets  and ii the interest rates we pay on deposits and other borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
as market interest rates rise  we will have competitive pressures to increase the rates we pay on deposits  which may result in a decrease of the company s net interest income 
conversely  if interest rates fall  yields on loans and investments may fall 
because a significant portion of the company s deposit portfolio is in non interest bearing accounts  such a decrease in rates would likely result in a decrease in the company s net interest income 
although the bank continues to monitor its interest rate risk exposure and has undertaken additional analyses and implemented additional controls to improve its core earnings from interest income  the bank can provide no assurance that its efforts will appropriately protect the bank in the future from interest rate risk exposure

table of contents the company operates in a highly regulated environment  and changes in laws and regulations to which we are subject may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company and the bank operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the occ  the fdic  the bureau  and the federal reserve 
as of july   the company has been supervised by the federal reserve  and the bank has been supervised by the occ and the fdic 
see item business regulation herein 
in addition  the company and the bank are subject to regulations promulgated by the bureau 
applicable laws and regulations may change and the enforcement of existing laws and regulations may vary when actions are evaluated by these new regulators  and there is no assurance that such changes will not adversely affect the company s business 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including but not limited to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution  the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution s allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of restrictions on activities  regulatory policy  regulations  legislation  or the evaluation of the bank s and the company s efforts with respect to achieving compliance with the consent orders  could have a material impact on the company s operations 
it is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted  or the effect that such passage or adoption will have on the banking industry or the company 
changes in technology could be costly 
the banking industry is undergoing technological innovation at a fast pace 
to keep up with its competition  the company needs to stay abreast of innovations and evaluate those technologies that will enable it to compete on a cost effective basis 
this is especially true with respect to mps 
the cost of such technology  including personnel  has been high in both absolute and relative terms and additional funds continue to be used to enhance existing management information systems 
there can be no assurance  given the fast pace of change and innovation  that the company s technology  either purchased or developed internally  will meet or continue to meet the needs of the company 
risks related to the company s business the entry into the consent orders has imposed certain restrictions and requirements upon the company and the bank and we cannot predict the possibility of future regulatory action 
satisfaction of the requirements of the orders is subject to the ongoing review and supervision of the occ with respect to the bank and the federal reserve with respect to the company 
the bank and the company have and expect to continue to expend significant management and financial resources to address areas that were cited in the orders  such matters include but are not limited to capital preservation and enhancement commensurate with the bank s risk profile  improvement of core earnings from interest income  management and board oversight of the bank  risk management and internal controls  compliance management  and bank secrecy act compliance 
there can be no assurance that our regulators will ultimately determine that we have met all of the requirements of the orders to their satisfaction 
if our regulators believe that we have not made sufficient progress in complying with the orders  they could seek to impose additional regulatory requirements  operational restrictions  enhanced supervision and or civil money penalties 
if any of these measures is imposed in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to raise additional capital

table of contents the compliance obligations and restrictions on our interest payments and dividends under the ots consent orders may have an adverse effect on us and preclude payments to holders of our securities 
among other things  the consent orders require the company and bank to submit to the occ or the federal reserve  as appropriate  various management and compliance plans and programs to address the matters initially identified in the ots supervisory directives as well as plans for enhancing company and bank capital  and require ots non objection for company cash dividends  distributions  share repurchases  payments of interest or principal on debt and incurrence of debt 
as indicated  satisfaction of the requirements of the orders is subject to the ongoing review and supervision of our regulators 
there can be no assurance our regulators will ultimately determine that we have met all of the requirements of the orders to their satisfaction or that we will continue to receive non objection to our payment of dividends and interest or any other activity for which non objection or approval is required 
additional resources  both economic and in terms of personnel  will continue to be expended by the company and the bank in their endeavors to achieve compliance 
see business regulation bank supervision and regulation ots consent orders and related matters which is included in item of this annual report on form k 
the occ and federal reserve are our primary banking regulators and we may not be able to comply with applicable banking regulations and the terms of the consent orders to their satisfaction 
our regulators have broad discretionary powers to enforce banking laws and regulations and may seek to take informal or formal supervisory action if they deem such actions are necessary or required or if they believe that our efforts with respect to the consent orders are insufficient 
if imposed in the future  corrective steps could result in additional regulatory requirements  operational restrictions  enhanced supervision and or civil money penalties 
additional resources  both economic and in terms of personnel  will continue to be expended by the company and the bank in their endeavors to achieve full compliance 
contracts with third parties  some of which are material to the company  may not be renewed  may be renegotiated on terms that are not as favorable  may not be fulfilled or could be subject to cancellation by regulatory authorities 
the bank has entered into numerous contracts with third parties with respect to the operations of its business 
in some instances  the third parties provide services to the bank and mps  in other instances  the bank and mps provides products and services to such third parties 
were such agreements not to be renewed by the third party or were such agreements to be renewed on terms less favorable  such actions could have an adverse material impact on the bank  its mps division  and  ultimately  the company 
similarly  were one of these parties unable to meet their obligations to us for any reason including but not limited to bankruptcy  computer or other technological interruptions or failures  personnel loss or acts of god  we may need to seek alternative service providers 
we may not be able to secure alternate service providers  and even if we do  the terms with such alternate providers may not be as favorable as those currently in place 
in addition  were we to lose any of our important third service providers  it could cause a material disruption in our own ability to service our customers  which also could have an adverse material impact on the bank  its mps division  and ultimately the company 
moreover  were the disruptions in our ability to provide services significant  this could negatively affect the perception of our business  which could result in a loss of confidence and other adverse effects on our business 

table of contents we are currently in negotiations for a five year agreement with our existing third party service provider whose data processing operations are important to us  the agreement is expected to cover core processing services for transaction and item processing needs 
our current contract with this third party expires on february   and we were recently informed that the service provider has requested significant monetary compensation that we are disputing in its entirety 
we can offer no assurance that current contract negotiations will result in a contract for services past that date 
if we are unable to reach agreement  we could be subject to the consequences described above 
for a discussion of the monetary compensation being requested by such service provider  see the legal proceedings disclosure contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which is included in part ii
