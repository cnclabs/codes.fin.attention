item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  we experienced continued decline in the performance of our electronic materials segment  specifically our solar pastes  metal powders and surface finishing products businesses  which ultimately led us to begin exploring strategic options for the solar pastes business during the third quarter of we also 
table of contents experienced weak demand in europe  with our color and glass performance materials  performance coatings and polymer additives segments the most significantly impacted 
on february   we sold assets related to solar pastes and exited the product line 
to further address the challenges that we are facing  in the second quarter of  we initiated cost cutting initiatives to reduce the cost structure of the performance coatings business in europe 
we have also taken action to improve electronic materials results through actions to restructure the management team and significantly reduce operating costs 
additionally  we have announced cost savings initiatives that are aimed at driving efficiencies across our global footprint 
we expect to achieve million to million of cost savings in and more than million in through a combination of improved manufacturing efficiency and consolidation of certain global commercial and support functions 
for the year ended december   ferro s net loss was million  compared with net income of million in  and net loss attributable to common shareholders was million  compared with net income attributable to common shareholders of million in our total segment operating income for was million  compared with million in during  we incurred charges totaling million related to impairment of the goodwill and certain property  plant and equipment in our electronic materials reporting unit  as well as impairments of real estate assets related to certain idled facilities in europe 
further  we initiated restructuring activities that resulted in total charges of million and primarily consisted of actions related to our performance coatings business in europe and certain corporate actions  including exiting the lease of our corporate aircraft 
outlook for the full year  we expect organic sales volume growth to approximate global gdp growth  with sales revenue growth expected to track below volume growth primarily due to expected changes in foreign currency rates  including the euro 
the expected improvements in the company s cost structure are expected to be partially offset by inflationary pressures on expenditures 
the sale of assets related to our solar pastes business during the first quarter of is expected to improve segment operating income in electronic materials by approximately million annually compared with results

table of contents restructuring and impairment charges increased significantly in compared with the primary driver of the impairment charges taken against goodwill and property  plant and equipment in the current year was the decline in profitability of our solar pastes business and the related impact on the forecast for electronic materials 
in addition to the impacts related to electronic materials  we continued to aggressively liquidate our portfolio of real estate related to idled facilities that is classified as held for sale  which drove incremental impairment charges during the year 
our idled facilities are principally located in europe  which continued to experience difficult economic conditions 
idled assets in france  the netherlands and the us were sold in the restructuring charges incurred in primarily related to our performance coatings business in europe and the disposal of the leased corporate aircraft

table of contents operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million from to cash flows decreased million due to lower net income  million due to the return of precious metal deposits  and million due to changes in accounts payable 
these decreases were mostly offset by increases of million in non cash restructuring and impairment charges  million due to changes in deferred taxes  million due to changes in inventories  million due to changes in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  and million due to changes in other receivables and other current assets 
we recorded a net loss in compared with net income in  primarily as a result of restructuring and impairment charges and additional income tax expense 
restructuring and impairment charges included a million impairment of goodwill associated with the electronic materials segment and a million impairment of long lived assets  primarily in the electronic materials segment 
these impairments were the result of reduced forecasts for future profitability in electronic materials 
in addition  impairment charges included a million impairment to reduce the value of assets held for sale  primarily properties and buildings related to manufacturing sites that were closed as part of earlier restructuring activities 
we also recorded a charge of million to reserve for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
the reserve for the deferred tax assets was primarily driven by the significant impairment charges that were incurred during inventories  other receivables and other current assets  and accounts payable increased in as a result of higher production activity driven by improved customer demand compared with the final months of they decreased in due to lower production activity driven by lower customer demand compared with the final months of the return of precious metal deposits provided million of cash in due to additional credit lines not requiring collateral

these fees were million for at december   we had on hand precious metals owned by participants in our precious metals consignment program of million  measured at fair value based on market prices for identical assets and net of credits 
we also process precious metals owned by our customers 
the consignment agreements under our precious metals program involve short term commitments that typically mature within to days of each transaction and are typically renewed on an ongoing basis 
as a result  the company relies on the continued willingness of financial institutions to participate in these arrangements to maintain this source of liquidity 
on occasion  we have been required to deliver cash collateral 
while no deposits were outstanding at december   we may be required to furnish cash collateral in the future based on the quantity and market value of the precious metals under consignment and the amount of collateral free lines provided by the financial institutions 
the amount of cash collateral required is subject to review by the financial institutions and can be changed at any time at their discretion  based in part on their assessment of our creditworthiness 
bank guarantees and standby letters of credit

we have taken a variety of actions to enhance liquidity and to ensure short term covenant compliance  including ongoing restructuring activities  suspension of dividend payments on our common stock in  and sale of assets related to our solar pastes business in our level of debt  debt service requirements  and ability to access credit markets could have important consequences to our business operations and uses of cash flows 
the company has recently accessed credit markets for the following transactions 
in  we issued senior notes  which mature in  and entered into the credit facility  which matures in in  we entered into several international accounts receivable sales programs 
in  we extended our domestic asset securitization facility and amended the credit facility to provide additional operating flexibility 
our credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior notes contain a number of restrictive covenants  including those described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k 
these covenants include customary operating restrictions that limit our ability to engage in certain activities  including additional loans and investments  prepayments  redemptions and repurchases of debt  and mergers  acquisitions and asset sales 
we are also subject to customary financial covenants under our credit facilities  including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
these covenants under our credit facilities restrict the amount of our borrowings  reducing our flexibility to fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives 
these facilities and our senior notes are described in more detail in capital resources and liquidity under item and in note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k 
the most critical of these ratios is the leverage ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with our maximum leverage ratio covenant of x as our actual ratio was x  providing million of ebitda  as defined within our credit facilities and senior notes indenture  cushion on the leverage ratio 
our leverage ratio covenants decrease in to x 
to the extent that economic conditions in key markets deteriorate or we are unable to meet our business projections and ebitda falls below approximately million for rolling four quarters  based on reasonably consistent debt levels with those as of december   could make us unable to maintain compliance with our leverage ratio covenant  in which case  our lenders could demand immediate payment of outstanding amounts and we would need to seek alternate financing sources to pay off such debts and to fund our ongoing operations 
such financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
we may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
difficulties experienced in global capital markets could affect the ability or willingness of counterparties to perform under our various lines of credit  receivable sales programs  forward contracts  and precious metals program 
these counterparties are major  reputable  multinational institutions  all having investment grade credit ratings  except for one  which is not rated 
accordingly  we do not anticipate counterparty default 
however  an interruption in access to external financing could adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition 
we assess on an ongoing basis our portfolio of businesses  as well as our financial and capital structure  to ensure that we have sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our strategic objectives 
as part of this process  from time to time we evaluate the possible divestiture of businesses that are not critical to our core strategic objectives and  where appropriate  pursue the sale of such businesses 
a reduced forecast for our solar pastes sales and a 
table of contents diminished outlook for our future opportunities in the solar market led to our decision to sell assets related to our solar pastes business in we also evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our strategic position 
generally  we publicly announce divestiture and acquisition transactions only when we have entered into definitive agreements relating to those transactions 
the company s aggregate amount of contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below thereafter totals dollars in thousands short term debt  long term debt     interest     operating lease obligations    purchase commitments    taxes  retirement and other postemployment benefits  long term debt excludes unamortized discounts on the convertible notes and imputed interest and executory costs on capitalized lease obligations 
interest represents only contractual payments for fixed rate debt 
purchased commitments are non cancelable contractual obligations for raw materials and energy 
we have not projected payments past due to uncertainties in estimating the amount and period of any payments 
we have million in gross liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits  including million of accrued interest and penalties  that are not included in the above table since we cannot reasonably predict the timing of cash settlements with various taxing authorities 
the funding amounts are based on the minimum contributions required under our various plans and applicable regulations in each respective country 
we have not projected contributions past due to uncertainties regarding the assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions 
critical accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
we consider the policies discussed below to be more critical than other policies because their application requires our most subjective or complex judgments 
these estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize sales typically when we ship goods to our customers and when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss has passed to our customers 

table of contents in order to ensure the revenue recognition in the proper period  we review material sales contracts for proper cut off based upon the business practices and legal requirements of each country 
for sales of products containing precious metals  we report revenues gross along with their corresponding cost of sales to arrive at gross profit 
we record revenues this way because we act as the principal in the transactions into which we enter 
restructuring and cost reduction programs in recent years  we have developed and initiated several restructuring programs across a number of our business segments with the objectives of leveraging our global scale  realigning and lowering our cost structure  and optimizing capacity utilization 
the programs are primarily associated with north america  europe and asia pacific 
management continues to evaluate our businesses  and therefore  there may be additional provisions for new plan initiatives  as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded  as payments are made or actions are completed 
restructuring charges include both termination benefits and asset writedowns 
we estimate accruals for termination benefits based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions  local legal requirements  projected final service dates  and salary levels 
we also analyze the carrying value of long lived assets and record estimated accelerated depreciation through the anticipated end of the useful life of the assets affected by the restructuring or record an asset impairment 
in all likelihood  this accelerated depreciation will result in reducing the net book value of those assets to zero at the date operations cease 
while we believe that changes to our estimates are unlikely  the accuracy of our estimates depends on the successful completion of numerous actions 
changes in our estimates could increase our restructuring costs to such an extent that it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
other events  such as negotiations with unions and work councils  may also delay the resulting cost savings 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment each year using a measurement date of october st or more frequently in the event of an impairment indicator 
we estimate the fair values of the reporting units associated with these assets using the average of both the income approach and the market approach  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of the reporting units fair values  unless facts and circumstances exist that indicate more representative fair values 
the income approach uses projected cash flows attributable to the reporting units over their useful lives and allocates certain corporate expenses to the reporting units 
we use historical results  trends and our projections of market growth  internal sales efforts and anticipated cost structure assumptions to estimate future cash flows 
using a risk adjusted  weighted average cost of capital  we discount the cash flow projections to the measurement date 
the market approach estimates a price reasonably expected to be paid by a market participant in the purchase of similar businesses 
if the fair value of any of the reporting units were determined to be less than its carrying value  we would proceed to the second step and obtain comparable market values or independent appraisals of its assets to determine the amount of any impairment 
the significant assumptions and ranges of assumptions we used in our impairment analyses of goodwill at july   and october  and  were as follows significant assumptions weighted average cost of capital residual growth rate our estimates of fair value can be adversely affected by a variety of factors 
reductions in actual or projected growth or profitability at our reporting units due to unfavorable market conditions or significant increases in cost structure could lead to the impairment of any related goodwill 
additionally  an increase in inflation  interest rates or the risk adjusted  weighted average cost of capital could also lead to a reduction in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units and therefore lead to the impairment of goodwill 

table of contents in the third quarter of  deterioration in our forecast for our electronic materials reporting unit indicated that an interim assessment of the goodwill recorded in the electronic materials segment was necessary 
we performed the analysis required under asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  and concluded under step that the carrying value of the electronic materials reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
we estimated this fair value using the average of both the income approach and the market approach 
further analysis under step resulted in the goodwill with a carrying amount of million being written down to a preliminary estimate of its implied fair value of million  with the impairment charge of million being included in restructuring and impairment charges in our statements of operations for the third quarter of during the fourth quarter  we finalized our estimate of the implied fair value of the electronic materials goodwill and concluded that it was zero  resulting in an incremental impairment charge of million 
based on our annual impairment test performed as of october   the fair values of the remaining reporting units tested for impairment exceeded the carrying values of the respective reporting units by amounts ranging from to at the measurement date 
the lowest headroom relates to the performance pigments and colors reporting unit  which had a goodwill balance of million at december  a future potential impairment is possible for any of these reporting units if actual results are materially less than forecasted results 
some of the factors that could negatively affect our cash flows and  as a result  not support the carrying values of our reporting units are new environmental regulations or legal restrictions on the use of our products that would either reduce our product revenues or add substantial costs to the manufacturing process  thereby reducing operating margins  new technologies that could make our products less competitive or require substantial capital investment in new equipment or manufacturing processes  and substantial downturns in economic conditions 
income taxes the breadth of our operations and complexity of income tax regulations require us to assess uncertainties and make judgments in estimating the ultimate amount of income taxes we will pay 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid 
the final income taxes we pay are based upon many factors  including existing income tax laws and regulations  negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  outcomes of tax litigation  and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international income tax audits 
the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to our income tax assets and liabilities in the future 
deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we adjust our deferred income tax assets and liabilities for changes in income tax rates and income tax laws when changes are enacted 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets 
the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income  our ability to carry back or carry forward net operating losses and credits to offset tax liabilities in a prior year  as well as successful implementation of various tax strategies to generate tax where net operating losses or credit carryforwards exist 
in evaluating our ability to realize the deferred income tax assets  we rely principally on the reversal of existing temporary differences  the availability of tax planning strategies  and forecasted income 
we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax positions is subject to management s assessment of relevant risks  facts  and circumstances existing at that time 
we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured based on a more likely than not threshold and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on the tax return 
to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes  the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
we report tax related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 

table of contents derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and precious metal prices 
the accounting for derivative financial instruments can be complex and can require significant judgment 
generally  the derivative financial instruments that we use are not complex  and observable market based inputs are available to measure their fair value 
we do not engage in speculative transactions for trading purposes 
financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  expose us to counterparty credit risk for non performance 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we enter into these derivative financial instruments with major  reputable  multinational financial institutions 
accordingly  we do not anticipate counter party default 
we continuously evaluate the effectiveness of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges to ensure that they are highly effective 
in the event the hedge becomes ineffective  we discontinue hedge treatment 
except as noted below  we do not expect any changes in our risk policies or in the nature of the transactions we enter into to mitigate those risks 
our exposure to interest rate changes arises from our debt agreements with variable market interest rates 
to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt  we had entered into interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps effectively converted a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
in  in conjunction with repayment of our remaining outstanding term loans  we settled these swaps 
we manage foreign currency risks in a wide variety of foreign currencies principally by entering into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions arising from international trade 
our objective in entering into these forward contracts is to preserve the economic value of non functional currency cash flows 
our principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling  the japanese yen  and the chinese yuan 
we mark these forward contracts to fair value based on market prices for comparable contracts and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other income or expense from foreign currency transactions 
precious metals primarily silver  gold  platinum and palladium represent a significant portion of raw material costs in our electronic materials products 
we also use precious metals in our color and glass performance materials products 
when we enter into a fixed price sales contract at the customer s request to establish the price for the precious metals content of the order  we also enter into a forward purchase arrangement with a precious metals supplier to completely cover the value of the precious metals content 
our current precious metal contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
we also purchase portions of our energy requirements  including natural gas and electricity  under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of cost changes 
our current energy contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor defined benefit plans in the us and many countries outside the us  and we also sponsor retiree medical benefits for a segment of our salaried and hourly work force within the us the us pension plans represent approximately of pension plan assets  of benefit obligations and of net periodic pension cost 
during the third quarter of  we changed our method of recognizing defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits expense 
historically  we recognized actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortized them into our operating results over the remaining service period of plan participants to the extent such gains and losses were outside of a corridor 
we have elected to recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur 
while the historical method 
table of contents of recognizing expense was acceptable  we believe the new method is preferable because it results in recognition in our operating results of actuarial gains and losses as they arise 
this change will improve the transparency in our operating results by more quickly recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on plan obligations  investments and assumptions 
these gains and losses are generally only measured annually as of december and  accordingly  will be recorded during the fourth quarter of each year 
in accordance with asc topic  accounting changes and error corrections  all prior periods presented in this annual report on form k have been adjusted to apply the new method retrospectively 
the assumptions we use in actuarial calculations for these plans have a significant impact on benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs 
we meet with our actuaries annually to discuss key economic assumptions used to develop these benefit obligations and net periodic costs 
we determine the discount rate for the us pension and retiree medical plans based on a bond model 
using the pension plans projected cash flows  the bond model considers all possible bond portfolios that produce matching cash flows and selects the portfolio with the highest possible yield 
these portfolios are based on bonds with a quality rating of aa or better under either moody s investor services  inc or standard poor s rating group  but exclude certain bonds  such as callable bonds  bonds with small amounts outstanding  and bonds with unusually high or low yields 
the discount rates for the non us plans are based on a yield curve method  using aa rated bonds applicable in their respective capital markets 
the duration of each plan s liabilities is used to select the rate from the yield curve corresponding to the same duration 
for the market related value of plan assets  we use fair value  rather than a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over several years 
we calculate the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year for defined benefit plans as the weighted average of the expected return for the target allocation of the principal asset classes held by each of the plans 
in determining the expected returns  we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return 
the company consults with and considers the opinion of its actuaries in developing appropriate return assumptions 
our target asset allocation percentages are fixed income  equity  and other investments for us plans and fixed income  equity  and other investments for non us plans 
in  investment returns on average plan assets were approximately within us plans and within non us plans 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment allocation and performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
all other assumptions are reviewed periodically by our actuaries and us and may be adjusted based on current trends and expectations as well as past experience in the plans 
the following table provides the sensitivity of net annual periodic benefit costs for our pension plans  including a us nonqualified retirement plan  and the retiree medical plan to a basis point decrease in both the discount rate and asset return assumption basis point decrease in discount rate basis point decrease in asset return assumption dollars in thousands us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans total 
table of contents the following table provides the rates used in the assumptions and the changes between and change discount rate used to measure benefit cost us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans discount rate used to measure benefit obligations us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans expected return on plan assets us pension plans non us pension plans our overall net periodic benefit cost for all defined benefit plans decreased million to million in from million in the change is the result of higher returns on plan assets than in the prior year and current year curtailment gains  which more than offset higher actuarial losses than in the prior year from a larger reduction in the discount rate in than in for  assuming expected returns on plan assets and no actuarial gains or losses  we expect our overall net periodic benefit cost to be a benefit of approximately million  compared with a cost of approximately million in on a comparable basis 
the change is the result of higher expected returns from a larger asset base and lower interest costs due to lower discount rates  partially offset by the effects of curtailment gains 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined utilizing the first in  first out fifo method 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of inventories based primarily upon their age  but also upon assumptions of future usage in production  customer demand and market conditions 
inventories have been reduced to the lower of cost or realizable value by allowances for slow moving or obsolete goods 
if actual circumstances are less favorable than those projected by management in its evaluation of the net realizable value of inventories  additional write downs may be required 
slow moving  excess or obsolete materials are specifically identified and may be physically separated from other materials  and we rework or dispose of these materials as time and manpower permit 
environmental liabilities our manufacturing facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate 
the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future 
we expense these recurring costs as they are incurred 
while these costs may increase in the future  they are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we also accrue for environmental remediation costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount 
we determine the timing and amount of any liability based upon assumptions regarding future events 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
we adjust these liabilities periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 

table of contents impact of newly issued accounting pronouncements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k for a discussion of accounting standards we recently adopted or will be required to adopt 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to instruments that are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and costs of raw materials and energy 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises from our debt portfolio 
we manage this risk by controlling the mix of fixed versus variable rate debt after considering the interest rate environment and expected future cash flows 
our objective is to limit variability in earnings  cash flows and overall borrowing costs caused by changes in interest rates  while preserving operating flexibility 
we operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions expose us to gains and losses arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled 
we manage this risk by entering into forward currency contracts that substantially offset these gains and losses 
we are subject to cost changes with respect to our raw materials and energy purchases 
we attempt to mitigate raw materials cost increases through product reformulations  price increases  and other productivity improvements 
we enter into forward purchase arrangements with precious metals suppliers to completely cover the value of the precious metals content of fixed price sales contracts 
these agreements are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market  and had purchase commitments totaling million at december  in addition  we purchase portions of our natural gas and electricity requirements under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of these costs 
these energy contracts are designated as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market  and had purchase commitments totaling million at december  the notional amounts  carrying amounts of assets liabilities  and fair values associated with our exposure to these market risks and sensitivity analyses about potential gains losses resulting from hypothetical changes in market rates are presented below dollars in thousands variable rate debt and utilization of asset securitization program change in annual interest expense from change in interest rates fixed rate debt carrying amount fair value change in fair value from increase in interest rate change in fair value from decrease in interest rate foreign currency forward contracts notional amount carrying amount and fair value change in fair value from appreciation of us dollar change in fair value from depreciation of us dollar
