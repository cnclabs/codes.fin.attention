item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis addresses the results of our operations which are based upon the consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis also addresses our liquidity and financial condition and other matters 
general we are a diversified  global medical device company focused on developing and delivering innovative repair and regenerative solutions to the spine and orthopedic markets 
our products are designed to address the lifelong bone and joint health needs of patients of all ages  helping them achieve a more active and mobile lifestyle 
we design  develop  manufacture  market and distribute medical equipment used principally by musculoskeletal medical specialists for orthopedic applications 
our main products are invasive and minimally invasive spinal implant products and related human cellular and tissue based products hct p products  non invasive regenerative stimulation products used to enhance bone growth and the success rate of spinal fusions and to treat non union fractures  external and internal fixation devices used in fracture repair  limb lengthening and bone reconstruction 
our products also include bone cement and devices for removal of bone cement used to fix artificial implants 
our results and financial condition include the following items of significance spine revenues  which includes spine regenerative stimulation  increased million in or versus led by our spine regenerative biologics and spine regenerative stimulation 
our orthopedics revenue decreased or million dollars during as compared to foreign currency accounted for of the decrease with the rest due to a decrease in sales in our external fixation which was partially offset by an increase in revenues from orthopedic regenerative biologics 
an increase in gross profit margin from in to in which was primarily the result of operational efficiency initiatives and a favorable product and geographical sales mix 
a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales as compared to prior period is primarily a result of the reduction in charges related to us government resolutions 
please refer to the explanation provided in our liquidity and capital resources section of the management discussion and analysis 
we have administrative and training facilities in the us  brazil  and italy and manufacturing facilities in the us  the united kingdom  and italy 
the spine gbu directly distributes products in the us the orthopedics gbu directly distributes products in the us  united kingdom  italy  germany  switzerland  austria  france  belgium  brazil  and puerto rico 
in several of these and other markets  we also distribute our products through independent distributors 
our consolidated financial statements include the financial results of our company and our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and entities over which we have control 
all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
all balance sheet accounts  except shareholders equity  are translated at year end exchange rates  and revenue and expense items are translated at weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income and expense 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency financial statements are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity 
our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are not significantly impacted by seasonality trends 
however  sales associated with products for elective procedures appear to be influenced by the somewhat lower level of such procedures performed in the late summer 
in addition  we do not believe our operations will be significantly affected by inflation 
however  in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
our objective is to limit the impact of such movements on earnings and cash flows 
in order to achieve this objective  we seek to balance non dollar denominated income and expenditures 
during the year  we have used derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency fluctuation exposures 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of operating results is based upon the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of these statements necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to contractual allowances  doubtful accounts  inventories  potential intangible assets and goodwill impairment  income taxes  and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized as income in the period in which title passes and the products are delivered 
revenues exclude any value added or other local taxes  intercompany sales and trade discounts 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
royalty revenues are recognized when the royalty is earned 
for stimulation that is prescribed by a physician  we recognize revenue when the product is placed on or implanted in and accepted by the patient 
for domestic spinal implant and hct p products  revenues are recognized when the product has been utilized and a confirming purchase order has been received from the hospital 
for sales to commercial customers  including hospitals and distributors  revenues are recognized at the time of shipment unless contractual agreements specify that title passes on delivery 
revenues for inventory delivered on consignment are recognized as the product is used by the consignee 
we derive a significant amount of revenues in the us from third party payors  including commercial insurance carriers  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and governmental payors such as medicare 
amounts paid by these third party payors are generally based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates 
these revenues are recorded at the expected or pre authorized reimbursement rates  net of any contractual allowances or adjustments 
certain billings are subject to review by the third party payors and may be subject to adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances the process for estimating the ultimate collection of accounts receivable involves significant assumptions and judgments 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to reserves for doubtful accounts and the establishment of contractual allowances 
accounts receivable are analyzed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of both reserves for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
revisions in allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within sales and marketing expenses 
revisions to contractual allowances are recorded as an adjustment to net sales 
in the judgment of management  adequate allowances have been provided for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
our estimates are periodically tested against actual collection experience 
inventory allowances we write down our inventory for inventory excess and obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory is analyzed to assess the adequacy of inventory excess and obsolescence provisions 
reserves for excess and obsolescence provisions are recorded as adjustments to cost of goods sold 
if conditions or assumptions used in determining the market value change  additional inventory adjustments in the future may be necessary 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc topic property  plant and equipment  intangible assets with definite lives are tested for impairment if any adverse conditions exist or change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if an impairment indicator exists  we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
for purposes of the recoverability test  we group our intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset asset group  we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified 

table of contents we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows that we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining the estimated future cash flows associated with intangible assets  we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset asset group 
the use of alternative assumptions  including estimated cash flows  discount rates  and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment 
we test goodwill and certain indefinite lived trademarks at least annually for impairment 
we test more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
these indicators include  among others  declines in sales  earnings or cash flows  or the development of a material adverse change in the business climate 
we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
we have identified two reporting units  which are consistent with our reporting segments  spine and orthopedics 
the company is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the company determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than the carrying amount 
the company assesses the qualitative factors while performing the step zero analysis 
in performing the annual impairment test  which is performed during the fourth quarter or more frequently when impairment indicators exist  after assessing the qualitative factors in step zero  we may be required to utilize the two step approach prescribed 
the first step requires a comparison of each reporting unit s carrying value to the fair value of the respective unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated  entirely or predominantly  using an income based approach 
this income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow dcf  which estimates after tax cash flows on a debt free basis  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in performing a dcf calculation  we are required to make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows  terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates and no impairments were recorded during and since december   there has been no event or adverse business trend that would suggest that goodwill or our indefinite lived intangibles have been impaired or that an interim test should be performed 
subsequent to the sale of breg  the company had no indefinite lived intangibles 

table of contents litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  we are parties to or targets of lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  patent and intellectual property  health and safety and employment and healthcare regulatory matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
these lawsuits  investigations or proceedings could involve a substantial number of claims and could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and customer base 
although we maintain various liability insurance programs for liabilities that could result from such lawsuits  investigations or proceedings  we are self insured for a significant portion of such liabilities 
we accrue for such claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the process of analyzing  assessing and establishing reserve estimates for these types of claims involves judgment 
changes in the facts and circumstances associated with a claim could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the period that reserve estimates are revised 
we believe that present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  but we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or our present insurance coverage 
tax matters we and each of our subsidiaries are taxed at the rates applicable within each of their respective jurisdictions 
the composite income tax rate  tax provisions  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise 
further  certain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to our other subsidiaries or provide administrative  marketing and support services to our other subsidiaries 
these intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax rates 
the tax authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatments under residency criteria  transfer pricing provisions  or other aspects of their respective tax laws  which could affect our composite tax rate and provisions 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc income taxes which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that  on an evaluation of the technical merits  the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
we reevaluate our income tax positions periodically to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances  changes in or interpretations of tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
we include interest related to tax issues as part of income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements 
we record any applicable penalties related to tax issues within the income tax provision

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations 
primary exposures include changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
these exposures can vary sales  cost of sales  costs of operations and the cost of financing and yields on cash and short term investments 
we use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage these risks 
however  our risk management policy does not allow us to hedge positions we do not hold nor do we enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had a currency swap in place to minimize foreign currency exchange risk related to a million million translated at the december  foreign exchange rate intercompany note 
as of december  the fair value of the currency swap was approximately million and is recorded in other long term assets 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our term loan facility and revolving credit facility  which bear interest at floating rates based on libor plus an applicable borrowing margin or at a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable borrowing margin 
therefore  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
as of december   million of the revolving credit facility is at the libor rate plus a margin of 
this margin is adjusted based upon the measurement of the consolidated leverage ratio of the company and its subsidiaries with respect to the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters 
as of december   our effective interest rate on our credit facilities was 
based on the balance outstanding under the credit facilities as of december   an immediate change of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate on the revolving credit facility would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million annually 
our foreign currency exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro  great britain pound  mexican peso and brazilian real 
we are subject to cost of goods currency exposure when we produce products in foreign currencies such as the euro or great britain pound and sell those products in us dollars 
we are subject to transactional currency exposures when foreign subsidiaries or the company itself enter into transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency 
as of december   we had an un hedged intercompany receivable denominated in euro of approximately million million 
we recorded a foreign currency gain during the year ended december  of million related to this un hedged long term intercompany balance in accumulated other comprehensive income during  which resulted from the weakening of the euro against the us dollar during the period
