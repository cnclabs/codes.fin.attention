significant events and recent developments on june   we completed the acquisition of prairiefyre software inc prairiefyre  a global provider of contact center  business analytics  and workforce optimization software and services 
as a highly integrated original equipment manufacturer oem  substantially all of prairiefyre s revenue was derived from mitel and our channel partners 
the acquisition provides us with a cornerstone development platform to address increasing demand for cloud based contact center solutions 
our net cash cost for the acquisition was approximately million for a equity ownership interest in prairiefyre 
in march  we completed the sale of our datanet business  which distributed a wide variety of third party telephony and data products and related services 
as a result  the operating results of datanet have been 
table of contents reported as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations up to the time of sale and the assets of datanet have been classified as held for sale at april  in february  we completed a refinancing of our senior long term debt by entering into new credit agreements  consisting of an undrawn million first lien revolving credit facility  a million first lien term loan and an million second lien term loan the new credit facilities 
proceeds of million from the new credit facilities net of original issue discount of million  along with million of cash on hand  were used to repay the remaining million outstanding first lien term loan and million outstanding second lien term loan the prior credit facilities  as well as fees and expenses related to the transaction 
during fiscal  we announced changes to our senior management team 
in march  joseph vitalone joined mitel as executive vice president  sales for the americas region 
mr 
vitalone replaced philip keenan  who departed mitel in february in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded special charges and restructuring costs of million for diligence costs incurred during exclusive negotiations with a third party relating to a potential acquisition 
we have concluded that we will not proceed with the transaction  but we continue to be subject to a non disclosure agreement 
in the second quarter of fiscal  in response to macro economic concerns  we implemented a restructuring plan that included the termination of approximately employees as well as the closure of excess facilities 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we reorganized our business into three business units mcs  netsolutions and other 
we believe this new organizational structure has simplified our business and allows us to better serve our customers and to better focus our research and development expenses 
in conjunction with reorganizing our business  our mcs business unit focused on a channel partner go to market business model beginning in may as a result our mcs channel partner revenue increased in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  which more than offset an expected decline in our direct business 
operating results our revenues for the year ended april  were million  as compared to million for the year ended april  the decrease in revenues is due primarily to lower sales from our mcs segment as a result of a challenging macro economic environment in most regions 
our operating income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as lower revenues were partially offset by an increased gross margin percentage and lower operating expenses  as described below 
trends ip based communications businesses continue to migrate from legacy telephony networks to ip based environments  which can address their voice  data  video and business applications requirements within a single converged network 
the transition to ip based communications solutions provides significant benefits to businesses  including enhanced workforce productivity  reduced infrastructure costs and the creation of highly functional applications that can be distributed easily 
we have invested heavily and continue to innovate in ip based solutions and therefore believe we are well positioned to benefit from this transition 
the evolution to converged ip based networks has given rise to two important trends the transition from hardware based to software based communications solutions and the ability to deliver integrated ucc applications 
the transition to software based communications solutions provides operational cost benefits and the ability to integrate communications with other business processes and applications 
ucc allows business customers to move beyond basic fixed telephony and disparate communications tools toward integrated multi media communications and collaboration between users  wherever they may be located 
ucc includes the integrated use of various media and messaging  such as voice  video and data 
our leadership in software based 
table of contents communications solutions has provided us with the foundation for continued innovation in ip based communications and ucc 
we believe our comprehensive  integrated ip based communications offering provides our customers with significant flexibility  cost efficiency and enhanced employee productivity as they transition to converged ip based environments and ucc 
virtualization corporate data centers have experienced a significant increase in the use of virtualization technology as a strategy to reduce capital and operating expenses as well as providing improved business continuity solutions through new high availability architectures 
we believe that businesses can significantly benefit from the virtualization of ucc and ip based communications solutions by allowing these products to integrate fully with the data center infrastructure and related management processes and eliminating telecommunication specific infrastructure and processes 
our early investment in this technology across our product portfolio allows our customers to benefit using either our products on vmware or with our multi instance communications director micd product 
hosted  cloud based solutions smes are increasingly interested in outsourcing management of their communications requirements through managed service offerings 
managed services may include equipment  installation  ongoing support  network services  or various professional services 
managed service offerings allow businesses to focus on their core expertise and  in some cases  substitute what would otherwise be a large capital expenditure for a predictable operating expense 
we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from this trend through our hosted cloud based ucc offerings from netsolutions  which are delivered as retail  wholesale and infrastructure as a service iaas offers 
virtualization technology is also serving as the base for cloud computing solutions enabling businesses to benefit from data center outsourcing and data center elasticity where data center resources and associated services may be acquired and dispensed with  depending on a business s needs 
mobility as employees increasingly work from outside the office  they require technology tools that enable them to work efficiently  regardless of their location 
as a result  it environments are being challenged to be mobile device agnostic while continuing to provide a secure  yet seamless experience for employees and administrators 
our investments in various fixed mobile convergence solutions as well as virtualization and hosted  cloud based solutions allow us to provide solutions in an increasingly mobile environment

sources of revenues and expenses the following describes our sources of revenues and expenses 
revenues and cost of revenues mcs our mcs segment generates revenues principally from the sale of integrated communications solutions to business customers 
our distribution network includes value added resellers  or channel partners  and a direct sales staff  or direct channel 
the typical system includes a combination of ip phones  switches and software applications 
our core software essential software is integrated with hardware and function together to deliver the essential functionality of the integrated system product 
we also sell additional software non essential software which provides increased features and functions  but is not essential to the overall functionality of the integrated system products 
the initial purchase is generally a multiple element arrangement  where the customer bundles together the hardware  essential software  non essential software and an initial period of post contract support 
in addition  the initial purchase may include installation  training and up to five years of post contractual support 
after the initial purchase  if the enterprise customer increases end users and or functionality  it may add more hardware  software  and related post contractual support by purchasing them separately 
we generally recognize hardware and software revenue when delivery has occurred  in accordance with the contract terms 
revenue related to post contract support  including technical support and unspecified when and if available software upgrades  is recognized ratably over the contract term 
in a transaction containing a sales type lease  hardware and software revenues are recognized at the present value of the payments allocated to the hardware and software lease elements 
we regularly sell the rental payments from sales type leases to financial institutions with the cash flow streams discounted at prevailing rates at the time of sale 
gains or losses resulting from the sale of net rental payments from leases are recorded as net sales within mcs revenues 
our standard hardware warranty period extends up to months from the date of sale 
at the time product revenues are recognized  an accrual for estimated warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenues based on prior claims experience 
we offer various cooperative marketing programs to assist our channel partners in marketing our products 
allowances for these programs are recorded as marketing expenses at the time of shipment based on contract terms and prior experience 
mcs cost of revenues is comprised of product and service costs

special charges and restructuring costs special charges and restructuring costs are primarily driven by restructuring activities  product line exits and other charges undertaken to improve our operational efficiency as well as acquisition related costs 
restructuring costs consist primarily of workforce reduction costs  lease termination obligations and asset write offs 
we reassess the accruals at each reporting period to reflect changes in the timing or amount of estimated restructuring and termination costs on which the original estimates were based 
new restructuring accruals or reversals of previous accruals are recorded in the period of change 
acquisition related costs consist primarily of diligence costs undertaken for potential acquisitions 
acquisition related costs are expensed in the period incurred 
comparability of periods our functional currency is the us dollar and our consolidated financial statements are prepared with us dollar reporting currency using the current rate method 
assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date while revenue and expense items are translated at the monthly average exchange rates for the relevant period 
the resulting unrealized gains and losses have been included as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment which is reported as other comprehensive income 
changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period can have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position  which may also make the comparability of periods complex

gross margin percentages in the netsolutions segment and other segment were relatively unchanged in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect gross margins to remain consistent in the near term  however  margins could be higher or lower as a result of a number of factors including variations in revenue mix  competitive pricing pressures  foreign currency movements in regions where revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  utilization of our professional services personnel and efficiencies in installing our products  and global economic conditions  among other factors

liquidity and capital resources in february we completed a refinancing of our long term senior debt by entering into new credit agreements  consisting of an undrawn million first lien revolving credit facility  a million first lien term loan and an million second lien term loan the new credit facilities 
proceeds of million from the new credit facilities net of original issue discount of million  along with million of cash on hand  were used to repay the remaining million outstanding first lien term loan and million outstanding second lien term loan the prior credit facilities  as well as million of fees and expenses related to the transaction 
in addition  prior to the refinancing  we repaid million  primarily related to excess cash flow repayments under the prior credit facilities 
as of april   our liquidity consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents of million and an undrawn million revolving credit facility that matures in february at april   we had million outstanding under our credit facilities  consisting of a first lien term loan and second lien term loan  and had stated common share capital of million 
subsequent to year end  in june  we acquired prairiefyre for a net cash cost of approximately million  as described in significant events and recent developments under the overview section above 
we have a defined benefit pension plan in place for a number of our past and present employees in the united kingdom 
the plan has been closed to new members since in november  the remaining members ceased earning credit for new service 
at april   the plan had an unfunded pension liability of million 
the contributions to fund the benefit obligations under this plan are based on actuarial valuations  which themselves are based on certain assumptions about the long term operations of the plan  including the life expectancy of members  the performance of the financial markets and interest rates 
the amount of annual employer contributions required to fund the pension deficit annually is determined every three years  in accordance with uk regulations and is based on a calendar year 
in june  the company s annual funding requirement to fund the pension deficit for fiscal year was determined to be million million and increases at an annual rate of for the fiscal years and in fiscal year  we contributed million to the uk pension plan for current service and deficit funding 
we expect to contribute million million in fiscal for deficit funding as members no longer earn current service 
our first lien term loan requires quarterly principal repayments of million  with the remaining amount repayable at maturity 
our second lien term loan is repayable in full at maturity 
we are also required to make annual principal repayments on the first lien term loan and  once the first lien term loan has been fully repaid  on 
table of contents the second lien term loan based on a percentage of excess cash flow as defined in the new credit facilities 
the annual excess cash flow repayments are required to be paid within days of the end of the fiscal year 
the first annual excess cash flow payment is required be paid within days of the end of fiscal the proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt  and proceeds from the sale of company assets  may also be required to be used  in whole or in part  to make mandatory prepayments under the first lien credit facilities and  once the first lien credit facilities are repaid  under the second lien credit facility 
the new credit facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants  including a periodic financial reporting requirements  b a maximum ratio of consolidated total debt net of up to million of unrestricted cash to the trailing twelve months earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio  as specified in the new credit agreements  c limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary indebtedness and also the borrowers themselves  d limitations on liens  e limitations on investments  and f limitations on the payment of dividends 
the maximum leverage ratio under the first lien credit agreement applies for the period ending april  and for all fiscal quarters thereafter and is as follows fiscal quarters ending maximum consolidated leverage ratio april  through january  april  through january  april  through january  april  and thereafter the following table presents our maximum leverage ratio and our actual leverage ratio under the new credit agreements 
period ending maximum leverage ratio actual leverage ratio april  our source for cash in the future is expected to come from existing operations and our undrawn revolving credit facility 
our most significant source of cash from operations is expected to be the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and the sale of future rental payments associated with sales leases which we provide to our customers to finance their purchases as part of our managed services offering program 
the primary use of cash is expected to include funding operating expenses  working capital  capital expenditures  debt service  income taxes and other contractual obligations 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity to support our business operations for the next months 
however  we may elect to seek additional funding prior to that time 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance of our products 
additional equity or debt financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  any proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt may be required to be used  in whole or in part  to make mandatory payments under our credit agreements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of april  payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations thereafter total in millions long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations defined benefit pension plan contributions other total represents the principal balance and interest payments for the first and second lien term loans 
interest on the first and second lien term loans is based on libor plus  and libor plus  with libor subject to a floor 
for the purposes of estimating libor  the greater of the average month libor from the last three years and the libor floor has been used 
no amounts are included in fiscal and thereafter for potential repayments relating to excess cash flows as an estimate is not practical 
represents the principal and interest payments for capital lease obligations 
interest rates on these loans range from to  as described in our consolidated financial statements 
operating lease obligations exclude payments to be received by us under sublease arrangements 
represents the estimated contribution to our defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom over the next months 
the amount of annual employer contributions required to fund the deficit is determined every three years in accordance with uk regulations  and is based on a calendar year 
in june  our annual funding requirement to fund the pension deficit for the fiscal year was determined to be million million  with increases at an annual rate of for fiscal years and future funding requirements after fiscal year are highly dependent on the unfunded pension liability and the time period in which the deficit is amortized 
as a result  liabilities arising from the remaining unfunded deficit in our defined benefit pension plan are not included in the above table 
as of april   the unfunded liability was million 
represents payments under an information technology outsourcing agreement 
total contractual obligations listed do not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  except for those associated with a long term liability 
contractual obligations also exclude million of liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty of the timing of any potential settlement 
obligations arising from r d spending commitments under an agreement  dated october   among us  march networks corporation and the government of canada are not included in the above table 
the agreement  as last amended on march   requires us to spend at least of our annual revenues in r d in canada each year  and to make at least of our total r d expenditures in canada each year  until an aggregate of c million worth of r d has been spent in canada since april  at april   we have spent approximately million on r d activities in canada since april  purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as  in many instances  purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have the following significant off balance sheet arrangements letters of credit we had million in letters of credit outstanding as of april  april  million 
bid and performance related bonds we enter into bid and performance related bonds related to various customer contracts 
potential payments due under these may be related to our performance and or our channel partners performance under the applicable contract 
the total maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under bid and performance related bonds  excluding letters of credit  was million as of april  april  million 
historically  we have not made any payments and we do not anticipate that we will be required to make any material payments under these types of bonds 
intellectual property indemnification obligations we enter into agreements on a regular basis with customers and suppliers that include limited intellectual property indemnification obligations that are customary in the industry 
these obligations generally require us to compensate the other party for certain damages and costs incurred as a result of third party intellectual property claims arising from these transactions 
the nature of these intellectual property indemnification obligations prevents us from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount we could be required to pay to our customers and suppliers 
historically  we have not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements and no amount has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements with respect to these obligations 
off balance sheet lease obligations we offer our customers lease financing and other services under our managed services offering 
we fund this offering  which we have branded as the totalsolution program  in part through the sale to financial institutions of rental payment streams under the leases 
such financial institutions have the option to require us to repurchase such income streams  subject to limitations  in the event of defaults by lease customers and  accordingly  we maintain reserves based on loss experience and past due accounts 
in addition  such financial institutions have the option to require us to repurchase such income streams upon any uncured breach by us under the terms of the underlying sale agreements 
at april   sold payments remaining unbilled net of lease recourse reserves  which represents the total balance of leases that is not included in our balance sheet  were million april  million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the determination of estimates requires the use of assumptions and the exercise of judgment and as such actual results could differ from those estimated 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the following critical accounting policies are those that we believe require a high level of subjectivity and judgment and have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance revenue recognition  sales type leases and the lease recourse liability  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill valuation  special charges and restructuring costs  income taxes  pension costs  and stock based compensation 

table of contents revenue recognition for products sold through our authorized channel partners  arrangements usually involve multiple elements  including post contract technical support 
we also sell products and installation and related maintenance and support services directly to customers 
due to the nature of our sales agreements  judgment is routinely applied in the area of unbundling of multiple element arrangements using the relative selling price hierarchy 
in particular  to determine the relative selling price of each element in a multiple element arrangement  we first determine whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price exists for each element 
where vsoe of selling price does not exist for an element  we then look to third party evidence of selling price 
however  third party evidence is not generally available as our product offerings differ from those of our competitors and competitor pricing is often not available 
in such cases where vsoe and third party evidence cannot establish a selling price  we estimate the selling price for an element by determining the price at which we would transact if the products or services were to be sold on a standalone basis 
in establishing the estimated selling price  management judgment is involved and we consider a number of factors including  but not limited to  geographies  customer segments and pricing practices 
sales type leases in a sales type lease transaction  hardware revenues are recognized at the present value of the payments allocated to the equipment lease element at the time of system sale 
the costs of systems installed under these sales type leases are recorded as costs of sales 
the net rental streams are sold to financial institutions on a regular basis with the income streams discounted by prevailing like term rates at the time of sale 
gains or losses resulting from the resale of net rental payments from such leases are recorded as net sales 
we establish and maintain reserves against potential recourse following the sale of sales type leases based upon historical loss experience  past due accounts and specific account analysis 
the allowance for uncollectible minimum lease payments and recourse liability at the end of the year represents reserves against the entire lease portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on a regular basis and adjusts the allowance as required 
these reserves are either netted in the accounts receivable  netted in the current and long term components of net investments in sales type leases on the balance sheet  or  for off balance sheet leases  recorded as a lease recourse liability and included in long term liabilities on our balance sheet 
our total reserve for losses related to the entire lease portfolio  including amounts classified as accounts receivable on our balance sheet  was of the ending aggregate lease portfolio as of april  compared to at april  the reserve is based on a review of past write off experience and a review of the accounts receivable aging as of april  we believe our reserves are adequate to cover future potential write offs 
should  however  the financial condition of our customers deteriorate in the future  additional reserves in amounts that could be material to the financial statements could be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of customer accounts 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in order to make this assessment  including a detailed analysis of the aging of our accounts receivable and the current credit worthiness of our customers and an analysis of historical bad debts and other adjustments 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimate of the recoverability of amounts due could be adversely affected 
we review in detail our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis and adjust the allowance amount estimate to reflect actual portfolio performance and change in future portfolio performance expectations 
as of april  and april   the provision represented and of gross receivables  respectively 
goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
an impairment charge is recorded if the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the book value 
table of contents of goodwill for that unit 
at april  and april   our reporting units were our operating segments 
at april  our total goodwill of million was allocated as follows million to our mcs segment  million to our netsolutions segment and nil to our other segment 
quoted stock market prices are not available for these individual reporting units 
accordingly  our methodology for estimating the fair value of each reporting unit primarily considers estimated future revenues and cash flows for those reporting units along with many other assumptions 
our valuation approach includes a detailed valuation analysis of both the company as a whole and the reporting units 
in performing the annual goodwill impairment test we considered three generally accepted approaches for valuing a business the income  market and cost approaches 
based on the nature of our business and the reporting units current and expected financial performance  we determined that the market approach was the most appropriate method for estimating the fair value of the reporting units under the first step of the analysis 
for the market approach  we analyzed the valuation indicators that our market capitalization implies  including enterprise value to ebitda 
consideration of these factors inherently involves a significant amount of judgment  and significant changes in the underlying assumptions used may result in fluctuations in the value of goodwill that is supported 
the result of the most recent annual impairment test  performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulted in no impairment charge 
the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
the fiscal and fiscal annual impairment tests also resulted in no impairment charge 
during fiscal  the loss on the sale of our datanet business included a charge of million for goodwill related to the datanet business  as described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
erosion in capital markets  material reductions in our expected cash flow forecasts  significant reductions in our market capitalization or a significant decline in economic conditions  in addition to changes to the underlying assumptions used in our valuation approach described above  could all lead to future impairment in goodwill 
special charges and restructuring costs we record restructuring  exit and other loss accruals when the liability has been incurred 
these charges relate primarily to workforce reductions and lease termination obligations 
estimates used to establish lease termination obligations have been reduced for sublease income that we believe is probable 
because we are required to project sublease income for many years into the future  management used considerable judgment in determining certain estimates relating to the timing  availability and amount of sublease income that we expect to receive 
as of april   the liability relating to lease termination obligations was million  with million recorded as current april  total of million  with million recorded as current 
this estimate will change as a result of actual results  the passage of time and changes in assumptions regarding vacancy  market rate  and operating costs 
income taxes we have significant net deferred tax assets resulting from operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences that may reduce taxable income in future periods 
valuation allowances have been established for deferred tax assets based on a more likely than not threshold 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is recorded 
future changes in estimates of taxable income could result in a significant change to the valuation allowance 

table of contents in fiscal  we updated our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
at april   as a result of uncertainty regarding the future utilization of certain deferred tax assets  there continues to be a valuation allowance of million april  million against deferred tax assets primarily in the united kingdom 
in fiscal  we updated our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
based primarily on stronger operating performance in fiscal  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize a benefit from an additional portion of our deferred tax assets in canada 
as a result  we relieved a valuation allowance of approximately million  primarily relating to the deferred tax assets in canada 
numerous taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax positions taken by businesses 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these jurisdictions 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense would result 
pension costs we currently maintain a defined benefit pension plan for a number of our past and present employees in the united kingdom 
the plan was closed to new employees in june in november  present employees ceased earning credit for new service 
the november change was recorded as a plan curtailment 
our defined benefit pension costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  inflation rates  expected return on plan assets and life expectancy of the members 
in estimating the rates and returns  we consider current market conditions and anticipate how these will affect discount rates and expected returns 
material changes in our pension benefit costs may occur in the future as a result of changes to these assumptions or market conditions 
in fiscal  our pension liability increased by million to million from million at april  due to a million increase in the benefit obligation  partially offset by million increase in plan assets 
the increase in benefit obligation was primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate from to as a result of macro economic conditions  partially offset by a million decrease in the obligation due to the plan curtailment 
the increase in plan assets was primarily due to the actual return on our plan assets being significantly above our expected return 
in fiscal  our pension liability increased by million to million from million at april  this increase was primarily due to the actual return on our plan assets being below our expected return  in addition to an increase in the benefit obligation as a result of a decrease in the discount rate to from due to macro economic conditions 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense in accordance with the stock compensation topic of the fasb asc 
the fair value of the stock options granted is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model for each award  net of estimated forfeitures  and is recognized over the employees requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we have estimated the volatility of our common shares using the historical volatility of comparable public companies 
we determine the comparable public companies based on a number of factors including similarity to us with respect to industry  business model  stage of growth and financial risk 
the selection of comparable public companies requires significant management judgment and a change in the volatility assumption could significantly affect the determination of stock based compensation expense 
we expect to continue to use the historical volatility of comparable companies until our historical volatility as a publicly traded company is sufficiently established to measure expected volatility for option grants 

table of contents based on these assumptions  stock based compensation expense reduced our results of operations by million for the year ended april  year ended april  million  million 
as of april   there was million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to stock option awards april  million 
we expect these awards to be recognized over a weighted average period of years april  years 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements adopted in fiscal other comprehensive income in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of comprehensive income 
the asu provides amendments to the comprehensive income subtopic of the fasb accounting standards codification asc  such that comprehensive income must be presented in a single continuous statement with net income  or in a separate  but consecutive  statement 
we adopted this asu in the first quarter of fiscal by reporting a separate statement of comprehensive income loss 
in february  the fasb issued asu to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the asu provides amendments to the comprehensive income subtopic of the fasb asc  such that companies must report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income 
for other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity may cross reference to the relevant note disclosure 
we adopted this asu in the fourth quarter of fiscal by cross referencing the significant reclassifications to the relevant note disclosure 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in our future earnings due to adverse changes in financial markets 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
inflation has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency rate fluctuations related primarily to our future net cash flows from operations in canadian dollars  british pounds sterling  australian dollars and euros 
when possible  we use foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of currency fluctuations on foreign currency receivables  payables and intercompany balances 
these contracts are not entered into for speculative purposes  and are not treated as hedges for accounting purposes 
foreign currency contracts are recorded at fair market value 
the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of april   a appreciation in the us dollar against all currencies would have resulted in an additional unrealized gain of million on those foreign currency forward contracts 
as at april   a depreciation in the us dollar against all currencies would have resulted in an additional unrealized loss of million on those foreign currency forward contracts 
interest rate risk in accordance with our corporate policy  cash equivalent and short term investment balances are primarily comprised of high grade commercial paper and money market instruments with original maturity dates of less than three months 
due to the short term maturity of these investments  we are not subject to significant interest rate risk 

table of contents we are exposed to interest rate risk on our million undrawn revolving credit facility  which currently bears interest at a rate of libor plus and expires in february if the entire revolving credit facility were utilized  each adverse change in libor would currently result in an additional million in interest expense per year 
during fiscal  no amounts were drawn under revolving facilities 
we are exposed to interest rate risk on our new credit facilities 
our million first lien term loan matures in february and bears interest at a rate of libor plus and our million second lien term loan matures in february and bears interest at a rate of libor plus 
libor is subject to a floor of for both term loans 
the impact of each adverse change in libor on the first lien term loan and the second lien term loan  in aggregate  would result in an additional million in interest expense per year 
however  we would not be affected by adverse changes in interest rates until libor exceeds the floor 
in addition  our defined benefit pension plan is exposed to changes in interest rate risk through its investment in bonds and the discount rate assumption 
the interest rates on our obligations under capital leases are fixed and therefore not subject to interest rate risk 
credit risk our financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  other receivables  sales type lease receivables as well as assets held by our defined benefit pension plan 
in addition  we are exposed to credit risk through our recourse obligations on sold sales type leases 
cash equivalents are invested in government and commercial paper with investment grade credit rating 
we are exposed to normal credit risk from customers 
however  we have a large number of diverse customers to minimize concentrations of credit risk
