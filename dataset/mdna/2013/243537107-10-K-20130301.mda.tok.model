independent third parties manufacture all of our products 
in  we converted our teva business in belgium  the netherlands  luxemburg benelux and france from a distributor model to a wholesale model 
in january  we converted from a distributor model to a wholesale model for the ugg  teva  and simple brands in the uk and ireland and the ugg and simple brands in benelux and france 
our business has been impacted by  what we believe are  several important trends and we expect that it will continue to be impacted volatile us and global economic conditions and general changes in the market have adversely impacted businesses worldwide 
some of our customers have been  and more may be  adversely affected  which in turn has  and may continue to  adversely impact our financial results 
the sheepskin used in certain ugg products is in high demand and limited supply  and there have been significant increases in the prices of sheepskin as the demand from competitors for this material has increased 
however  we expect our sheepskin costs to decrease in compared to due to lower pricing negotiated for our fall product costs 
the markets for casual  outdoor  and athletic footwear have grown significantly during the last decade 
we believe this growth is a result of the trend toward casual dress in the workplace  increasingly active outdoor lifestyles  and a growing emphasis on comfort 
consumers are more often seeking footwear designed to address a broader array of activities with the same quality  comfort  and high performance attributes they have come to expect from traditional athletic footwear 

table of contents consumers have narrowed their footwear product breadth  focusing on brands with a rich heritage and authenticity as market category creators and leaders 
consumers have become increasingly focused on luxury and comfort  seeking out products and brands that are fashionable while still comfortable 
there is an emerging sustainable lifestyle movement happening all around the world  and consumers are demanding that brands and companies become more environmentally responsible 
consumers are following a recent trend of buy now  wear now 
this trend entails the consumer waiting to purchase shoes until they will actually wear them  which includes the impact weather will have on their decision of when to buy  contrasted with a tendency in the past to purchase shoes they did not plan to wear until later 
by emphasizing our brands images and our focus on comfort  performance and authenticity  we believe we can continue to maintain a loyal consumer following that is less susceptible to fluctuations caused by changing fashions and changes in consumer preferences 
we have also responded to consumer focus on sustainability by establishing objectives  policies  and procedures to help us drive key sustainability initiatives around human rights  environmental sustainability  and community affairs 
we have experienced significant cost increases  most over the past several years  notably with respect to sheepskin 
we attempt to cover the full amount of our sheepskin purchases under fixed price contracts 
we continually strive to contain our material costs through increasing the mix of non sheepskin products  exploring new footwear materials and new production technologies  and utilizing lower cost production  including in the us from where we began sourcing products in also  refer to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion of our commodity price risk 
below is an overview of the various components of our business  including some key factors that affect each business and some of our strategies for growing each business 
ugg brand overview ugg australia has grown to be well known in the us and internationally in the footwear industry 
with loyal consumers around the world  including high profile celebrities  the ugg brand continually earns media exposure from numerous outlets both organically and from strategic public relations efforts 
the ugg brand has invested in paid media creating impactful integrated campaigns across multiple channels including television  out of home ooh  print  digital and social that are globally scalable  contributing to broader public awareness of the brand 
we believe the increased global media focus and demand for ugg products has been driven by the following consumer brand loyalty  due to the luxurious comfort of ugg footwear  continued innovation of new product categories and styles  including those beyond footwear  increased marketing for women and men in targeted high end print  ooh  digital and social advertising  a targeted ugg for men campaign featuring tom brady  targeted marketing at prospective consumers through email blasts  new catalogs and direct mail pieces  successful targeting of higher end distribution  expanded product assortment purchases from existing accounts  adoption by high profile celebrities as a favored footwear brand  
table of contents increased media attention that has enabled us to introduce the brand to consumers much faster than we would have otherwise been able to  increased exposure to the brand driven by our concept stores that showcase all of our product offerings  continued expansion of worldwide retail through new ugg australia stores  continued geographic expansion across the us and internationally  and expansion of our shop in shop program worldwide 
we believe the luxurious comfort of ugg products will continue to drive long term consumer demand 
recognizing that there is a significant fashion element to ugg footwear and that footwear fashions fluctuate  our strategy seeks to continually extend the longevity of the brand by offering a broader product line suitable for wear in a variety of climates and occasions and by limiting distribution to selected higher end retailers 
as part of this strategy  we have increased our product offering  including a growing spring line  an expanded men line  and a fall line that consists of a range of luxurious collections for both genders  an expanded kids line  as well as handbags  cold weather accessories  and apparel 
we are introducing more ugg products to drive excitement and demand during the historically slow retail period between back to school and thanksgiving 
we have also recently expanded our marketing and promotional efforts  which we believe has contributed  and will continue to contribute  to our growth 
we believe that the evolution of the ugg brand and our strategy of product diversification also will help decrease our reliance on sheepskin  which is in high demand and subject to price volatility 
nonetheless  we cannot assure investors that our efforts will continue to provide ugg brand growth

the sanuk brand operations are included in our results of operations effective upon the acquisition date of july  the increase in net sales was primarily due to the addition of the sanuk brand as well as increased ugg brand sales through our retail stores and ecommerce sites  partially offset by decreased ugg  teva and other brands product sales through our wholesale channel

we experienced an increase in the number of pairs sold primarily through our sanuk wholesale channel and continued retail and ecommerce growth  partially offset by a decrease in pairs sold in our ugg  teva  and other brands wholesale segments 
this resulted in a overall increase in the volume of footwear sold for all brands and channels to approximately million pairs for the year ended december  compared to approximately million pairs for our weighted average wholesale selling price per pair decreased to for the year ended december

we experienced an increase in the average selling price in all other segments excluding ecommerce 
wholesale net sales of our ugg brand decreased primarily due to the volume of pairs sold  partially offset by an increase in the average selling price 
the decrease in volume was primarily due to our wholesale customers in the us  as well as our wholesale customers in benelux and the uk and distributors in europe and asia  partially offset by an increase in volume to our wholesale customers in japan and distributors in canada and latin america 
for ugg wholesale net sales  the decrease in volume had an estimated impact of approximately  and the increase in weighted average wholesale selling price per pair had an estimated impact of approximately  we believe the decline was partially due to reduced orders for the fall season caused by our customers increased carryover inventory levels resulting from the warm winter in the prior year  a new trend of on demand purchasing whereby consumers shift the timing of their purchases to when they plan to actually wear the shoes  as well as the recessionary conditions in europe 
at this time  we expect our customers carryover inventory levels to decrease but not diminish completely 
we expect the trend of on demand purchasing to continue for the foreseeable future  thus shifting sales into future periods  and we continue to address pricing and use global strategy to pursue sales in other parts of the world to mitigate the risk in europe

net sales of our ecommerce business increased due to an increase in the volume of pairs sold primarily attributable to the ugg brand  partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price 
the decrease in the average selling price was primarily due to the addition of sanuk brand sales which carry lower average selling prices 
net sales of our retail store business  which are primarily ugg brand sales  increased largely due to the addition of new stores opened since december  we do not expect this growth rate to continue because as we increase the number of our stores  each new store will have less proportional impact on our growth rate 
we cannot assure investors that retail store sales will continue to grow at their recent pace or that revenue from our retail store business will not at some point decline

international sales  which are included in the segment sales above  for all of our products combined increased by and represented and of worldwide net sales for the year ended december  and  respectively

as a percentage of net sales  gross margin decreased primarily due to increased sheepskin and other material costs as well as an increased impact of discounted and closeout sales in the uk and benelux for our ugg and teva brands 
our sheepskin costs in were approximately higher than our costs 
these decreases to gross margin were partially offset by the contribution of the sanuk brand  which generally carries higher margins  and increased gross profits for our ecommerce and retail stores segments

once our current inventory is sold through and we begin to sell the product that was purchased with the lower priced sheepskin  we expect the gross margin and income from operations to be positively impacted

under adverse economic conditions  we may be unable to realize a return on our cash and cash equivalents  generate sufficient cash from operations  access our credit agreement  or secure additional credit on favorable terms 
such failures may impact our working capital reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business 
our cash flow cycle includes the purchase of inventories  the subsequent sale of the inventories  and the eventual collection of the resulting accounts receivables 
as a result  our working capital requirements begin when we purchase  or make deposits on  the inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting receivables 
the seasonality of our ugg brand business requires us to build fall and winter 
table of contents inventories in the second and third quarters to support sales for the ugg brand major selling seasons  which historically occur during the third and fourth quarters  whereas  the teva and sanuk brands generally begin to build inventory levels beginning in the fourth and first quarters in anticipation of the spring selling season that occurs in the first and second quarters 
given the seasonality of our ugg  teva  and sanuk brands  our working capital requirements fluctuate significantly throughout the year 
the cash required to fund these working capital fluctuations has been provided using our cash flows from operations and short term borrowings 
as needed  we borrow funds under our credit agreement 
the following table summarizes our cash flows and working capital year ended december  change amount net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities cash and cash equivalents trade accounts receivable inventories prepaids and other current assets total current assets trade accounts payable other current liabilities total current liabilities net working capital cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to the differences in yearly changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets  inventories and trade accounts receivable 
prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased in fiscal year  adding to net cash provided by operating activities  while they increased in fiscal year inventories increased by less in fiscal year than they did in fiscal year  resulting in less cash used in operating activities 
trade accounts receivable decreased slightly in fiscal year  while they increased in fiscal year the change in prepaid expenses and other current assets was due to refunds of deposits received in accordance with our contracts to purchase sheepskin in fiscal year compared to deposits paid in fiscal year the smaller increase in inventory was primarily due to the international expansion that occurred in fiscal year and did not repeat in fiscal year the change in accounts receivable was primarily due to decreased wholesale sales as well as increased cash collections in fiscal year versus fiscal year these increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by a smaller increase in accounts payable  which increased less in fiscal year versus fiscal year accounts payable increased less primarily due to our decreased inventory purchases 
net working capital decreased as of december  from december   primarily as a result of decreased cash and prepaid and other current assets  and an increase in our short term borrowings and accounts payable 
these decreases to working capital were partially offset by higher inventory 
changes in working capital are due to the items discussed above  as well as our normal seasonality and timing of cash receipts and cash payments 
wholesale accounts receivable turnover decreased to times in the twelve months ended december  from times for the twelve months ended december   primarily due to higher average accounts receivable balances  partially offset by increased cash collections for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  the higher accounts receivable balances were partially the result of the conversion of our european distributor 
table of contents business to our european wholesale operations  which provides us higher selling prices and also extends the payment terms of our customers compared to sales we make to distributors 
our selling prices through our wholesale channel directly to retailers are substantially higher than our selling prices to our distributors  because when we sell product to distributors  the pricing needs to allow for the distributors to then sell the product to retailers at a profit 
further  our sales terms are longer for wholesale sales made directly to retailers than for sales made to distributors  because distributors either pre pay for orders or have day letters of credit 
these longer payment terms for our wholesale customers have lead to higher accounts receivable balances 
we do not expect that the conversion to our european wholesale operations will be a cause of further decline in our accounts receivable turnover in the near term as we do not expect additional conversions in the near term 
inventory turnover decreased to times for the twelve months ended december  compared to times for the twelve months ended december   primarily due to higher average inventory levels during the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december   partially offset by increased sales 
the higher inventory balances were primarily attributed to our projected increased sales  increased international inventory  new retail locations  and increased materials and factory costs 
we are maintaining higher international inventory levels in part because of our recent conversions to a wholesale business from a distributor business 
we warehouse inventory in anticipation of shipping to our wholesale customers  whereas sales to our distributors are drop shipped and are not supplied from inventory on hand 
this has caused the inventory turnover to decrease but we expect this trend to level off since we are not expecting any additional conversions in the near term 
cash from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  resulted from the purchases of property and equipment  as well as our acquisitions of the hoka brand and an intangible asset for lease rights for a retail store location in france 
capital expenditures in fiscal year included the build out of new retail stores and our corporate facilities 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from our acquisition of the sanuk brand and purchases of property and equipment 
capital expenditures in fiscal year included the purchase of land for our new corporate headquarters and the build out of new retail stores 
in november  we made a cash payment of approximately  for approximately fourteen acres of land for our new headquarters facility in goleta  california 
as of december   we had approximately  of material commitments for future capital expenditures primarily related to the build out of new retail stores 
we estimate that the capital expenditures for including the aforementioned commitments will range from approximately  to  we anticipate these expenditures will primarily include the construction costs of our new headquarters and new retail stores 
the actual amount of capital expenditures for the year may differ from this estimate  largely depending on the timing of new store openings or any unforeseen needs to replace existing assets and the timing of other expenditures  including design and construction of the new headquarters 
cash from financing activities 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was comprised primarily of repayments of short term borrowings and repurchases of our common stock  as well as contingent consideration paid related to our sanuk acquisition  and the purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interest in our joint venture with stella international 
our decision to borrow  was largely due to our repurchase of  of our common stock 
the cash used was partially offset by cash from our short term borrowings  leaving a  balance for borrowings as of december  for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was comprised primarily of repayments of short term borrowings  cash paid for shares withheld for taxes from employee stock unit vesting and for repurchases of our common stock 
the cash used was partially offset by cash from our 
table of contents short term borrowings  leaving a zero balance for borrowings as of december   and excess tax benefits from stock compensation 
the excess tax benefits from stock compensation changes were larger than the prior period primarily due to the issuance of stock in relation to our long term incentive program 
in february  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to  of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements  and other factors 
the program did not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program could have been suspended at any time at our discretion 
as of june   the company repurchased approximately  shares under this program  for approximately  or an average price of 
as of june   the company had repurchased the full amount authorized under this program 
the purchases were funded from available working capital 
in june  the company approved a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to  of the company common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements  and other factors 
the program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at the company discretion 
as of december   the company had repurchased approximately  shares under this program  for approximately  or an average price of  leaving the remaining approved amount at  in august  we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  national association as the administrative agent  comerica bank and hsbc bank usa  national association  as syndication agents  and the lenders party thereto 
in august we amended and restated in its entirety the credit agreement amended and restated credit agreement 
the amended and restated credit agreement is a five year   secured revolving credit facility 
refer to note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on our amended and restated credit agreement 
at december   we had approximately  of outstanding borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement and outstanding letters of credit of  leaving  available under the amended and restated credit agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and we remain in compliance as of the date of this report 
subsequent to december   we repaid  resulting in no outstanding borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement as of march  contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total our operating lease obligations consist primarily of building leases for our retail locations  distribution centers  and corporate and regional offices 
the majority of other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets  with the exception of our sanuk contingent consideration liability discussed below  are related to deferred rents  of which the cash lease payments are included in operating lease obligations in this table 
our purchase obligations consist mostly of open purchase orders 
they also include promotional expenses and service contracts 
outstanding purchase orders are primarily with our third party manufacturers and are expected to be paid within one year 
these are outstanding open orders and 
table of contents not minimum purchase obligations 
our promotional expenditures and service contracts are due periodically through we have also entered into minimum purchase commitments with certain suppliers see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
certain of the agreements require that we advance specified minimum payment amounts 
we have included the total remaining cash commitments under these agreements  net of deposits  as of december  in this table 
we expect sheepskin purchases by third party factories supplying ugg product to us will eventually exceed the minimum commitment levels  therefore we believe the deposits will become fully refundable  and thus  we believe this will not materially affect our results of operations  as it is in the normal course of our business 
commitments and contingencies 
the following reflect the additional commitments and contingent liabilities that may have a material impact on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
the purchase price for the sanuk brand also includes contingent consideration over the next five years as follows of the sanuk brand gross profit in  which was of the sanuk brand gross profit in  and of the sanuk brand gross profit in there is no maximum to the contingent consideration payments for   and estimated contingent consideration payments of  are included within other accrued expenses and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   and are not included in the table above 
see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the purchase price for the hoka brand also includes contingent consideration through  with a maximum of  estimated contingent consideration payments of  are included within other accrued expenses and long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   and are not included in the table above 
see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we are currently involved in various legal claims arising from the ordinary course of business 
management does not believe that the disposition of any of these matters  whether individually or collectively  will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in addition  we have agreed to indemnify certain licensees  distributors and promotional partners in connection with claims related to the use of our intellectual property 
the terms of such agreements range up to five years initially and generally do not provide for a limitation on the maximum potential future payments 
management believes the likelihood of any payments is remote and would be immaterial 
we determined the risk was low based on a prior history of insignificant claims 
we are not currently involved in any indemnification matters in regards to our intellectual property 
on may   a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the central district of california against the company and certain of its officers 
on august   a similar purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the district of delaware against the company and certain of its officers 
these actions are purportedly brought on behalf of purchasers of the company publicly traded securities between october  and april  plaintiffs in both complaints allege that defendants made false and misleading statements  purport to assert claims for violations of the federal securities laws  and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief 
the california case has been dismissed with prejudice  the delaware action remains pending 
we believe the claim in the delaware complaint is without merit and intend to defend the action vigorously 
while we believe there is no legal basis for liability  due to the uncertainty surrounding the litigation process  we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss  if any  at this time 

table of contents on july  and july   purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the california superior court for the county of santa barbara against our board of directors and several of our officers 
the company is named as nominal defendant 
plaintiffs in the state derivative actions allege that the board allowed certain officers to make allegedly false and misleading statements 
the complaints include claims for violation of the federal securities laws  breach of fiduciary duties  mismanagement  waste of corporate assets  insider trading  unjust enrichment  and violations of the california corporations code 
the complaints seek compensatory damages  disgorgement  and other relief 
we believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend the actions vigorously 
while we believe there is no legal basis for liability  due to the uncertainty surrounding the litigation process  we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss  if any  at this time 
we believe that cash generated from operations  the available borrowings under our existing amended and restated credit agreement  and our cash and cash equivalents will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  risks and uncertainties that could impact our ability to maintain or grow our cash position include our earnings growth rate  the continued strength of our brands  our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences  our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner  our ability to effectively manage our inventories  our ability to generate returns on our acquisitions of businesses  and market volatility  among others 
see part i  item a  risk factors for a discussion of additional factors that may affect our cash position 
furthermore  we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  we may seek to sell debt securities or additional equity securities or to obtain a new credit agreement or draw on our existing amended and restated credit agreement 
the sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in incurring debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
although there are no other material present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to the acquisition of any other businesses  we may evaluate acquisitions of other businesses or brands 
impact of inflation we believe that the rates of inflation in the three most recent fiscal years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates refer to note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
those policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report are revenue recognition  use of estimates  which includes the below reserves and allowances  inventories  accounting for long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  fair value of contingent consideration  and stock compensation 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts during the reporting period 
management reasonably could use different estimates and assumptions  and changes in estimates and assumptions could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a potential material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we have historically been materially accurate in our estimates used for the reserves and allowances below 

table of contents the following table summarizes data related to the critical accounting estimates for accounts receivable allowances and reserves  which are discussed below december  december  amount of gross trade accounts receivable amount of gross trade accounts receivable gross trade accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts reserve for sales discounts allowance for estimated chargebacks amount of net sales amount of net sales net sales for the three months ended allowance for estimated returns estimated returns liability allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against trade accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged trade accounts receivables  economic conditions and forecasts  historical experience and the customers credit worthiness 
trade accounts receivable that are subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
the reserve includes specific reserves for accounts  which all or a portion of are identified as potentially uncollectible  plus a non specific reserve for the balance of accounts based on our historical loss experience 
reserves have been established for all projected losses of this nature 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the reserve for the accounts we consider to have credit risk and are not specifically identified as uncollectible would change the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  by approximately reserve for sales discounts 
a significant portion of our domestic net sales  as well as our international wholesale sales  and resulting trade accounts receivable reflects a discount that our customers may take  generally based upon meeting certain order  shipment and payment timelines 
we use the amount of the discounts that are available to be taken against the period end trade accounts receivable to estimate and record a corresponding reserve for sales discounts 
the decrease in the reserve was primarily due to one of our largest customers receiving discounted pricing on invoices rather than receiving payment terms discounts  which lowered the overall reserve 
allowance for estimated chargebacks 
when our wholesale customers pay their invoices  they often take deductions for chargebacks against their invoices  which are often valid 
therefore  we record an allowance for the balance of chargebacks that are outstanding in our accounts receivable balance as of the end of each period  along with an estimated reserve for chargebacks that have not yet been taken against outstanding accounts receivable balances 
this estimate is based on historical trends of the timing and amount of chargebacks taken against invoices 
allowance for estimated returns and estimated returns liability 
we record an allowance for anticipated future returns of goods shipped prior to period end and a liability for anticipated returns of goods sold direct to consumers 
in general  we accept returns for damaged or defective products 
we also have a policy whereby we accept returns from our retail and ecommerce customers for a thirty day period 
we base the amounts of the allowance and liability on any approved customer requests for returns  historical returns experience  and any recent events that could result in a change from historical returns rates  among other factors 
the allowance for estimated returns increased as a percentage of net sales due to higher levels of actual returns received subsequent to year end 
our use of different estimates and 
table of contents assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the percentage of sales expected to ultimately be returned would change the allowance and liability reserves for returns in total at december  by approximately  our historical estimates for returns have been reasonably accurate 
inventory write downs 
we review the various items in inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete  and impaired inventory 
in doing so  we write the inventory down to the lower of cost or expected future net selling prices 
at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  the amount of inventory write downs as a percentage of inventory were and as of december  and  respectively 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the estimated selling prices of our potentially obsolete inventory would change the inventory write down reserve at december  by approximately  valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill  intangible  and other long lived assets on a separate asset basis based on assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying amount of these assets individually 
we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets 
we evaluated our ugg  sanuk and other brands goodwill and our teva trademarks 
based on the carrying amounts of the ugg  teva  sanuk and other brands goodwill  trademarks  and net assets  the brands sales and operating results  and the brands long term forecasts of sales and operating results as of their evaluation dates  we concluded that the carrying amounts of the ugg  sanuk and other brands goodwill  as well as the teva trademarks  were not impaired 
our teva trademarks were evaluated under asu  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  and we concluded  based on an evaluation of all relevant qualitative factors  including macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  financial performance  entity specific events  and legal  regulatory  contractual  political  business  or other factors  that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the teva trademarks is less than its carrying amount  and accordingly we did not perform a quantitative impairment test for the teva trademarks 
our goodwill balance at december  represents goodwill in the ugg  sanuk and other brands reporting units 
we believe that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the ugg reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying value 
we believe that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the sanuk reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying value  as we have increased our sanuk sales and profitability forecasts since the acquisition 
we believe that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the other brands reporting unit fair value is less than its carrying value  as we only recently completed our acquisition of the related goodwill as of september   and have not experienced any significant negative trends since acquisition 
all goodwill was evaluated based on qualitative analyses 
we also evaluated amortizable long lived assets  including intangible assets as of december  and we recorded immaterial impairment losses in sg a in our other brands segment and for one of our retail stores for which the fair values did not exceed their carrying values 
we recorded certain amortizable intangible assets related to our sanuk and hoka acquisitions see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the valuation methodologies used 
our other valuation methodologies used as of december  did not change from the prior year 

table of contents fair value of contingent consideration 
we have entered into contingent consideration arrangements when we acquired brands 
the fair value of our sanuk brand contingent consideration is material and highly subjective 
it is based on estimated future sales and gross profits  and discount rates  among other variables and estimates  and certain years have no maximum payment see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these are evaluated each reporting period and the contingent consideration is adjusted accordingly 
our estimated revenue forecasts include a compound annual growth rate of through our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the estimated compound annual growth rate would change the total liability balance at december  by approximately  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
we purchase certain materials that are affected by commodity prices  the most significant of which is sheepskin 
the supply of sheepskin used in certain ugg products is in high demand and there are a limited number of suppliers able to meet our expectations for the quantity and quality of sheepskin required 
there have been significant increases in the price of sheepskin in recent years as the demand from us and our competitors for this commodity has increased 
we experienced an approximate increase in sheepskin costs in compared to we expect an overall decrease in for this commodity due to lower pricing negotiated for our fall product costs  the majority of which will be realized in the fourth quarter of other significant factors affecting the price of sheepskin include weather patterns  harvesting decisions  global economic conditions  and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
we use purchasing contracts  pricing arrangements  and refundable deposits to attempt to reduce the impact of price volatility as an alternative to hedging commodity prices 
the purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements we use may result in unconditional purchase obligations  which are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
in the event of significant commodity cost increases  we will likely not be able to adjust our selling prices sufficiently to mitigate the impact on our margins 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we face market risk to the extent that changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our foreign assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we hedge certain foreign currency forecasted transactions and exposures from existing assets and liabilities 
other than an increasing amount of sales  expenses  and financial positions denominated in foreign currencies  we do not believe that there has been a material change in the nature of our primary market risk exposures  including the categories of market risk to which we are exposed and the particular markets that present the primary risk of loss 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we do not know of or expect there to be any material change in the general nature of our primary market risk exposure in the near term 
we currently utilize forward contracts and other derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate  for a portion of the amounts we expect to purchase and sell in foreign currencies 
as our international operations grow and we increase purchases and sales in foreign currencies  we will evaluate and may utilize additional derivative instruments  as needed  to hedge our foreign currency exposures 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for trading purposes 
although the majority of our sales and inventory purchases are denominated in us currency  these sales and inventory purchases may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies in the international markets where our products are sold and manufactured 
our foreign currency exposure is generated primarily from our asian and european operations 
approximately  or  of our total net sales for the year ended december  were denominated in foreign currencies 
certain of our foreign subsidiaries local currency is their designated functional currency 
as we begin to hold more cash and other monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than our subsidiary functional currency  we are exposed to financial statement transaction gains and losses as a result of remeasuring the operating results and financial positions into their functional currency 
we remeasure these monetary assets and liabilities using the exchange rate as of the end of the 
table of contents reporting period 
in addition  we translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with reporting currencies other than us dollars into us dollars using the exchange rates at of the end of the reporting period  which results in financial statement translation gains and losses in other comprehensive income 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our reported profits and can distort comparisons from year to year 
in addition  if the us dollar strengthens  it may result in increased pricing pressure on our foreign distributors  and retailers  which may have a negative impact on our net sales and gross margins 
as of december   our non designated derivative contracts had notional amounts totaling approximately  these contracts were comprised of offsetting contracts with the same counterparty  each expire in march  and have an unrealized gain of approximately at december  subsequent to december  we entered into designated hedging contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately  interest rate risk 
our market risk exposure with respect to financial instruments is tied to changes in the prime rate in the us and changes in the london interbank offered rate libor 
our amended and restated credit agreement provides for interest on outstanding borrowings at rates tied to the prime rate or  at our election  tied to libor 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement of  a increase in interest rates on our current borrowings would not have a material impact on income before income taxes
