we also will continue to focus on a good  better  best approach to price points to create products that appeal to different categories of end consumers 
to the extent it is consistent with our strategy  we may acquire new products or expand existing product categories 
we believe our product development expertise differentiates us from other companies in this market 
cultivating relationships we believe we have strong relationships with our customers and suppliers 
we have long standing  solid partnerships with each of our retail partners 
we also have developed strong relationships with a group of suppliers that provide us with flexibility needed to engineer our products in a cost efficient manner and to respond quickly to customer demands  we will continue to focus on building on these existing relationships to increase our presence in these stores and to expand with our customers as they enter new geographic locations 
we will also continue to work with a growing number of specialty retail operators that would permit us continue our pursuit of a good  better  best approach and access to customers seeking differentiated products and support 
building brands historically  we have marketed products under our own brands  under license agreements for other brands  or under private label agreements 
going forward  our focus will be on building our core brands of summer and born free  particularly among first time prenatal moms  through improved marketing  including through social media 
executing operational excellence our entire organization is focused on delivering operational excellence  and we have already begun initiatives  such as sku rationalization and implementation of a direct import program  that we expect to favorably impact our operations while also providing improved results 
by improving our analytic and forecasting capabilities  product development process  and managing working capital and costs  we expect to improve internal processes that should  in turn  benefit our customers 
we believe that  based on our core strengths and strategic priorities  we are well positioned to capitalize on positive market trends  including that us birth rates are predicted to increase in after several years of low birth rates 
products we currently market more than  products in seven product categories including monitoring  health and safety  nursery  baby gear  feeding products  play  and furniture 
no single product sold generated more than of sales for the year ended december  the majority of our products are sold under the summer and born free brands

we also have development efforts in china and the united kingdom 
in addition to new product development  we continuously look for ways to improve upon existing products based on feedback from our customers and focus on the end user experience  safety  and opportunities to improve our cost structure and pricing 
we engage in market research and test marketing to evaluate consumer reactions to our products 
we also research customer buying trends and analyze information from retail stores  our sales force  focus groups  industry experts  vendors  and our product development personnel

in  we plan to re launch our prodigy travel system with new fashion and an improved stroller platform and our next generation fully internet capable monitor system  peek  which will have applications beyond the juvenile market 
suppliers and manufacturing substantially all of our other products are manufactured in asia primarily china and israel 
we also use several manufacturers in the united states for certain injection molded products  including bath tubs  potty seats and booster seats  which typically account for approximately of our annual sales 
we are not dependent on any one supplier since we use many different manufacturers and we own the tooling and molds used for our products 
our hong kong subsidiary provides us with a local sourcing presence and the ability to oversee quality  electronic engineering and other issues that may arise during production 
generally  we buy finished goods from manufacturers and thus are not directly procuring raw materials for product manufacturing 
historically  we have not experienced any significant disruption of supply to date as a result of raw material shortages or other manufacturing factors  but there is the possibility that shortages could occur in the future based on a variety of factors beyond our control 
transportation of asia made goods to our warehouses typically takes three to four weeks  depending on the location of the warehouse 
we maintain our inventory at warehouses located in the 
table of contents united states  canada  asia  and the united kingdom 
most of our customers pick up their goods at regional warehouses 
we also use ups and other common carriers to arrange shipments to customers primarily smaller retailers and specialty stores that request such arrangements 
in  our east coast distribution center was consolidated into our west coast distribution center to reduce costs 
in  we implemented a direct import program which we are expanding in  in order to reduce costs and shipping time to customers 
sales and marketing our products are largely marketed and sold through our own direct global sales force  which includes industry experienced professionals 
we have also established a strong network of independent manufacturers representatives and distributors  who provide sales and customer service support for the remaining portion of north american and international sales 
on line sales have continued to grow during recent years consistent with increased online shopping by consumers 
sales are recognized upon transfer of title of product to our customers and are made utilizing standard credit terms of to days 
we generally accept returns only for defective merchandise 
marketing  promotion and consumer education are important parts of the juvenile products industry 
historically  a significant percentage of our promotional spending has been structured in coordination with our large retail partners 
for  our plans include increasing opportunities to create awareness and outreach to both our retail partners and our end use consumer 
in further support of this communication effort  we have recently added additional functionality and capabilities to our website 
in addition  we will continue to support the promotion and presence of summer brands and products in the marketplace with our new showroom and planogram space at our principal facilities in woonsocket  ri  continued participation at select industry trade shows  trade and consumer advertising  as well as enhanced internet based promotional activities 
customer service is a critical component of our marketing strategy 
we maintain an internal customer service department that responds to customer inquiries  investigates and resolves issues and generally assists customers and or consumers 
competition the juvenile product industry has many participants  none of which have dominant market share  though certain companies have disproportionate strength in certain product segments 
we compete with a number of different competitors  depending on the product category  and compete against no single company across all of our product categories 
our largest direct competitors are dorel industries including safety st and cosco brands  evenflo evenflo  gerry  and snugli brands  kid brands  inc  fisher price part of mattel  inc  the first years a subsidiary of tomy corporation and graco a subsidiary of newell rubbermaid 
in addition  we compete in several of our product lines with a number of private companies  such as kidco  inc and munchkin 
the primary methods of competition in the industry consist of product innovation  brand positioning  quality  price timely distribution  and other factors 
our competitive strengths include our product development expertise  our ability to develop innovative new products  relationships with major retailers  and the quality and pricing of our products 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents  licenses and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property 
our patents currently in effect include various design features related to bedrails  infant seats  bouncers  and potty chairs  with several other patents pending for monitors  baby swings  and other 
table of contents items 
the patents expire at various times during the next years 
our focus on continuous product improvement and innovation provides constant strength and renewal of our patent portfolio  well before expiration dates 
we also have license agreements relating to the use of patented technology owned by third parties in certain of our products 
customers our top seven customers together comprised more than of our sales in fiscal and fiscal these customers include babies r us toys r us  wal mart  target  amazon 
com  burlington coat factory  buy buy baby  and k mart 
of these customers  three generated more than of sales for fiscal toys r us  walmart and target 
three customers generated more than of sales for fiscal toys r us  walmart and target 
we have no long term contracts with these customers and because of the concentration of our business with these customers  our success depends on our customers willingness to purchase and provide shelf space for our products 
seasonality we do not see significant variations in seasonal demand for our products 
sales history has exhibited some higher volume at times associated with initial shipments of new products 
these orders usually incorporate enough product inventory to fill each store plus additional amounts to be kept at the customer distribution center 
the timing of these initial shipments varies by customer depending on when they finalize store layouts for the upcoming year  and whether there are any mid year product introductions 
geographic regions in and  north america accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total net sales  the remaining sales were in the united kingdom and all other geographies 
regulatory matters we obtain all necessary regulatory agency approvals for each of our products 
in the us  these approvals may include  among others  one or more of the following consumer product safety commission cpsc  the american society of test methods astm  the juvenile products manufacturing association jpma  the federal communications commission fcc and the food and drug administration fda 
we conduct our own internal testing  which utilizes a foreseeable use and abuse testing method and is designed to subject each product to the worst case scenario 
our products are also frequently tested by independent government certified labs 
insurance we carry a product liability insurance policy that provides us with  of liability coverage with a minimal deductible 
we consult with our insurers to ascertain appropriate liability coverage for our product mix 
we believe our current coverage is adequate for our existing business and will continue to evaluate our coverage in the future in line with our expanding sales and product breadth 

table of contents employees as of december   we employed a total of full time people  of whom work in the headquarters in rhode island 
our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our employee relations to be good

item a 
risk factors if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in those cases  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
the concentration of our business with a base of retail customers that make no binding long term commitments means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major customers could have a significant impact on our business 
a small number of large  retail customers account for a majority of our sales 
in fiscal  babies r us toys r us generated of our total sales  and a total of seven customers accounted for more than of our total sales 
we have no long term contracts with these customers and because of the significant concentration of our business with these customers  our success depends on our customers willingness to continue to purchase and provide shelf space for our products 
an adverse change in our relationship with any of our large customers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
liquidity or other financial problems of our key customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales we make to customers are typically made on credit without collateral 
there is a risk that key customers will not pay  or that payment may be delayed  because of contraction of credit availability to such customers  weak retail sales or other factors beyond our control  which could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts 
in addition  if key customers were to cease doing business or significantly reduce the number of stores operated  it could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our ability to grow and compete will be harmed if we do not successfully satisfy consumer preferences  enhance existing products  develop and introduce new products  and achieve market acceptance of those products 
our business and operating results depend largely upon the appeal of our products to the end user  consumers 
consumer preferences  particularly among parents whom are often the end purchasers of our products  are constantly changing 
our success largely depends on our ability to identify emerging trends in the infant and juvenile health  safety and wellness marketplace  and to design products that address consumer demand and prove safe and cost effective 
our product offerings compete with those of many other larger companies 
many of these companies enjoy broad brand recognition and significant distribution channel relationships  and as a result our market position is always at risk 

table of contents our ability to maintain and increase our current market share will depend upon our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and satisfy these preferences  enhance existing products  develop and introduce new products and establish and grow distribution channels for these products  and ultimately achieve market acceptance of these products 
an inability to develop and introduce planned new products or product lines in a timely and cost effective manner may damage our business 
in developing new products and product lines  we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions 
when we state that we will introduce  or anticipate introducing  a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development  implementation  and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture  source and ship new products in a timely manner and on a cost effective basis to meet constantly changing customer demands 
the risk is also heightened by the sophistication of certain products we are designing  in terms of combining digital and analog technologies  utilizing digital media to a greater degree  and providing greater innovation and product differentiation 
unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process  significant increases in the planned cost of development  or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or  in some situations  may cause a product introduction to be discontinued 
the intense competition in our markets could reduce our net sales and profitability 
we operate in a highly competitive market and compete with several large domestic and foreign companies and with other producers of infant and juvenile products 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us 
in addition  we may face competition from new participants in our markets because the infant and juvenile product industry has low barriers to entry 
we experience price competition for our products  competition for shelf space at retailers and competition for licenses  all of which may increase in the future 
if we cannot compete successfully in the future  our net sales and profitability will likely decline 
we rely on external financing to help fund our operations 
covenants in our debt agreements may affect our liquidity or limit our ability to complete acquisitions  incur debt  make investments  sell assets  merge or complete other significant transactions 
in order to meet our working capital needs  we rely on our revolving credit facility for working capital 
in  we entered into a new credit agreement expiring in  which provides for a committed asset based revolving credit facility and a loan agreement for a million secured term loan 
these credit agreements contains certain covenants that place limitations on or restrict a number of our activities  including our ability to incur additional debt  create liens on our assets or make guarantees  make certain investments or loans  pay dividends  or dispose of or sell assets or enter into a merger or similar transaction 
in addition  our debt agreements contain financial covenants that were set at the time we entered into the agreement 
our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations  causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants 
these restrictive covenants may limit our ability to 
table of contents engage in acts that may be in our best long term interests 
non compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility  a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations 
if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default 
there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms  or at all 
deviations from expected results of operations and expected cash requirements could result in a failure to meet financial covenants under our debt agreements which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
any significant deviation in actual results from our expected results of operations  any significant deviation in the timing of material expenditures from current estimates  any significant business or product acquisitions  or other significant unanticipated expenses could result in our not meeting our financial covenants under the terms of our credit facility and term loan and the lenders could declare a default  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if actual events  circumstances  outcomes and amounts differ from judgments  assumptions and estimates made or used in determining the amount of certain assets including the amount of recoverability of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities including accruals for income taxes and liabilities and or other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements  it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if access to our credit facility is limited or terminated  our liquidity would be constrained  affecting our operations and growth prospects  and we would need to seek additional equity or debt financing 
there is no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms or at all 
furthermore  any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants that could impede our ability to effectively operate and grow our business in the future 
we are dependent on key personnel  and our ability to grow and compete in our industry will be harmed if we do not retain the continued services of our key personnel  or we fail to identify  hire  and retain additional qualified personnel 
we are dependent on the efforts of our management team  particularly our chief executive officer  and the loss of services of members of our management team with substantial experience in the infant and juvenile health  safety and wellness markets could have an adverse effect on our business 
if any members of management leave  their departure could adversely affect our ability to design new products and to maintain and grow the business 
in addition  if we expect to grow our operations  it will be necessary for us to attract and retain additional qualified personnel 
the market for qualified and talented product development personnel in the consumer goods market  and specifically in the infant and juvenile health  safety and wellness products market  is intensely competitive 
if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel as needed  the growth of our operations could be slowed or hampered 
we rely on foreign suppliers in asia to manufacture the majority of our products  and any adverse change in our relationship with our suppliers could harm our business 
we rely on numerous third party suppliers located in asia for the manufacture of most of our products 
while we believe that alternative suppliers could be located if required  our product sourcing could be affected if any of these suppliers do not continue to manufacture our products in required quantities or at all  or with the required levels of quality 
we enter into purchase orders with our foreign suppliers and do not enter into any long term supply contracts 
in addition  difficulties 
table of contents encountered by these suppliers  such as fire  accident  natural disasters  outbreaks of contagious diseases  or political unrest  could halt or disrupt production at the affected locations  resulting in delay or cancellation of orders 
any of these events could result in delayed deliveries by us of our products  causing reduced sales and harm to our reputation and brand name 
increases in the cost of materials or labor used to manufacture our products could decrease our profitability and therefore negatively impact our business and financial condition 
because our products are manufactured by third party suppliers  we do not directly purchase the materials used in the manufacture of our products 
however  the prices paid by us to these suppliers could increase if raw materials  labor  or other costs increase 
if we cannot pass these increases along to our customers  our profitability will be adversely affected 
because we rely on foreign suppliers and we sell in foreign markets  we are subject to numerous risks associated with international business that could increase our costs or disrupt the supply of our products  resulting in a negative impact on our business and financial condition 
our international operations subject us to risks  including economic and political instability  restrictive actions by foreign governments  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting intellectual property rights  changes in import duties or import or export restrictions  timely shipping of product and unloading of product through west coast ports  as well as timely truck delivery to our warehouses  complications in complying with the laws and policies of the united states affecting the importation of goods  including duties  quotas  and taxes  and complications in complying with trade and foreign tax laws 
any of these events or circumstances could disrupt the supply of our products or increase our expenses 
because of the importance of our international sourcing of manufacturing to our business  our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our global operations 
intellectual property claims relating to our products could increase our costs and adversely affect our business 
we have  from time to time  received claims of alleged infringement of patents relating to certain of our products  and we may face similar claims in the future 
these claims relate to alleged patent infringement and are primarily the result of newly issued patents that were not in force when we initially brought the subject products to market 
the defense of intellectual property claims can be costly and time consuming  even in circumstances where the claim is without merit 
we may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in order to resolve these types of claims 
in addition  these claims could materially harm our brand name  reputation and operations 
product liability  product recalls  and other claims relating to the use of our products could increase our costs 
because we produce infant and juvenile health  safety and wellness consumer products  we face product liability risks relating to the use by consumers of our products 
we also must comply with a variety of product safety and product testing regulations 
in particular  our products are subject to the consumer product safety act  the federal hazardous substances act fhsa and the consumer 
table of contents product safety improvement act cpsia  which empower the consumer product safety commission the cpsc  to take action against hazards presented by consumer products 
with expanded authority under the cpsia  the cpsc has and continues to adopt new regulations for safety and products testing that apply to our products 
these new regulations have or likely will significantly increase the regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and sale of children products and increase the potential penalties for noncompliance with applicable regulations 
the cpsc has the authority to exclude from the market and recall certain consumer products that are found to be potentially hazardous 
consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in canada and europe  as well as certain other countries 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  or if we face product liability claims  we may be subject to damage awards or settlement costs that exceed any available insurance coverage and we may incur significant costs in complying with recall requirements 
furthermore  concerns about potential liability may lead us to recall voluntarily selected products 
for instance in  we undertook voluntary action to re label our audio video nursery monitors and recorded a charge in connection with the settlement of outstanding litigation related to our analog video nursery monitors 
complying with existing or any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business 
similarly  increased penalties for non compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations 
we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities  that  if not identified  could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by nondeductible equity based compensation  earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates  transfer pricing adjustments  not meeting the terms and conditions of tax holidays or incentives  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in actual results versus our estimates  or changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles or interpretations thereof  and taxes relating to deemed dividends resulting from foreign guarantees made by certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  like other companies  we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
while we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  there can be no assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
a material impairment in the carrying value of acquired goodwill or other intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating results and net worth 
a portion of our assets are intangible  which are reviewed on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the current fair value  the asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value  resulting in a non cash charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment is determined 
events and conditions that could result in impairment include a sustained drop in the market price of our common stock  increased competition or loss of market share  product innovation or obsolescence  or a decline of our business related to acquired companies 
in  we recorded an aggregate non cash impairment charge of  consisting of a write down of goodwill of  and a write down of a portion of intangible assets of  we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any future impairment of assets 

table of contents we may experience difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition targets and integrating strategic acquisitions 
in the past  we have made strategic acquisitions and continue to pursue acquisitions that are consistent with our mission and enable us to leverage our competitive strengths 
while we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions  we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions  obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms  obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future 
an inability to identify future acquisitions could limit our future growth 
in addition  the integration of operations of those companies we do acquire into our operations involves a number of risks  including the acquired business may experience losses that could adversely affect our profitability  unanticipated costs relating to the integration of acquired businesses may increase our expenses  possible failure to obtain any necessary consents to the transfer of licenses or other agreements of the acquired business  possible failure to maintain customer  licensor and other relationships after the closing of the transaction of the acquired business  difficulties in achieving planned cost savings and synergies may increase our expenses or decrease our net sales  diversion of management attention could impair their ability to effectively manage our business operations  and unanticipated management or operational problems or liabilities may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 
in addition  any future acquisitions or investments may result in issuances of dilutive equity securities  which may be sold at a discount to market price  impairment of goodwill  use of significant amounts of cash  the incurrence of debt  the assumption of significant liabilities  unfavorable financing terms  large one time expenses  and the creation of intangible assets  including goodwill  the write down of which may result in significant charges to earnings 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
when we or our competitors announce new products  experience quarterly fluctuations in operating results  announce strategic relationships  acquisitions or dispositions  change earnings estimates  published financial results or other material news  our stock price is often affected 
the volatility of our stock price may be accentuated during periods of low volume trading  which may require a stockholder wishing to sell a large number of shares to do so in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock 

table of contents we rely on information technology in our operations  and any material failure  inadequacy  interruption  or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 
we rely on information technology systems across our operations  including for management of its supply chain  sale and delivery of its products  and various other processes and transactions 
our ability to effectively manage our business and coordinate the production  distribution  and sale of its products depends on the reliability and capacity of these systems and in some instances third party service providers 
the failure of these systems to operate effectively due to service interruptions  problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems  or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product sales and reduced efficiency of our operations  and capital investments could be required to remediate the problem 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may limit the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management  which may not be in your best interests 
there are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us  even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests  and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
these provisions include the following our certificate of incorporation provides for three classes of directors with the term of office of one class expiring each year  commonly referred to as a staggered board 
by preventing stockholders from voting on the election of more than one class of directors at any annual meeting of stockholders  this provision may have the effect of keeping the current members of our board of directors in control for a longer period of time than stockholders may desire  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred stock issued  which would allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or change in control  and our bylaws require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations 
additionally  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which  in general  imposes restrictions upon acquirers of or more of our stock 
finally  the board of directors may in the future adopt other protective measures  such as a stockholder rights plan  which could delay  deter or prevent a change of control

outlook our business  financial condition and results of operations have and may continue to be affected by various economic factors 
although other factors will likely impact us  including some we do not foresee and those disclosed in item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k for the year 
table of contents ended december   we believe our performance in will continue to be affected by the following economic climate 
periods of global economic uncertainty  such as the recession experienced in and much of  as well as recent market disruptions  can lead to reduced consumer and business spending 
the current economic climate continues to affect our business in direct and indirect ways  including reduced consumer demand for our products  tighter inventory management by retailers  reduced profit margins due to pricing pressures from mass merchant retailers and a sales mix favoring lower margin products 
in addition  reduced access to credit has and may continue to adversely affect consumers who desire to purchase our products from retailers and the ability of our own customers to pay us 
retail market conditions 
our industry is very competitive  with increasing pressure from mass merchant retailers on pricing in reaction to perceived lack of consumer confidence 
these customers continue to seek favorable pricing and increased promotional activity from us and we expect this trend will continue into we continue to seek to reduce pressure on gross margins through a variety of methods  including reducing manufacturing costs and locating lower cost sources of supply 
we have also begun raising prices on certain products and phasing out lower margin products 
however  we may not be able to increase prices or decline requests for mark downs and or other allowances from some of our larger  retail customers due to market and competitive factors 
in addition  as we focus on our business strategy of building our brands  we expect to move away from licensing arrangements with third parties to selling more summer branded products 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates this summary of our critical accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements and notes are representations of our management  which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity 
these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our financial statements 
some of these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates were made 
however  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
revenue recognition we record revenue when all of the following occur persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales are recorded net of provisions for returns and allowances  cash discounts and markdowns 
we base our estimates for discounts  returns and allowances on negotiated customer terms  and historical experience 
these estimates are subject to variability  as actual deductions taken by customers may be different from the estimates recorded 
customers do not have the right to return products unless the products are defective 
we record a reduction of sales for estimated future defective product deductions based on historical experience 
sales incentives or other consideration given by us to customers that are considered adjustments of the selling price of its products  such as markdowns  are reflected as reductions of revenue 
sales incentives and other consideration that represent costs incurred by us for assets or services received  
table of contents such as the appearance of our products in a customer national circular ad co op advertising  are reflected as selling and marketing expenses in the accompanying statements of income 
trade receivables trade receivables are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts 
on a periodic basis  we estimate doubtful accounts based on historical bad debt  factors related to specific customers ability to pay and current economic trends 
we write off accounts receivable against the allowance when a balance is determined to be uncollectible 
we do not accrue interest on trade receivables 
a receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within the credit terms on the account  typically days for most customers 
we will turn an account over for collection around days past due 
accounts are considered uncollectible if no payments are received to days after they have been turned over for collection 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts represents adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reduces gross trade receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the allowance is based on our assessment of the business environment  customers financial condition  historical trends  customer payment practices  receivable aging and customer disputes 
we will continue to proactively review our credit risks and adjust customer terms to reflect the current environment 
inventory valuation inventory is comprised of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost  inclusive of freight and duty  or market net realizable value using the first in  first out fifo method 
our warehousing costs are charged to expense as incurred 
we regularly review slow moving and excess inventory  and write down inventories as appropriate 
management uses estimates to record write downs based on its review of inventory by product category  including length of time on hand and estimates of future orders for each product 
changes in consumer preferences  as well as demand for products  customer buying patterns and inventory management could impact the inventory valuation 
impairment of long lived assets with finite lives we review long lived assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying amount exceeds both the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition and the assets fair value 
long lived assets include property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets 
the amount of impairment loss  if any  is charged by the company to current operations 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with accounting guidance that requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested annually for impairment and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company annual impairment testing is conducted in the fourth quarter of every year 
the company tests indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the asset fair value to its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  the excess of the 
table of contents carrying amount over fair value is recognized as an impairment charge and the adjusted carrying amount becomes the assets new accounting basis 
management also evaluates the remaining useful life of an intangible asset that is not being amortized each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if an intangible asset that is not being amortized is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life  it is amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life 
the company tests goodwill for impairment using a two step process 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of its single reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the fair value of the single reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  the goodwill is considered not impaired  thus rendering unnecessary the second step in impairment testing 
if the fair value of the single reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed in which the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the single reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the single reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 
income taxes income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method of accounting 
under the asset and liability method  a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards 
the measurement of deferred income tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance  if necessary  to recognize future tax benefits only to the extent  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that such benefit will be realized 
the company recognized interest and penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense 
no interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were accrued at december  our federal tax returns for have been audited by the us internal revenue service 
all audit adjustments have been recorded without significant impact on our results of operations 
on a global basis  the open tax years subject to examination by major taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates is between two to six years 
results of operations the following table presents selected condensed consolidated financial information for summer infant  inc and its subsidiaries for the years ended december  and year ended december  year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit general and administration expenses selling expenses depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill and intangible assets net operating income loss interest expense  net provision benefit for income taxes net income loss 
table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales increased from  in the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to organic growth resulting from increased distribution of existing products throughout our growing customer base  introduction of new products  and international growth 
sales increased in the furniture  feeding  safety  nursery  and play categories  offset  in part by lower sales in the monitor and gear categories year over year 
gross profit decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decline in gross profit and as a percent of sales is attributed to an unfavorable product mix  in particular  an increase in lower margin sales of furniture products and a decrease in sales of higher margin monitor products as well as a one time adjustment to cost of goods sold for the write off of obsolete inventory acquired from born free 
in addition  markdown and returned goods allowances were higher during the year 
general and administrative expenses decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  in  the company incurred a lawsuit settlement  acquisition related costs  as well as other one time charges that did not repeat in in addition  the company began to benefit from overhead cost reductions initiated at the end of the second quarter of selling expenses increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to higher promotional costs related to customer cooperative advertising and placement of consumer ads  higher royalty payments under licensing agreements  and an increase in other variable selling costs associated with higher sales 
depreciation and amortization increased from  in the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to the depreciation of a higher base of short lived assets consisting primarily of new product prototypes added in and early due to the sustained decrease in our results of operations below forecasts and stock price during the third quarter of  we undertook a goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis and engaged a third party to assist management in valuing goodwill and other intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet in the third quarter of as a result  management determined that the estimated fair value of certain indefinite lived intangibles and implied fair value of our goodwill were lower than their respective carrying value  and the company recorded an estimated aggregate non cash impairment charge of  in the non cash impairment charge consisted of a write down of goodwill of  and a write down of a portion of intangible assets of  these charges affected our financial condition and results of operations for  however  they have no impact on our day to day operations or liquidity and will not result in any future cash expenditures 
interest expense increased from  in the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  interest expense increased as a result of higher interest rates and higher average debt levels on our credit facility in effect for for the year ended december   we recorded a  provision for income taxes on  of pretax income  resulting in a tax rate for the year 
for the year ended december   we recorded a  million tax benefit 
the tax benefit in is primarily attributable to a  benefit recorded related to the deferred tax adjustment resulting from the impairment of goodwill and intangible asset charge taken during the year 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we generally fund our operations and working capital needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
through  our sales increased significantly  which led to a substantial increase in working capital requirements  specifically accounts receivable and inventory 
in a typical cash flow cycle  inventory is purchased to meet expected demand plus a safety stock 
because the majority of our suppliers are based in asia  inventory takes from three to four weeks to arrive from asia to the various distribution points we maintain in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
payment terms for these vendors are approximately days from the date the product ships from asia  therefore we are generally paying for the product a short time after it is physically received in the united states 
in turn  sales to customers generally have payment terms of to days  resulting in an accounts receivable and increasing the amount of cash required to fund working capital 
in order to bridge the gap between paying our suppliers and receiving payment from our customers for goods sold  we rely on our credit facility 
the majority of capital expenditures are for tools related to new product introductions 
we receive indications from retailers generally around the middle of each year as to what products the retailer will be taking into its product line for the upcoming year 
based on these indications  we will then acquire the tools required to build the products 
in most cases the payments for the tools are spread out over a three to four month period
