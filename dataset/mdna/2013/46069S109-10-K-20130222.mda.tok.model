overview we focus our efforts on the high performance analog  mixed signal and power management markets of the semiconductor industry 
digital and analog semiconductor components are the basic ingredient in today s electronic devices 
in contrast to the binary nature of digital components  analog components monitor  evaluate and modify electrical signals and strengths allowing them to deal with basic and essential properties such as heat  touch  light and sound 
the high performance analog  mixed signal  and power management markets are distinguished by its highly differentiated and technologically advanced products which can be building blocks for more complex circuits or highly integrated for specific applications 
we utilize a week fiscal year  ending on the nearest friday to december the next week fiscal year will occur in with an extra week to be reported in our second quarter 
all years presented are fiscal years and contain weeks

we have modified end market data below in the years ended december  and december  to conform to the presentation in the year ended december   which we believe better reflects the different characteristics of our end markets 
geographical revenue in millions and of revenue asia pacific north america europe and other total revenue  cost of revenue and gross margin revenue our revenue for was million  a decrease of million or from the revenue decrease was due to broad based declines across all end markets 
revenue in the industrial infrastructure market decreased from levels  revenue in the personal computing market decreased and revenue in the consumer market decreased from levels 
our revenue for was million  a decrease of million or from the revenue decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue to the industrial infrastructure end market and the consumer end markets  partially offset by increased revenue to the personal computing end market 
revenue to industrial and infrastructure decreased from levels  while revenue to the consumer markets decreased from levels 
revenue to the personal computing end market increased  primarily due to strength in the notebook market 

table of contents revenue by end market in millions and of revenue industrial infrastructure personal computing consumer total in aggregate  lower overall unit demand in decreased revenue by approximately million from levels and a decrease in asps for the related product mix decreased revenue from levels by approximately million 
of this revenue decrease approximately million came from our sales to customers in the asia pacific region  million came from sales to customers in north america and million came from sales to customers in europe and other countries 
in aggregate  lower overall unit demand in decreased revenue by approximately million from levels and a decrease in asps decreased revenue from levels by approximately million 
of this revenue decline approximately million came from our sales to customers in the asia pacific region  million came from sales to customers in north america and million came from sales to customers in europe and other countries 
we anticipate that our revenue from asia pacific region customers will continue to grow in percentage terms as that region leads in the manufacture of the finished goods in which our products are used 
end market demand for those products is global  and therefore dependent on aggregate global macroeconomic conditions such as government budget and debt crises  personal incomes and business activity and not necessarily on asian and pacific rim regional economic factors 
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue consists primarily of purchased materials and services  labor  overhead and depreciation associated with manufacturing pertaining to products sold 
our gross margin decreased by basis points in from the decrease was primarily due to product sales mix changes at the product family level along with lower production volume when compared to fixed overhead costs charged to cost of revenue 
our gross margin decreased by basis points in from the decrease was primarily due to product sales mix changes at the product family level 
generally  our personal computing and consumer products have lower gross margins than our industrial and infrastructure products 
we strive to improve gross margins from their present levels by introducing new high margin products and cost saving opportunities in our manufacturing chain  however  recent declines in production volume has affected per unit cost  exerting downward pressure on margins 
operating costs and expenses research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses of employees engaged in product process research  design and development activities  as well as related subcontracting activities  masks  design automation software  engineering wafers  and technology license agreement expenses 
our r d expenses decreased by or million to million in compared to million for during the last two quarters of and throughout  we implemented substantial cost saving initiatives to optimize and integrate acquired companies and to reduce r d spending 
we realigned our resources to focus on our primary future growth drivers while continuing to invest in products aimed at the broad industrial market 

table of contents our r d expenses increased by or million to million in compared to million for while we continue to invest in r d to pursue future growth  we implemented cost saving initiatives in the third and fourth quarters of to optimize and integrate acquired companies and to maintain r d spending at approximately levels 
we believe that a continued commitment to r d is essential to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in r d 
as we continue to move to more advanced process technologies  our mask and engineering wafer costs are becoming more complex and expensive  and will therefore increasingly represent a greater proportion of total r d expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses of employees engaged in selling and marketing our products as well as the salaries and expenses required to perform our human resources  finance  legal  executive and other administrative functions 
our sg a expenses decreased by or million to million in compared to million for the decrease in was primarily due to lower labor costs 
our sg a expenses increased by or million to million in compared to million for the increase in was primarily driven by higher labor costs and supplies from additional employees gained in acquisitions during and increased sales related incentives during the first quarter of amortization of purchased intangibles our amortization of purchased intangibles was million in  million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to additional amortization on in process r d projects acquired from techwell  inc techwell and completed during the first quarter of the decrease in from levels was due to intangibles that became fully amortized during our purchased intangibles  which are definite lived assets  are amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years 
income from ip agreements income from ip agreements was million  net of costs  and relate to a million settlement of a trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement dispute with another semiconductor company and a million sale of several patents 
restructuring and related costs our restructuring and related costs were million in and million in the and restructuring charges consisted primarily of severance costs and were part of our ongoing efforts to optimize operations and conclude the integrations of acquired companies 
acquisition related costs our acquisition related costs were million in and million in acquisition related costs relate to the acquisition of techwell in the second quarter of other income and expenses interest income our interest income decreased to million in compared to million in and million in interest income decreased in and due to decreased average cash and investment balances and continued low interest rates 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our remaining auction rate securities 

table of contents interest expense and fees our interest expense and fees decreased to million in compared to million in and million in included in interest expense is approximately million reclassification of losses on settlement of our interest rate swaps  previously recorded as unrealized loss in other comprehensive income 
excluding these losses  interest expense and fees in decreased from levels due to lower long term debt balances 
the increase from levels was due to interest and fees on the long term debt agreement entered into during to facilitate the acquisition of techwell 
loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended december   we extinguished the remaining portion of our million six year term loan facility and wrote off million in unamortized loan fees 
gain loss on deferred compensation investments we have a liability for a non qualified deferred compensation plan 
we maintain a portfolio of approximately million in mutual fund investments and corporate owned life insurance under the plan 
changes in the fair value of the asset are recorded as a gain loss on deferred compensation investments and changes in the fair value of the liability are recorded as a component of compensation expense 
in general  the compensation benefit expense is substantially offset by the gains and losses on the investment 
during  we recorded a gain on deferred compensation investments of million and compensation expense of million 
during  we recorded a loss on deferred compensation investments of million and a decrease in compensation expense of million 
during  we recorded a gain on deferred compensation investments of million and compensation expense of million 
loss on sale of investments during  we sold our remaining portfolio of auction rate securities ars for a net loss of million  before taxes 
during  we recorded a million loss on the sale of certain investments  before taxes 
other than temporary impairment losses during  we recorded impairment charges of million  before taxes  on certain ars whose decline in fair value was determined to be other than temporary 
the impairments related to credit rating downgrades on specific investments in the ars portfolio 
income tax expense benefit our income tax expense was million for compared to an income tax benefit of million in income tax for included a million charge related to a transfer pricing tax election to repatriate cash in connection with the internal revenue service irs audit of tax years and excluding these unusual items  the effective tax rate was further increased due to the expiration of the federal r d tax credit and a greater portion of income in higher tax jurisdictions 
income tax expense for included a benefit of million primarily related to the re measurement of our unrecognized tax benefits and a tax benefit of million related to incremental prior year federal and state r d credits net of a valuation allowance on the state portion of these credits 
our income tax benefit was million for compared to an income tax expense of million in income tax expense for included a benefit of million primarily related to the re measurement of our unrecognized tax benefits and a tax benefit of million related to incremental prior year federal and state r d credits net of a valuation allowance on the state portion of these credits 
income tax expense for included a million charge due primarily to a provision established upon the completion of fieldwork on a multi year irs examination  offset by a tax benefit of million resulting from the donation of a portion of our facilities in palm bay 
in determining net loss income  we estimate and exercise judgment in the calculation of tax expense and tax liabilities  and in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of assets and liabilities 

table of contents in the ordinary course of business  the ultimate tax outcome of many transactions and calculations is uncertain  as the calculation of tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax laws in the united states  malaysia and other jurisdictions 
we recognize liabilities for additional taxes that may be due on tax audit issues based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of those issues 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  the final outcome may be different than amounts we estimate 
such determinations could have a material impact on the income tax expense benefit  effective tax rate and operating results in the period they occur 
in addition  the effective tax rate reflected in our forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially impact our estimates 
on january   president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of which included an extension of the federal r d credit retroactively to and prospectively through we expect to recognize approximately million of tax benefit related to the reinstatement of the r d credit in the first quarter of backlog our product sales are made pursuant to purchase orders that are generally booked up to six months in advance of delivery 
our standard terms and conditions of sale provide that these orders may not be cancelled or rescheduled thirty days prior to the most current crd for standard products and ninety days prior to crd for semi custom and custom products 
backlog is influenced by several factors  including end market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times 
additionally  we believe backlog can fall faster than consumption rates in periods of weak end market demand since production lead times can be shorter 
conversely  we believe backlog can grow faster than consumption in periods of strong end market demand as production and delivery times increase and some customers may increase orders in excess of their current consumption to reduce their own risk of production disruptions 
our backlog for sales to distributors is valued at list price  which can be substantially higher than the prices ultimately recognized as revenue 
considering these practices and our experience  backlog alone cannot be consistently relied on to predict actual revenue for future periods 
our six month backlog as of december  was million compared to million as of december  and as of december  
table of contents restructuring plan on february   we announced a restructuring initiative designed to prioritize sales and development efforts  strengthen financial performance and improve cash flow 
the restructuring plans will be substantially completed during the first quarter of and are expected to reduce annual operating expenses by approximately million 
the refocusing effort will reduce the company s global work force by approximately 
costs savings are expected to be achieved through reductions in work force and increased focus on new product development efforts 
we expect to recognize restructuring related charges of approximately million  consisting primarily of employee severance benefits  during the first quarter of the amount of the restructuring charges is an estimate  and the actual charges may vary materially based on various factors including  but not limited to  the extent of a reduction in force and changes in management assumptions 
impact of inflation and changing prices the semiconductor industry has  for several decades  experienced a phenomenon of continual decline in sales prices per unit 
this phenomenon brings unique challenges to managing our business 
in order to increase revenues  we must continually introduce new products that support higher sales prices or increase the units of products sold 
this leads to capacity and production management issues and requires a large investment in r d to regularly introduce new products that are differentiated based on qualities other than price and enable us to increase our average unit selling prices 
at the same time we are faced with a continued increase in the complexity and cost of r d and many fixed costs in our business that increase at the same rate of general inflation in the economy and must be managed carefully and aggressively in order to maintain operating margins 
these characteristics of revenue pressure from selling price  the need to invest heavily in r d and inflation prone fixed costs are expected to continue 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations and commitments the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations as of december  in millions thereafter total future minimum lease commitments open capital asset purchase commitments open raw material purchase commitments tax liability arising from utbs other purchase commitments total our future minimum lease commitments consist primarily of leases for buildings and other real property 
open capital asset purchase commitments primarily include leasehold improvements  production equipment for the expansion of our palm bay facility  and other equipment 
open raw material purchase commitments are for externally produced wafers and includes minimum purchase requirements as part of a guaranteed capacity agreement with one of our wafer suppliers 
the unrecognized tax benefits utbs relate primarily to the intercompany pricing of goods and services between different tax jurisdictions and are recorded within income taxes payable on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base  the success  timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market  revenue growth or decline  and potential acquisitions 
we believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next months domestically and in our foreign operations  including our dividend program  the requisite capital expenditures for the maintenance of worldwide manufacturing capacity  working capital requirements and potential acquisitions  strategic investments or a stock buyback program 
as of december   approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
due to our transfer pricing tax election in connection with our irs audit  we have provided for federal and state taxation at approximately and will not be subject to further taxation upon repatriation 
we do not expect to repatriate foreign accumulated earnings in the foreseeable future  however  should that occur  we would be required to pay us taxes and foreign withholding taxes  not currently provided for 
as of december   we have million of borrowing capacity under our five year revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility matures on september  and is payable in full upon maturity 
under the facility  million is available for the issuance of standby letters of credit  million is available as swing line loans and million is available for multicurrency borrowings 
amounts repaid under the facility may be re borrowed 
the facility currently bears interest at over one month libor but is variable based on our leverage ratio as described in the credit agreement in exhibit as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable covenants of the above mentioned credit agreement 
our primary sources and uses of cash during the three years ended december  are presented in this summarized table in millions year ended december  december  december  sources uses of cash existing business performance and activities operating activities  including working capital changes cash flows from stock plans issuance of long term debt issuance of long term debt  net of fees other uses of cash business acquisitions  net capital expenditures  net of sale proceeds repayments of debt repurchase of common stock dividends paid cash investment management activities net proceeds from investments and foreign exchange effect net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents in  our operational cash flows were million compared to million in  a decrease of million  due primarily to the decline in operating income and million paid to the irs to settle the tax year audits 
we used approximately million for capital expenditures 
we repaid million of debt  repurchased million of common stock  and returned million to shareholders in the form of dividends 
net proceeds from investment balances were million in  resulting in net cash used of million overall 
investment balances declined due to the maturity of bank time deposits 
we strive to continually improve the cash flows from our existing business activities and return a substantial portion of that cash flow to shareholders 
we continue to maintain and improve our existing business performance with necessary capital expenditures and acquisitions that may further improve our business and return on investment 
cash  stock  debt or a combination thereof may be issued to fund additional acquisitions to grow our business 

table of contents non cash working capital trade accounts receivable  less valuation allowances  decreased by million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  this decrease primarily reflects the decrease in revenue 
inventories decreased by million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  inventories decreased from as a result of utilization of inventory on hand 
we maintain stock of certain high volume products to ensure our lead times remain within customer expectations 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  net of sales proceeds  were million for  million for  and million for capital expenditures have been focused primarily on planned expansion of our palm bay facility and increases to test capacity for new product lines 
cash flow from stock plans cash flow from stock plans including exercises of options  tax payments on awards and sales under our espp was million in  compared to million received in and million received in we have changed the mix of new share based incentive grants to a larger proportion of awards than options 
awards do not yield cash proceeds from an exercise event as do options  but may result in tax payments on shares withheld 
additionally  exercises are decisions of grantees and are influenced by the level of our stock price and by other considerations of grantees 
the recent decline in stock price has resulted in many of our options being underwater with exercise prices in excess of the current stock price 
while the level of cash inflow from exercises is difficult to forecast  we believe it will remain a source of cash 
dividends on common stock in october  our board of directors declared a dividend of per share of common stock 
we paid dividends of million on november  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on november  in january  our board of directors declared a dividend of per share of common stock 
the dividend will be paid on february  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on february  transactions with related and certain other parties none 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the following five accounting estimation processes to be critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the allowances for collection of trade receivables receivable allowance and distributor  oem and warranty allowances other allowances  allowances for excess or obsolete inventory inventory allowances  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  and fair value of equity based compensation 
these estimates involve estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective and require certain assumptions that  if incorrect  could create changes  including adverse ones  to our consolidated statement of operations and financial position 

table of contents receivables allowance and other allowances our receivables allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables 
since the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding cannot be known until the future  we rely primarily on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have been typically infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being well below of sales 
in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not currently indicate the inability to pay but could have such an inability in the future  we maintain an allowance based on a month rolling average of write offs  which as of december  was less than of our gross trade receivables balance 
we also maintain specific allowances for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible for various reasons  such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify the accounts that are more likely to have collection problems 
we then provide an allowance for a portion or all of the customer s balance based on our evaluation of the ultimate collectability of the account 
shipments to distributors are made under agreements which provide for certain pricing adjustments referred to as ship and debit and limited product return privileges  under a stock rotation provision 
many of our sales to distributors are invoiced at list price and the final price is set via ship and debit credits at the time of resale 
the distributor may also receive certain price protection on a percentage of unsold inventories they hold 
accordingly  we make estimates of price adjustments based upon inventory held by distributors as of the balance sheet date and record this as a distributor allowance 
we rely on historical distributor allowances to estimate these adjustments 
distributors may also receive allowances for certain parts returned under a stock rotation provision of the distributor agreement 
we estimate the stock rotation provision based on the percentage of sales made to distributors and historical returns 
distributor allowances were million as of december  and as of december  allowances for our oem customers totaled million as of december  and million as of december  warranty allowances  returns for which there are product performance claims  totaled million as of december  and million as of december  in summary  our allowances for trade receivables and other allowances are as follows in millions december  december  trade receivables billed at list price receivables allowance other allowances ship and debit  stock rotation and warranty trade receivables  net of allowances inventory allowances we record our inventories at standard costs  which approximates the lower of actual cost or market 
as the ultimate market value that we will realize through sales on our inventory cannot be known with exact certainty  we rely on past sales experience and future sales forecasts to project it 
in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify certain inventory as either excess or obsolete 
these classifications are maintained for all classes of inventory  although raw materials are seldom deemed excess or obsolete 
we classify inventory as obsolete if we have withdrawn it from the marketplace or if we have had no sales of the product for the past months and no sales forecasted for the next months 
we provide an allowance for of the standard cost of obsolete inventory 
we conduct reviews of excess inventory on a quarterly basis and reserve a significant portion of the excess inventory 
we classify inventory as excess if we have quantities of product greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months 
we typically retain excess inventory until the inventory is sold or reclassified as obsolete  at which time we may scrap 
for all items identified as excess or obsolete  management reviews the individual facts and circumstances  ie competitive landscape  industry economic conditions  product lifecycles and product cannibalization  specific to that inventory 
inventory allowances totaled approximately million on gross inventory of million as of december  and million on gross inventory of million as of december  
table of contents product demand estimates are a key element in determining inventory allowances 
our estimate of product demand requires significant judgment and is based in part on historical revenue 
historical sales may not accurately predict future demand 
if future demand is ultimately lower than our estimate  we could incur significant additional expenses to provide allowances for and scrap obsolete inventory 
assessment of recoverability of goodwill we perform an annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indications of potential impairment exist 
goodwill is tested under a two step method for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
step one is to identify potential impairment 
we compare the calculated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  no impairment of the goodwill of the reporting unit is indicated and step two is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the amount of impairment loss is the excess of carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be the new accounting basis 
significant judgment is involved in the determination of fair value for the above analysis 
our estimates of fair value are based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market prices 
the use of future discounted cash flows is based on assumptions that are consistent with our estimates of future growth and the strategic plan used to manage the underlying business 
factors requiring significant judgment include assumptions related to future growth rates  discount factors  market multiples and tax rates  amongst other considerations 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur after the annual impairment analysis or an interim impairment analysis  and that impact these assumptions  may result in a future goodwill impairment charge 
for the purposes of the impairment test performed on september   we had three reporting units analog and mixed signal ams  power management  and consumer 
the fair value of the power management and consumer reporting units was substantially in excess of the carrying value of those reporting units 
the fair value of the ams reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 
goodwill allocated to the ams reporting unit as of december  was million 
we performed sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value for the ams reporting unit using the income and market approaches 
a key assumption in our fair value estimate using the income approach is the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
we selected a wacc of for the ams reporting unit 
an increase in the wacc of basis points would have resulted in a fair value that was less than the carrying value 
a key assumption in our market approach was an enterprise value to revenue multiple 
a decrease in the selected revenue multiples would have resulted in a fair value that was less than the carrying value  all other variables remaining constant 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required to determine worldwide income tax liabilities 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate and the actual taxes ultimately payable could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates  in the valuation of deferred tax assets  in tax laws or by material audit assessments  which could affect our profitability 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   our net deferred tax asset amounted to million compared to million as of december  
table of contents applicable guidance requires us to record our tax expense based on various estimates of probabilities of sustaining certain tax positions 
as a result of this and other factors  our tax expense could be volatile  which contributes to volatility in reported financial results 
as of december  and december   our utbs related to uncertain tax positions were million and million  respectively 
fair value of equity based compensation we generally calculate the fair value of an equity based compensation grant compensation cost on the date of grant using a lattice method or  for market based grants  a monte carlo simulation 
the compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the shorter of vesting life or requisite service period 
calculating fair value requires us to estimate certain key assumptions in the valuation model  including expected stock price volatility  the risk free interest rate in the market  the expected life of the option granted and annualized dividend yield 
volatility is one of the most significant determinants of fair value 
we estimate our volatility using the actual historic volatility of our stock price 
we estimate our expected risk free interest rate by using the zero coupon us treasury rate at the time of the grant related to the expected life of the grant 
expected forfeitures must be estimated to offset the compensation cost expected to be recorded in the financial statements 
we estimate forfeitures for the first year of vesting  based on historical information about turnover for each appropriate employee level 
thereafter  as vesting tiers within an option are more frequent until fully vested  forfeitures are no longer estimated but rather recorded as they actually occur 
we estimate the annualized dividend yield by dividing the current annualized dividend by the closing stock price on the date of grant 
calculating fair value for our options and awards that have a performance measurement element to them also requires us to estimate the likely actual performance before the performance is complete 
we do this by adjusting the forfeiture rate to include the expectation of actual performance at the time the calculation is made for purposes of amortizing the compensation appropriately 
such performance based instruments  depending upon the term of required performance  may need to be re measured as frequently as quarterly 
we base these estimates of key assumptions on historical information using judgment regarding future expectations 
we re examine our assumptions on a regular basis 
when such examinations of the key assumptions lead to significant changes to the calculation inputs  it can have a material effect on the amount of equity based compensation that will be recognized in aggregate or in any period 
this may mean more volatility in our reported earnings due to changes in facts and circumstances surrounding our use of equity compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the standard requires additional disclosure to enhance the comparability of us gaap and international financial reporting standards financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
this standard provided additional guidance on the scope of asu retrospective application is required and the guidance concerns disclosure only 
it will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal year and will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
under asu  an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts 
asu does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
asu will be effective for our first quarter of fiscal year and will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit markets have tightened as a result of the financial crises in recent years  resulting in lower liquidity in many financial markets and excess volatility in fixed income  credit and equity markets 
we could experience a number of resulting effects  including product delays due to effects experienced by key suppliers  reduced orders and payments as customers are affected by tighter credit markets and or insolvency  decreased investing and financing options in a tighter market  increased expenses  increased impairments resulting from lower orders and sales as customers experience difficulties obtaining financing  and volatility and extreme changes in the earnings and fair value of our investments 
moreover  in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments  entered into for purposes other than trading purposes  to manage our exposure to these risks 
our cash equivalents and investments are subject to three market risks interest rate risk  credit risk and liquidity risk 
our investments as of december   are primarily held in bank time deposits 
as of december   we had open foreign exchange contracts to economically hedge forecasted foreign cash flow commitments up to six months 
as our hedges on forecasted foreign cash flow commitments do not qualify for hedge accounting  gains and losses on changes in the fair market value of the foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from economic hedges are classified in the statements of operations consistent with the accounting classification of the items being economically hedged 
the derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
we believe our cash flow hedges have been economically effective 
the table below summarizes our foreign exchange contract activity over the past two years in millions year ended december  december  realized loss on foreign exchange contracts unrealized loss gain on foreign exchange contracts purchases and sales of foreign exchange contracts notional amount of open contracts as of year end fair value of open contracts as of year end a substantial majority of our revenues and liabilities outside the us are billed  collected  and paid in us dollars 
therefore  we do not believe we have material risk to currency rates
