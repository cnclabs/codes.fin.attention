item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview iridex corporation is a leading worldwide provider of therapeutic based laser systems  delivery devices and consumable instrumentation used to treat sight threatening eye diseases in ophthalmology 
in february  we sold our aesthetics business to cutera  inc we view this as a significant step forward in our strategy because it allows us to focus solely on our ophthalmology business which is our core strength 
management believes that this path affords the company with the best opportunity for long term profitable growth 
in accordance with us gaap we have disclosed the financial results from our aesthetics business as discontinued operations 
this discussion and analysis will focus primarily on our ophthalmology business because this is our continuing business and therefore provides more relevant information to the reader of our financial statements both on a retrospective and prospective basis

towards the end of  we introduced the txcell scanning laser delivery system which saves significant time in a variety of laser photocoagulation procedures in allowing physicians to deliver the laser in a multi spot scanning mode  a more efficient method for these procedures than the traditional single spot mode 
our current family of laser probes includes a wide variety of products in  and gauge for vitreoretinal surgery and glaucoma surgery

table of contents the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  our effective tax rate increased due mainly to the change from pretax income of million to pretax loss of million 
as a result of the current year loss  the tax rate had also increased by a larger reduction in valuation allowance in the current year and the anticipated refund claim from carrying back tax loss to and for federal income tax purposes 
comparison of and revenues 
total revenues from continuing operations for were million compared with million in  an increase of million or 
our ophthalmology system revenues grew as a result of a resurgence in appreciation of the benefits of laser photocoagulation as a treatment modality amongst physicians and a recovery in capital spending particularly in the us competition for consumable products remains strong with increased price sensitivities amongst customers

in november  the company entered into a license and distribution agreement with alcon for the iridex greentip softtip cannula family of products 
as part of the agreement alcon agreed to pay 
table of contents million at signing as a settlement of past legal claims 
the company has treated this as part of its ongoing business and therefore as part of operating income because the agreement has established on ongoing commercial relationship that will benefit the company s continuing business in subsequent periods 
other income expense 
income from the settlement with synergetics of legal claims related to patent infringement amounted to million for both periods 
during  the remeasurement on the fair value of the earn out liability from prior acquisitions resulted in expense of million 
income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes on continuing operations of million and an effective tax rate of for fiscal year similar to a provision for income taxes of million and an effective tax rate of for fiscal year our tax rate is benefiting from a reduction in the valuation allowance we currently have booked against our deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources comparison of and liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing or to raise capital 
during  net cash used in continuing operating activities was million

this compares to net cash provided by continuing operating activities in of million which was generated from net income from continuing operations of million with non cash items of million less changes in working capital of million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  no debt outstanding and working capital of million compared with cash and cash equivalents of million  no debt and working capital of million as of december  management is of the opinion that the company s current cash and cash equivalents together with our ability to generate cash flows from operations provide sufficient liquidity to operate for the next months

table of contents contractual payment obligations our contractual payment obligations that were fixed and determinable as of december  were as follows in thousands payments due by period total year years years operating leases payments total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations are presented and accounted for in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc 
when a qualifying component of the company is disposed of or has been classified as held for sale  the operating results of that component are removed from continuing operations for all periods presented and displayed as discontinued operations if a elimination of the component s operations and cash flows from the company s ongoing operations has occurred or will occur and b significant continuing involvement by the company in the component s operations does not exist after the disposal transaction 
on december   we entered into an agreement to sell our aesthetics business to cutera  inc the sale of the aesthetics business was completed on february  the operating results of our aesthetics business were therefore classified as discontinued operations  and the associated assets and liabilities were classified as discontinued for all periods presented under the requirements of asc revenue recognition 
our revenues arise from the sale of laser consoles  delivery devices  consumables and service and support activities 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and product shipment provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured 
shipments are generally made with free on board fob shipping point terms  whereby title passes upon shipment from our dock 
any shipments with fob receiving point terms are recorded as revenue when the shipment arrives at the receiving point 
cost is recognized as product sales revenue is recognized 
the company s sales may include post sales obligations for training or other deliverables 
for revenue arrangements such as these  we recognize revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  multiple element arrangements 
the company allocates revenue among deliverables in multiple element arrangements using the relative selling price method 
revenue allocated to each element is recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria is met for each element 
the company is required to apply a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
in general  the company is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for all of the elements in the arrangement  therefore  revenue is allocated to 
table of contents these elements based on the company s esp  which the company determines after considering multiple factors such as management approved pricing guidelines  geographic differences  market conditions  competitor pricing strategies  internal costs and gross margin objectives 
these factors may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
as a result  the company s esp for products and services could change 
revenues for post sales obligations are recognized as the obligations are fulfilled 
in international regions  we utilize distributors to market and sell our products 
we recognize revenue upon shipment for sales to these independent  third party distributors as we have no continuing obligations subsequent to shipment 
generally our distributors are responsible for all marketing  sales  installation  training and warranty labor coverage for our products 
our standard terms and conditions do not provide price protection or stock retention rights to any of our distributors 
royalty revenues are typically based on licensees net sales of products that utilize our technology and are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured  such as upon the earlier of the receipt of a royalty statement from the licensee or upon payment by the licensee 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include on hand inventory physically held at the company s facility  sales demo inventory and service loaner inventory 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out fifo method 
lower of cost or market is evaluated by considering obsolescence  excessive levels of inventory  deterioration and other factors 
adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  are made for estimated excess  obsolete or impaired inventory and are charged to cost of revenues 
factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration and quality issues 
revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates 
sales returns allowance and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns allowance in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our provision for sales returns is recorded net of the associated costs 
the balance for the provision of sales returns have not historically been material 
similarly management must make estimates regarding the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non payment by customers to the extent of amounts recorded on the balance sheet 
as sales levels increase the level of accounts receivable would likely also increase 
in addition  in the event that customers were to delay their payments to us  the levels of accounts receivable would likely also increase 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on past payment history with the customer  analysis of the customer s current financial condition  the aging of the accounts receivable balance  customer concentration and other known factors 
warranty 
the company accrues for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products 
actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued 
the company s warranty policy is applicable to products which are considered defective in their performance or fail to meet the product specifications 
warranty costs are reflected in the statements of operations as cost of revenues 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
under asc  the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate annually the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
in and  we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets based on our current year loss and the uncertainty regarding our ability to project future taxable income 
in future periods if we are able to generate income we may reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc asc seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax provision that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return 
additionally  asc provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
under asc  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
in accordance with our accounting policy  we recognize accrued interests and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
accounting for stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation asc which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s service period 
the company recognizes compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we determined that the black scholes option pricing model is the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock options 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
recently issued and adopted accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
it does not  however  change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective 
table of contents date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 in order to redeliberate the portion of the earlier asu relating to presentation of reclassifications from other comprehensive income 
the company adopted both updates  applied retrospectively  in the first quarter of as asu and asu are only presentation standards  the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in september  fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this standard is intended to simplify how entities  test goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september   if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or  for nonpublic entities  have not yet been made available for issuance 
the company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in february  fasb issued  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  which aims to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of aoci 
this update requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of aoci on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under gaap to be reclassified in its entirety to net income 
for other amounts that are not required under gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period  an entity is required to cross reference other disclosures required under gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendments do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements 
for public entities  the amendments are effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  we intend to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of we do not anticipate this update will have any significant impact on our consolidated financial position  operating results or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we transact the majority of our business in us dollars and therefore changes in foreign currency rates will not have a significant impact on our income statement or cash flows 
however  increases in the value of the us dollar against any local currencies could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country or region  leading to reduced revenue or profitability in that country or region 
as we continue to expand our international sales  our non us dollar denominated revenue and our exposure to gains and losses on international currency transactions may increase 
we currently do not engage in transactions to hedge against the risk of the currency fluctuation  but we may do so in the future
