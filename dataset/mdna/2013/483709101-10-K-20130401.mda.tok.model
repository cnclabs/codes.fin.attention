utility vehicles utvs experienced a significant decrease in revenue from  to  this decrease is due to a drop in unit sales from  units in to units in this significant decrease in sales is primarily attributable to high competition in the utv market  and the fact that the utvs manufactured by the company are relatively high end and more expensive than comparable products offered by our competitors  which caused our average unit price to manufacture a utv to increase significantly compared to the same period of last year

sales and distribution kandi s sales are made through the company s own sales force and trading companies  which distribute kandi s products to local and international customers 
sources of supply kandi manufactures the major components of its vehicles by itself 
other components and parts needed are purchased from expertise suppliers and specialized manufacturers 
kandi does not have and does not anticipate having any difficulty in obtaining its required materials from suppliers  in reaching this determination  we considered our current contracts and our current satisfactory business relationship with our suppliers 
competition the global off road vehicle market and new ev market are both highly competitive 
competition in such markets is based upon a number of factors  including price  quality  reliability  styling  product features and warranties 
with respect to the chinese domestic pure ev industry  many of our competitors have financial and marketing resources that are substantially greater than kandi  however  we believe we are one of the industry leaders 
employees as of december   kandi had a total of full time employees 
none of our employees are represented by any collective bargaining agreements 
environmental and safety regulation emissions the united states environmental protection agency epa and the california air resources board carb have adopted emissions regulations applicable to kandi s products 
carb has emissions regulations for atvs and off road vehicles which the company already meets 
in october  the epa established new corporate average emission standards effective for model years through for non road recreational vehicles  including atvs and off road vehicles 
kandi s motorcycles are also subject to epa and carb emission standards 
kandi believes that its motorcycles comply with these standards 
carb regulations  adopted by the epa in january  required additional motorcycle emission reductions in model year  which the company met 
kandi s products are also subject to international laws and regulations related to emissions in places where it sells its products outside the united states 
europe currently regulates emissions from certain of the company s atv based products  motorcycles  and super mini cars and the company meets these requirements 
canada s emission regulations for motorcycles are similar to those in the us in december  canada proposed a new regulation that would essentially adopt the us emission standards for atvs and off road vehicles 
these regulations became effective in and the company meets this standard 
kandi believes that its off road vehicles and super mini cars comply with applicable emission standards and related regulations in the united states and internationally 
kandi is unable to predict the ultimate impact of standards adopted in the future or proposed regulations on kandi and its business 
use regulation state and federal laws and regulations have been promulgated or are under consideration relating to the use or manner of use of kandi s products 
some states and localities have adopted  or are considering the adoption of  legislation and local ordinances which restrict the use of atvs and off road vehicles to specified hours and locations 
the federal government also has restricted the use of atvs and off road vehicles in some national parks and federal lands 
in several instances this restriction has been a ban on the recreational use of these vehicles 
kandi is unable to predict the outcome of such actions or the possible effect on its business 
kandi believes that its business would be no more adversely affected than those of its competitors by the adoption of any pending laws or regulations 
product safety and regulation safety regulation the federal government and individual states have promulgated or are considering promulgating laws and regulations relating to the use and safety of kandi s products 
the federal government is the primary regulator of product safety 
the consumer product safety commission cpsc has federal oversight over product safety issues related to atvs and off road vehicles 
the national highway transportation safety administration nhtsa has federal oversight over product safety issues related to on road motorcycles 
in august  the consumer product safety improvement act the act was passed 
the act includes a provision that requires all manufacturers and distributors who import into or distribute atvs within the united states to comply with the ansi svia safety standards  which were previously voluntary 
the act also requires the same manufacturers and distributors to have atv action plans filed with the cpsc that are substantially similar to the voluntary action plans that were previously in effect 
kandi currently complies with the ansi svia standard 
kandi s motorcycles are subject to federal vehicle safety standards administered by nhtsa 
kandi s motorcycles are also subject to various state vehicle safety standards 
kandi believes that its motorcycles comply with safety standards relevant to motorcycles 
kandi s products are also subject to international standards related to safety in places where it sells its products outside the united states 
kandi believes that its motorcycles and super mini cars comply with applicable safety standards in the united states and internationally

risk factors 
you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report before making an investment decision with regard to our securities 
the statements contained in or incorporated into this annual report on form k that are not historic facts are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks relating to our overall business operations we may not be able to comply with all applicable government regulations 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the central  regional and local authorities in the prc  where our business operations take place 
we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with all laws and governmental regulations and that we have all material permits and licenses required for our operations 
nevertheless  we cannot assure investors that we will continue to be in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations  or that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations 
to the extent that new regulations are adopted  we will be required to conform our activities in order to comply with such regulations 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations and finances 
compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive  and noncompliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages and fines 
our business operations generate noise  waste water  and gaseous and other industrial wastes 
we are required to comply with all national and local regulations regarding protection of the environment 
we are in compliance with current environmental protection requirements and have all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
however  if more stringent regulations are adopted in the future  the costs of compliance with these new regulations could be substantial 
additionally  if we fail to comply with present or future environmental regulations  we may be required to pay substantial fines  suspend production or cease operations 
any failure by us to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject us to potentially significant monetary damages and fines or suspensions to our business operations 
certain laws  ordinances and regulations could limit our ability to develop  use  or sell our products 
our business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our executive officers  and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services 
our future success depends substantially on the continued services of our executive officers  especially our ceo and chairman of the board of directors  mr 
hu xiaoming 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our executive officers 
although this possibility is low  if any of our executive officers are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  we may not be able to replace them readily  if at all 
therefore  our business may be severely disrupted  and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new officers 
in addition  if any of our executives joins a competitor or forms a competing company  we may lose some of our customers 
we may be subject to product liability claims  recalls or warranty claims  which could be expensive  damage our reputation and result in a diversion of management resources 
the company may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of the vehicles that it sells 
the company may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense of these claims 
there is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed our insurance coverage 
in addition  the company may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future 
the company may also be required to participate in recalls involving our vehicles  if any prove to be defective  or we may voluntarily initiate a recall or make payments related to such claims as a result of various industry or business practices or the need to maintain good customer relationships 
such a recall would result in a diversion of resources 
while we do maintain product liability insurance  we cannot assure you that it will be sufficient to cover all product liability claims  that such claims will not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as disclosed in a number of areas  including item of this form k  there are two lawsuits currently pending in state court in ripley county  missouri against the company and its subsidiary  kandi vehicles  as well as other third parties  in connection with the death of two individuals who died on march   while operating a go cart that was allegedly manufactured by kandi vehicles 
the company intends to defend these cases vigorously and expects to prevail in this lawsuit since neither the company nor its subsidiaries manufactured the subject vehicle in the accident  however  if the company does not prevail  or resolve this lawsuit favorably  these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
general economic conditions may negatively impact our results 
the consumption of entertainment products  such as go karts  and super mini cars depends on continued economic growth 
due to the european debt crisis and the slow global economy  the uncertainty of the current economic environment remains 
moderate or severe economic downturns or adverse conditions may negatively affect our operations 
these conditions may be widespread or isolated to one or more geographic regions 
a tightening of the labor markets in one or more geographic regions may result in fewer qualified applicants for job openings in our facilities 
higher wages  related labor costs and other increasing cost trends may negatively impact our results 
government policies may negatively affect our result the company s ev products currently are mainly sold to chinese domestic market  and ev industry is supported by the chinese central and local governments 
therefore  our ev products performance is significantly affected by the policies adopted by chinese central and local governments 
any significant adverse changes in the chinese governments supporting policies may negatively affect our results 
the audit report included in this annual report was prepared by auditors who are not inspected by the public company accounting oversight board and  as a result  you are deprived of the benefits of such inspection the independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit reports included in our annual reports filed with the sec  as auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the united states and a firm registered with the public company accounting oversight board united states  or the pcaob  is required by the laws of the united states to undergo regular inspections by the pcaob to assess its compliance with the laws of the united states and professional standards 
because our auditors are located in hong kong  a jurisdiction where the pcaob is currently unable to conduct inspections  our auditors are not currently inspected by the pcaob 
inspections of other firms that the pcaob has conducted outside the us have identified deficiencies in those firms audit procedures and quality control procedures  which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality 
this lack of pcaob inspections in china and hong kong prevents the pcaob from regularly evaluating our auditor audits and its quality control procedures 
as a result  investors may be deprived of the benefits of pcaob inspections 
the inability of the pcaob to conduct inspections of auditors in china makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of china that are subject to pcaob inspections 
investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements 
risks relating to our vehicle machinery production operations we may be subject to significant potential liabilities as a result of defects in production and product liability 
through our machinery production operations  we may be subject to claims of product defects and or product liability arising in the ordinary course of business 
these claims are common to the machinery production industry and can be costly 
with respect to certain general liability exposures  including manufacturing defect and product liability  interpretation of underlying current and future trends  assessment of claims and the related liability and reserve estimation process is highly subjective due to the complex nature of these exposures  with each exposure exhibiting unique circumstances 
furthermore  once claims are asserted for construction defects  it is difficult to determine the extent to which the assertion of these claims will expand geographically 
we may not have sufficient funds available to cover any liability for damages  the cost of repairs  and or the expense of litigation surrounding such claims  and future claims may arise out of events or circumstances not covered by insurance and not subject to effective indemnification agreements with our subcontractors 
the vehicle machinery industry is highly competitive  and we are subject to risks relating to competition that may adversely affect our performance 
the vehicle machinery industry is highly competitive  and our continued success depends upon our ability to compete effectively in markets that contain numerous competitors  some of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we have 
competition may reduce our pricing structures  potentially causing us to lower our prices  which may adversely impact our profits 
new or existing competition that uses a business model that is different from our business model may put pressure on us to change our model so that we can remain competitive 
our high concentration of sales to relatively few customers may result in significant uncollectible accounts receivable exposure  which may adversely impact our liquidity  business  results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   our top five customers  in the aggregate  accounted for and  respectively  of our sales and accounts receivable 
due to the concentration of sales to relatively few customers  we face credit exposure from our customers and may experience uncollectible receivables from these customers should they face financial difficulties 
if these customers fail to pay their accounts receivable  file for bankruptcy or significantly reduce their purchases of our programming  it would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
the company s major customers for the year ended december  accounted for the following percentages of total sales and accounts receivable as follows sales accounts receivable twelve twelve months months ended ended major customers december  december  december  december  company a company b company c company d company e our business is subject to the risk of supplier concentrations 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for the sourcing of major components and parts and principal raw materials 
as of december  and  one supplier accounted for and of our purchases  respectively 
as a result of this concentration in our supply chain  our business and operations would be negatively affected if any of our key suppliers were to experience significant disruption affecting the price  quality  availability or timely delivery of their products 
the partial or complete loss of these suppliers  or a significant adverse change in our relationship with any of these suppliers  could result in lost revenue  added costs and distribution delays that could harm our business and customer relationships 
in addition  concentration in our supply chain can exacerbate our exposure to risks associated with the termination by key suppliers of our distribution agreements or any adverse change in the terms of such agreements  which could have a negative impact on our revenues and profitability 
the company s major suppliers for the twelve months ended december  accounted for the following percentage of total purchases and accounts payable as follows purchases accounts payable twelve twelve months months ended ended major suppliers december  december  december  december  company f company g company h company i company j risks related to doing business in china changes in political and economic conditions may affect our business operations and profitability 
since our business operations are primarily located in china  our business operations and financial position are subject  to a significant degree  to the economic  political and legal developments in china 
while the chinese government has not halted its economic reform policy since  any significant adverse changes in the social  political and economic conditions of china may fundamentally impact china s economic reform policies  and thus the company s operations and profits may be adversely affected 
change in tax laws and regulations in china may affect our business operations 
various tax reform policies have been implemented in the prc in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that the existing tax laws and regulations will not be revised or amended in the future 
uncertainties with respect to the chinese legal system could have a material adverse effect on us and may restrict the level of legal protections to foreign investors 
china s legal system is based on statutory law 
unlike the common law system  statutory law is based primarily on written statutes 
previous court decisions may be cited as persuasive authority but do not have a binding effect 
since  the prc government has been promulgating and amending the laws and regulations regarding economic matters  such as corporate organization and governance  foreign investment  commerce  taxation and trade 
however  since these laws and regulations are relatively new  and the prc legal system continues to rapidly evolve  the interpretation of many laws  regulations and rules is not always uniform and enforcement of these laws  regulations and rules involves uncertainties  which may limit legal protections available to us 
in addition  any litigation in china may be protracted and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management s attention 
the legal system in china cannot provide investors with the same level of protection as in the us the company is governed by the law and regulations generally applicable to local enterprises in china 
many of these laws and regulations were recently introduced and remain experimental in nature and subject to changes and refinements 
interpretation  implementation and enforcement of the existing laws and regulations can be uncertain and unpredictable and therefore may restrict the legal protections of foreign investors 
changes in currency conversion policies in china may have a material adverse effect on us 
renminbi rmb is still not a freely exchangeable currency 
since  the state administration of foreign exchange of china has promulgated a series of circulars and rules in order to enhance verification of foreign exchange payments under a chinese entity s current account items  and has imposed strict requirements on borrowing and repayments of foreign exchange debts from and to foreign creditors under the capital account items and on the creation of foreign security in favor of foreign creditors 
this may complicate foreign exchange payments to foreign creditors under the current account items and thus will affect the ability to borrow under international commercial loans  the creation of foreign security  and the borrowing of rmb under guarantees in foreign currencies 
furthermore  the value of rmb may become subject to supply and demand  which could be largely impacted by international economic and political environments 
any fluctuations in the exchange rate of rmb could have an adverse effect on the operational and financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries in china 
you may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process  enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions based on united states or other foreign laws against us  our management or the experts named in the prospectus 
we conduct substantially all of our operations in china and substantially all of our assets are located in china 
in addition  almost all of our senior executive officers reside in china 
as a result  it may not be possible to effect service of process within the united states or elsewhere outside china upon our senior executive officers  including with respect to matters arising under us federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws 
moreover  our prc counsel has advised us that the prc does not have treaties with the united states or many other countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment of courts 
risks relating to ownership of our securities our stock price may be volatile  which may result in losses to our shareholders 
the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations  and the market prices of companies listed on the nasdaq capital market and nasdaq global market have been volatile in the past and have experienced sharp share price and trading volume changes 
although our stock is listed on the nasdaq global market  the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to many factors  including the following  some of which are beyond our control variations in our operating results  changes in expectations of our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors  changes in operating and stock price performance of other companies in our industry  additions or departures of key personnel  and future sales of our common stock 
domestic and international stock markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic and political conditions unrelated to our performance  may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
mr 
hu  our ceo  president and chairman of our board of directors is the beneficial owner of a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock  which may enable mr 
hu to exert significant influence on corporate actions 
excelvantage group limited controls approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of december  on march   hu xiaoming  the company s chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board of directors  became the sole stockholder of excelvantage group limited 
excelvantage group limited has a substantial impact on matters requiring the vote of the shareholders  including the election of our directors and most corporate actions 
this control could delay  defer or prevent others from initiating a potential merger  takeover or other change in our control  even if these actions would benefit our other shareholders and the company 
this control could adversely affect the voting and other rights of our other shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock 
our common shares may become thinly traded and you may be unable to sell your shares readily we cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for trading our common stock will be sustained 
although our trading volume has increased gradually in recent years  our stock has historically been sporadic or thinly traded  meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at any given time may be relatively small 
this situation is attributable to a number of factors  including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts  stock brokers  institutional investors and others in the investment community who generate or influence sales volume 
even if we came to the attention of such persons  those persons tend to be risk averse and may be reluctant to follow  purchase  or recommend the purchase of shares of an unproven company such as ours until such time as we become more seasoned and viable 
as a consequence  there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal  as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price 
we cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained  or that current trading levels will be sustained 
the market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively small company  which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price 
you may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price if at all  which may result in substantial losses to you 
substantial exercise of warrants could adversely affect our stock price or our ability to raise additional financing in the public capital markets 
as of december   there were  shares of warrants outstanding 
if the warrant holders exercise the warrants and sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the future  or if investors perceive that these sales may occur  the market price of our common stock could decline or market demand for our common stock could be sharply reduced 
the exercise of warrants and subsequent sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could also adversely affect demand for  and the market price of  our common stock 
each of these transactions could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing by issuing equity or equity based securities in the public capital markets 
as of the filing date of this form k  the number warrant shares outstanding as of december   has been reduced  as a result of expiration or exercises to we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to our common shareholders 
we presently do not anticipate that we will pay dividends on any of our common stock in the foreseeable future 
if payment of dividends does occur at some point in the future  it would be contingent upon our revenues and earnings  if any  capital requirements  and general financial condition 
the payment of any common stock dividends will be within the discretion of our board of directors 
we presently intend to retain all earnings after paying the interest for the preferred stock  if any  to implement our business plan  accordingly  we do not anticipate the declaration of any dividends for common stock in the foreseeable future 
fluctuation in the value of the rmb may have a material adverse effect on your investment 
the change in value of the rmb against the us dollar  the euro and other currencies is affected by changes in china s political and economic conditions  among other things 
on july   the prc government changed its decade old policy of pegging the value of the rmb to the us dollar 
under the new policy  the rmb is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies 
while the international reaction to the rmb revaluation has generally been positive  there remains significant international pressure on the prc government to adopt an even more flexible currency policy  which could result in a further and more significant appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar 
as a portion of our costs and expenses is denominated in rmb  the revaluation in july and potential future revaluation has and could further increase our costs 
in addition  any significant revaluation of the rmb may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
for example  to the extent that we need to convert us dollars we receive from financings into rmb for our operations  appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar would have an adverse effect on the rmb amount we receive from the conversion 
conversely  if we decide to convert our rmb into us dollars for the purpose of making payments for business purposes  appreciation of the us dollar against the rmb would have a negative effect on the us dollar amount available to us 
we may be unable to maintain compliance with nasdaq marketplace rules which could cause our common stock to be delisted from the nasdaq global market 
this could result in the lack of a market for our common stock  cause a decrease in the value of our common stock  and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under the nasdaq marketplace rules our common stock must maintain a minimum price of per share for continued inclusion on the nasdaq global market 
we cannot guarantee that our stock price will remain at or above per share and if the price again drops below per share  the stock could become subject to delisting 
if our common stock is delisted  trading of the stock will most likely take place on an over the counter market established for unlisted securities 
an investor is likely to find it less convenient to sell  or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy  our common stock on an over the counter market  and many investors may not buy or sell our common stock due to difficulty in accessing over the counter markets  or due to policies preventing them from trading in securities not listed on a national exchange or other reasons 
for these reasons and others  delisting would adversely affect the liquidity  trading volume and price of our common stock  causing the value of an investment in us to decrease and having an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations by limiting our ability to attract and retain qualified executives and employees and limiting our ability to raise capital 
volatility in our common share price may subject us to securities litigation 
the market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility as compared to seasoned issuers  and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future 
in the past  plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may  in the future  be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management s attention and resources 
the elimination of monetary liability against our directors  officers and employees under delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights of our directors  officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by our company and may discourage lawsuits against our directors  officers and employees 
our articles of incorporation do not contain any specific provisions that eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to our company and shareholders  however  we are prepared to give such indemnification to our directors and officers to the extent provided for by delaware law 
we may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment agreements with our officers 
the foregoing indemnification obligations could result in our company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers  which we may be unable to recoup 
these provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties  and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our shareholders against our directors and officers even though such actions  if successful  might otherwise benefit our company and shareholders 
we may need additional capital  and the sale of additional shares or other equity securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
in the future  we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our business is subject to changing regulations related to corporate governance and public disclosure that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec and nasdaq  have issued requirements and regulations and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with these regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue resulting in  increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
because new and modified laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices

all land in the prc is owned by the government and its ownership cannot be sold or transferred by or to any individual or private entity 
instead  the government grants or allocates landholders a land use right 
there are four methods to acquire land use rights grant of the right to use land  assignment of the right to use land  lease of the right to use land  and allocated land use rights in comparison with western common law concepts  granted land use rights are similar to life estates and allocated land use rights are in some ways similar to leaseholds 
granted land use rights are provided by the government in exchange for a grant fee  and carry the rights to pledge  mortgage  lease  and transfer within the term of the grant 
land is granted for a fixed term generally years for residential use  years for industrial use  and years for commercial and other use 
the term is renewable in theory 
unlike the usual case in western nations  granted land must be used for the specific purpose for which it was granted 
allocated land use rights are generally provided by the government for an indefinite period usually to state owned entities and cannot be pledged  mortgaged  leased  or transferred by the user 
furthermore  allocated land can be reclaimed by the government at any time 
allocated land use rights may be converted into granted land use rights upon the payment of a grant fee to the government

there are two lawsuits currently pending in state court in ripley county  missouri against the company and its subsidiary  kandi vehicles as well as other third parties  kandi investment group and sunl group  in connection with the death of two individuals who died on march   while operating a go cart that was allegedly manufactured by kandi vehicles 
kandi investment group was a major shareholder of kandi vehicles but it transferred all its equity in kandi vehicles to continental development limited in november since then  kandi investment group has been unrelated to the company or its affiliates 
the cases were filed in and are identified as elder vs 
sunl group and griffen vs 
sunl group 
in march  the local trial court entered two default judgments  each in the amount of  against our subsidiary  kandi vehicles as well as other parties including kandi investment 
a default judgment was not entered against the company 
the lawsuit and default judgments were not brought to the company or kandi vehicles attention until may or june  the company was not served with the complaint or notified of the lawsuits and only learned of their existence and of the default judgments in the course of commercial discussions with another of the defendants in the cases 
the company and kandi vehicles have filed answers to the complaint denying any culpability 
in addition  the company requested that the court set aside the default judgments against kandi vehicles  a request granted  by the court  on february  on march   the plaintiffs subsequently appealed the court order vacating the default judgments  however  the plaintiffs have since voluntarily withdrawn their appeal 
the company intends to defend these cases vigorously and expects to prevail in this lawsuit since the company including its subsidiaries did not manufacture the subject vehicle in the accident 
this case is set for trial in july at the present time  we believe that resolving the above matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  our results of operations  or our cash flows  however  these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
readers should carefully review the risk factors disclosed in this form k and other documents filed by the company with the sec 
critical accounting policies and estimates this section should be read together with the summary of significant accounting policies in the attached consolidated financial statements included in this report 
estimates affecting accounts receivable and inventories the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reporting of assets and liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates are particularly significant where they affect the reported net realizable value of the company s accounts receivable and inventories 
accounts receivable are recognized and carried at net realizable value 
an allowance for doubtful accounts will be recorded in the period when a loss is probable based on an assessment of specific evidence indicating troubled collection  historical experience  accounts aging  ongoing business relation and other factors 
accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection 
if accounts receivable are to be provided for  or written off  they would be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations within operating expenses 
at december  and  the company has an allowance for doubtful accounts of and respectively  as per the management s judgment based on their best knowledge 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost  determined on a weighted average basis  or net realizable value 
net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated cost of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale 
when inventories are sold  their carrying amount is charged to expense in the year in which the revenue is recognized 
write downs for declines in net realizable value or for losses of inventories are recognized as an expense in the year the impairment or loss occurs 
there was a  decline in net realizable value of inventory for the year ended of december  due to our reserve for slow moving inventory 
while the company currently believes that there is little likelihood that actual results will differ materially from these current estimates  if customer demand for our products decreases significantly in the near future  or if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates in the near future  the company could realize significant write downs for slow moving inventories or uncollectible accounts receivable 
policy affecting recognition of revenue among the most important accounting policies affecting our consolidated financial statements is our policy of recognizing revenue 
revenues represent the invoiced value of goods sold  recognized upon the shipment of goods to customers  and are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
policy affecting options  warrants and convertible notes the company s stock option cost is recorded in accordance with asc and asc the fair value of stock options is estimated using the black scholes merton model 
the company s expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected life assumption is primarily based on the expiration date of the option 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
stock option expense recognized is based on awards expected to vest 
there were no estimated forfeitures 
asc standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods  if necessary  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the company s warrant costs are recorded in liabilities and equities  respectively  in accordance with asc  asc and asc the company estimates the fair value of warrants that are classified as a liability using a black scholes merton model 
the company s expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected life assumption is primarily based on the expiration date of the warrant 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the warrant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement 
warrants that are freestanding derivatives and classified as liabilities on the balance sheet are measured at fair value on each reporting date  with decreases in fair value recognized in earnings and increases in fair values recognized in expenses 
for those warrants that are not considered derivatives under asc  the company estimates that the fair value of equity based warrants using the black scholes merton model 
the company s expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected life assumption is primarily based on the expiration date of the warrant 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
in accordance with asc  the conversion feature of the convertible notes is separated from the debt instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative instrument 
on the date the convertible notes are issued  the conversion feature was recorded as a liability at its fair value  and future decreases in fair value are recognized in earnings while increases in fair values are recognized in expenses 
the company used the black scholes merton option pricing model to obtain the fair value of the conversion feature 
the company s expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected life assumption is primarily based on the expiration date of the conversion features 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the conversion features is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of measurement

this increase is primarily due to our increased sales and gross profit 
summary of th quarter results for the three months ended december   our revenue increased by from  to  the cost of goods sold also increased during the same period  while gross profit increased  or  from  in the corresponding period last year to  in the fourth quarter of for the three months ended december   the general and administrative expenses increased to  mainly because of the impairments of some asset value  and the increase of depreciation and amortization expense

this decrease is primarily due to the increased general and administrative expense 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow net cash used by operating activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  the difference is mainly because  for the year ended december   the change in accounts receivable caused a net cash outflow of  compared to a net cash inflow of  for the same reporting period in net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  as compared to net cash flow used in investing activities of  for the same reporting period in this was primarily due to  net cash outflow for deposit for asset purchase  and a net cash inflow of  in note receivable  as compared to a net cash outflow in notes receivable of  for the same period last year 
net cash flow provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to net cash flow provided by financing activities of  for the same period of this change is primarily attributable to a net cash inflow of  in note payable  as compared to a net cash outflow in notes payable of  for the same period last year  the company issued  shares of common stock for acquisition in and more option and warrants exercised in compared to the fiscal year of  and the cash inflow  in bond payable in year  although the company recorded a net cash outflow in short term bank loans and restricted cash in year compared to a net cash inflow in these two areas in year working capital the company had a working capital surplus of  as of december   increase from a working capital surplus of  as of december  as of december   the company had credit lines from commercial banks for  of which  had been used as of december  the company believes that its cash flows generated internally may not be sufficient to support growth of future operations and repay short term bank loans for the next twelve months  if needed 
however  the company believes its access to existing financing sources and established relationships with prc banks will enable it to meet its obligations and fund its ongoing operations 
the company has historically financed itself through short term commercial bank loans from prc banks 
the term of these loans is typically for one year  and upon the payment of all outstanding principal and interest in a respective loan  the banks have typically rolled over the loans for additional one year terms  with adjustments made to the interest rate to reflect prevailing market rates 
the company believes this situation has not changed and the short term bank loans will be available on normal trade terms if needed
