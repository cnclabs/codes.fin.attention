government regulation the company is directly affected by government regulation and reimbursement policies in virtually every country in which it operates 
government regulations and health care policy differ from country to country  and within some countries most notably the us  european union  australia and canada  from state to state or province to province 
changes in regulations and health care policy take place frequently and can impact the size  growth potential and profitability of products sold in each market 
in the us  the growth of health care costs has increased at rates in excess of the rate of inflation and as a percentage of gdp for several decades 
a number of efforts to control the federal deficit have impacted reimbursement levels for government sponsored health care programs and private insurance companies often imitate changes made in federal programs 
reimbursement guidelines in the home health care industry have a substantial impact on the nature and type of equipment an end user can obtain and thus  affect the product mix  pricing and payment patterns of the company s customers who are the hme providers 
the company continues its proactive efforts to try to influence public policy that impacts home and community based  non acute health care 
the company is currently very active with federal legislation and regulatory policy makers 
invacare believes that these efforts give the company a competitive advantage in two ways

the three audit reports include first  the third party expert will inspect the qualification and validation procedures and documentation for equipment and processes at the taylor street manufacturing facility 
once the fda has reviewed the report and notified the company that those procedures appear to be in compliance  which may or may not require an fda inspection  the company will be permitted to resume the manufacturing of components and parts in its taylor street facility for the further manufacture of devices produced by other invacare facilities

once the fda has reviewed the report and notified the company that the design control systems appear to be in compliance  which may or may not require an fda inspection  the company will be able to resume design activities of wheelchairs and power beds at the impacted elyria facilities 
the final inspection by the third party expert will be a comprehensive review of the company compliance with the fda quality system regulations at the impacted elyria facilities 
this audit will be followed by an fda inspection 
after receipt of a written notification from the fda that the company appears to be in compliance  the company may resume full operations at the corporate and taylor street manufacturing facilities

the affordable care act imposes a productivity adjustment to the annual fee schedules of i 
table of contents all medicare providers  including hme providers  that limits any annual cost of living increases applied to the fee schedules 
the affordable care act also includes a new tax on us sales of medical device manufacturers or importers  such as invacare 
the yearly sales based excise tax on medical device manufacturers went into effect on january  the excise tax will not apply to medical devices that the secretary of treasury determines are generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use 
in december  the internal revenue service issued final regulations on the excise tax on medical devices as part of the affordable care act 
the excise tax will be deductible by the manufacturer on its federal income tax return 
the company has reviewed the final regulations and believes that most of its products will be exempt from the tax based on the retail exemption provided in the regulations 
the company does believe that certain products that it sells for institutional use will be subject to the excise tax 
based on its interpretation of the regulations  the company expects the impact from the tax will be less than million on an annual basis 
the company intends to pass this tax on to the market 
with respect to reimbursement in the united states  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms began implementation january  in the first nine metropolitan areas of the medicare national competitive bidding ncb program

the company remains judicious in its extension of credit to customers and monitors whether other payors begin to model their payments on the ncb program 
the company also closely watches state medicaid budgets and how deficits may impact coverage and payments for home medical equipment and institutional care products 
although reductions in medicare payments are not beneficial to the homecare industry  the company believes that  over the long term  it can still grow and thrive in this environment 
no significant cost of living adjustments have been made over the last few years to the reimbursement and payment amounts permitted under medicare with respect to the company s products  but the company will continue to try to respond with improved productivity 
in addition  the company s respiratory therapy products for example  the low cost homefill oxygen delivery system can help offset the medicare reimbursement cuts to the homecare provider 
the company will continue to focus on developing products that help the provider improve profitability 
additionally  the company continues to focus on low cost country sourcing and or manufacturing to help ensure that the company is one of the lowest cost manufacturers and distributors to the homecare provider 
backlog the company generally manufactures most of its products to meet near term demands by shipping from stock or by building to order based on the specialty nature of certain products

a delay in the timing of the completion of the third party expert certification audits  the fda inspection or clearance  or any need to complete significant additional remediation as a result of the third party expert certification audits or the fda inspection could have a material adverse effect on the company business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
during the pendency of the consent decree negotiations  and now during its effectiveness  the company has experienced pressures on its net sales and operating results from this segment 
while  at the time of this filing  the consent decree had been effective for only approximately two months and thus  the effect on customer orders and net sales was not yet clear  the company expects to experience further declines in net sales as a result of the limitations imposed by the consent decree 
see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company expects to continue to experience decreased net sales and challenged profitability in the north america hme segment until it has successfully completed the previously described third party expert certification audit and fda inspection and has received written notification from the fda that the company may resume full operations 
for example  the company expended an additional  in for regulatory and compliance costs to quality systems improvements compared to even after the company receives the fda notification  it is uncertain as to whether  or how quickly  the company will be able to rebuild net sales to more typical historical levels  irrespective of market conditions 
accordingly  the company expects that these challenges could negatively impact the company operating results in to an even greater degree than was experienced in the company s failure to comply with medical device regulatory requirements or receive regulatory clearance or approval for the company s products or operations in the united states or abroad could adversely affect the company s business 
the company s medical devices are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda  and by similar governmental authorities in the foreign countries where the company does business 
the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device s development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  promotion  distribution and marketing 
in addition  the company is required to file reports with the fda if the company s products cause  or contribute to  death or serious injury  or if they malfunction and would be likely to cause  or contribute to  death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
in general  unless an exemption applies  the company s mobility and respiratory therapy medical devices must receive a pre marketing clearance from the fda before they can be marketed in the united states 
the fda also regulates the export of medical devices to foreign countries 
the company cannot be assured that any of the company s devices  to the extent required  will be cleared by the fda through the pre market clearance process or that the fda will provide export certificates that are necessary to export certain of the company s products 
in connection with the fda warning letter received by the company sanford  florida facility in december  as described below  the fda has refused to provide new export certificates for company products until the i 
table of contents matters covered in the warning letter are resolved 
currently  the company cannot obtain new certificates of export for sanford  florida facility products until the warning letter has been closed and for taylor street facility products until the company has exited the injunctive phase of the consent decree 
additionally  the company is required to obtain pre marketing clearances to market modifications to the company s existing products or market its existing products for new indications 
the fda requires device manufacturers themselves to make and document a determination as to whether or not a modification requires a new clearance  however  the fda can review and disagree with a manufacturer s decision 
the company has applied for  and received  a number of such clearances in the past 
the company may not be successful in receiving clearances in the future or the fda may not agree with the company s decisions not to seek clearances for any particular device modification 
the fda may require a clearance for any past or future modification or a new indication for the company s existing products 
such submissions may require the submission of additional data and may be time consuming and costly  and ultimately may not be cleared by the fda 
if the fda requires the company to obtain pre marketing clearances for any modification to a previously cleared device  the company may be required to cease manufacturing and marketing the modified device or to recall the modified device until the company obtains fda clearance and the company may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
in addition  the fda may not clear these submissions in a timely manner  if at all 
the fda also may change its policies  adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations  each of which could prevent or delay pre market clearance of the company s devices  or could impact the company s ability to market a device that was previously cleared 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect the company s business 
the company s failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda and other applicable us regulatory requirements may subject the company to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions 
these sanctions include warning letters  civil penalties  criminal penalties  injunctions  consent decrees  product seizure or detention  product recalls and total or partial suspension of production 
as part of its regulatory function  the fda routinely inspects the sites of medical device companies  and in and  the fda inspected certain of the company facilities 
in december  the company and the fda agreed to a consent decree of injunction affecting the company corporate facility and its taylor street manufacturing facility in elyria  ohio 
see the previous risk factor regarding the fda consent decree 
in addition  in december  the company received a warning letter from the fda related to quality system processes and procedures at the company sanford  florida facility 
the company is taking the issues related to the warning letter very seriously and has added resources to ensure it is addressing all of the fda concerns in a timely manner 
however  the results of regulatory claims  proceedings  investigations  or litigation are difficult to predict 
an unfavorable resolution or outcome of the fda warning letter  or any other matter that may arise out of any routine fda inspection of the company sites  could materially and adversely affect the company business  financial condition and results of operations 
in many of the foreign countries in which the company markets its products  the company is subject to extensive medical device regulations that are similar to those of the fda  including those in europe 
the regulation of the company s products in europe falls primarily within the european economic area  which consists of the member states of the european union  as well as iceland  liechtenstein and norway 
only medical devices that comply with certain conformity requirements of the medical device directive are allowed to be marketed within the european economic area 
in addition  the national health or social security organizations of certain foreign countries  including those outside europe  require the company s products to be qualified before they can be marketed in those countries 
failure to receive or delays in the receipt of  relevant foreign qualifications in the european economic area or other foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
being in the health care industry  the company is subject to extensive government regulation  and if the company fails to comply with applicable health care laws or regulations  the company could suffer severe civil or criminal sanctions or be required to make significant changes to the company s operations that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company sells its products principally to medical equipment and home health care providers who resell or rent those products to consumers 
many of those providers the company s customers are reimbursed for the invacare products sold to their customers and patients by third party payors  including medicare and medicaid 
the us federal government and the governments in the states and other countries in which the company operates regulate many aspects of the company s business 
as a part of the health care industry  the company is subject to extensive government regulation  including numerous laws directed at preventing fraud and abuse and laws regulating reimbursement under various government programs 
the marketing  invoicing  documenting and other practices of health care suppliers and manufacturers are all subject to government scrutiny 
government agencies periodically open investigations and obtain information from health care suppliers and manufacturers pursuant to the legal process 
violations of law or regulations can result in severe administrative  civil and criminal penalties and sanctions  including i 
table of contents disqualification from medicare and other reimbursement programs  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
while the company has established numerous policies and procedures to address compliance with these laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that the company efforts will be effective to prevent a material adverse effect on the company s business from noncompliance issues 
for example  as discussed in the preceding risk factors  the company is subject to a fda consent decree affecting its corporate facility and taylor street manufacturing facility in elyria  ohio and received a fda warning letter related to its sandford  florida facility 
the company received a subpoena in from the us department of justice doj seeking documents relating to three long standing and well known promotional and rebate programs maintained by the company 
the company believes that the programs described in the subpoena are in compliance with all applicable laws and the company has cooperated fully with the government investigation 
as of february  the subpoena remains pending  although the last communication with the doj was in health care is an area of rapid regulatory change 
changes in the law and new interpretations of existing laws may affect permissible activities  the costs associated with doing business  and reimbursement amounts paid by federal  state and other third party payors 
the company cannot predict the future of federal  state and local regulation or legislation  including medicare and medicaid statutes and regulations  or possible changes in health care policies in any country in which the company conducts business 
future legislation and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
changes in government and other third party payor reimbursement levels and practices have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the company s revenues and profitability 
the company s products are sold primarily through a network of medical equipment and home health care providers  extended care facilities  hospital and hmo based stores and other providers 
in addition  the company sells directly to various government providers throughout the world 
many of these providers the company s customers are reimbursed for the products and services provided to their customers and patients by third party payors  such as government programs  including medicare and medicaid  private insurance plans and managed care programs 
most of these programs set maximum reimbursement levels for some of the products sold by the company in the united states and abroad 
if third party payors deny coverage  make the reimbursement process or documentation requirements more uncertain or further reduce their current levels of reimbursement ie  beyond the reductions described below  or if the company s costs of production do not decrease to keep pace with decreases in reimbursement levels  the company may be unable to sell the affected product s through its distribution channels on a profitable basis 
reduced government reimbursement levels and changes in reimbursement policies have in the past added  and could continue to add  significant pressure to the company s revenues and profitability 
for example  cms introduced ncb for nine metropolitan areas in the us  which went into effect in january the reimbursement rates for nine product categories were reduced by an average of percent in these nine metropolitan areas 
in january  cms announced new  lower medicare prices which will become effective in july for the second round of the ncb program  which was expanded to include an additional metropolitan areas 
the cms office of the actuary estimates that this program will save medicare billion and beneficiaries billion between and and that medicare beneficiaries in the metropolitan areas will save an average of percent for certain dme products scheduled to begin on july  similar trends and concerns are occurring in state medicaid programs 
these recent changes to reimbursement policies  and any additional unfavorable reimbursement policies or budgetary cuts that may be adopted in the future  could adversely affect the demand for the company s products by customers who depend on reimbursement from the government funded programs 
the percentage of the company s overall sales that are dependent on medicare or other insurance programs may increase as the portion of the us population over age continues to grow  making the company more vulnerable to reimbursement level reductions by these organizations 
reduced government reimbursement levels also could result in reduced private payor reimbursement levels because some third party payors index their reimbursement schedules to medicare fee schedules 
reductions in reimbursement levels also may affect the profitability of the company s customers and ultimately force some customers without strong financial resources to go out of business 
the reimbursement reductions may prove to be so dramatic that some of the company s customers may not be able to adapt quickly enough to survive 
the company is the industry s largest creditor and an increase in bankruptcies in the company s customer base could have an adverse effect on the company s financial results 
outside the united states  reimbursement systems vary significantly by country 
many foreign markets have government managed health care systems that govern reimbursement for new home health care products 
the ability of hospitals and other providers supported by such systems to purchase the company s products is dependent  in part  upon public budgetary constraints 
various countries have tightened reimbursement rates and other countries may follow 
if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors outside of the united states are not obtained  international sales of the company s products may decline  which could adversely affect the company s net sales 
i 
table of contents the impact of all the changes discussed above is uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the adoption of healthcare reform and other legislative developments in the united states may adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and or financial condition 
the affordable care act includes provisions that  among other things  reduce and or limit medicare reimbursement  require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and impose new and or increased taxes 
specifically  the law imposes a sales based excise tax on us sales by manufacturers of most medical devices that went into effect on january  the excise tax will not apply to medical devices that the secretary of treasury determines are generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use 
in january  the department of the treasury issued guidance on the definition of a taxable medical device related to the excise tax 
in december  the internal revenue service issued final regulations on the excise tax on medical devices as part of the affordable care act 
the excise tax will be deductible by the manufacturer on its federal income tax return 
the company has reviewed the final regulations and believes that most of its products will be exempt from the tax based on the retail exemption provided in the regulations  but that certain products that it sells for institutional use will be subject to the excise tax 
based on its interpretation of the regulations  the company expects the impact from the tax will be less than million on an annual basis 
while the company intends to pass this tax on to the market  the excise tax may increase the company s cost of doing business  particularly if the exemptions do not ultimately apply as the company expects based on its interpretations of the regulations 
various healthcare reform proposals also have emerged at the state level 
the new law and these proposals could impact the demand for the company s products or the prices at which the company sells its products 
the impact of this law and these proposals could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and or financial condition 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the act enacted in institutes a wide range of reforms  some of which may impact the company 
among other things  the act contains significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions that authorize or require the sec to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas  such as shareholder say on pay voting and proxy access 
the impact of these provisions on the company s business is uncertain 
the act also provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions  including foreign exchange and interest rate hedging transactions 
certain transactions will be required to be cleared on exchanges  and cash collateral will be required for those transactions 
while the act provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end users such as the company  the exception is subject to future rule making and interpretation by regulatory authorities 
the company enters into foreign exchange contracts  interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to manage its exposure to commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk 
if  in the future  the company is required to provide cash collateral for its hedging transactions  it could reduce the company s ability to execute strategic hedges 
in addition  the contractual counterparties in hedging arrangements will be required to comply with the act s new requirements  which could ultimately result in increased costs of these arrangements to customers such as the company 
in addition  there is recent us legislation to improve transparency and accountability concerning the sourcing of conflict minerals from mines located in the conflict zones of the democratic republic of congo drc and its adjoining countries 
the term conflict minerals currently encompasses tantalum  tin  tungsten or their ores and gold 
conflict minerals can be found in a vast array of products 
this legislation requires manufacturers  such as the company  to investigate and disclose their use of any conflict minerals originating in the drc or adjoining countries 
it also implements guidelines to assist the manufacturer in preventing  by way of performing due diligence in its supply chain  any such sourcing from potentially financing or benefiting armed groups in this area 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of  and developing an implementation strategy for  the above referenced legislation 
the company may be required to undertake a significant due diligence process requiring considerable investments of human resources and finances in order to comply with the conflict minerals due diligence and disclosure requirements 
if the company suppliers are unable or unwilling to provide it with requested information and to take other steps to ensure that no conflict minerals  financing or benefiting armed groups in the drc  are included in minerals or components supplied to the company  it may be forced to disclose in its sec filings about the use of conflict minerals in its supply chain  which may expose the company to reputational risks  which in turn could materially adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations i 
table of contents if the company s cost reduction efforts are ineffective  the company s profitability could be negatively impacted 
in response to reimbursement reductions and competitive pricing pressures  the company continues to initiate numerous cost reduction and organizational efficiency efforts  including globalization of its product lines 
the company may not be successful in achieving the operating efficiencies and operating cost reductions expected from these efforts  and the company may experience business disruptions associated with the restructuring and cost reduction activities 
these efforts may not produce the full efficiency and cost reduction benefits that the company expects 
further  these benefits may be realized later than expected  and the costs of implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated 
if these measures are not successful  the company may undertake additional cost reduction efforts  which could result in future charges 
moreover  the company s ability to achieve other strategic goals and business plans and the company s financial performance may be adversely affected and the company could experience business disruptions with customers and elsewhere if the company s cost reduction and restructuring efforts prove ineffective 
if the company information technology systems fail  or if the company experiences an interruption in the operation of its information technology systems  then the company business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company relies upon the capacity  reliability and security of its information technology  or it  systems across all of its major business functions  including research and development  manufacturing  sales  financial and administrative functions 
since the company is geographically diverse  has various business segments and has grown over the years though various acquisitions  it also has many disparate versions of it systems across its organization 
as a result of these disparate it systems  the company faces the challenge of supporting older systems and implementing upgrades when necessary 
the failure of the company information technology systems  whether resulting from the disparate versions of it systems across its various segments  business functions or otherwise  its inability to successfully maintain  enhance and or replace its information technology systems  or any compromise of the integrity or security of the data that is generated from information technology systems  or any shortcomings in the company disaster recovery platforms  could adversely affect the company results of operations  disrupt business and make the company unable  or severely limit the company ability to respond to customer demands 
in addition  the company information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters  employee or other theft  attacks by computer viruses or hackers  power outages  and computer systems  internet  telecommunications or data network failure 
any interruption of the company information technology systems could result in decreased revenue  increased expenses  increased capital expenditures  customer dissatisfaction and potential lawsuits  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company results of operations or financial condition 
the industry in which the company operates is highly competitive and some of the company s competitors may have greater financial resources than the company does 
the home medical equipment market is highly competitive and the company s products face significant competition from other well established manufacturers 
reduced government reimbursement levels and changes in reimbursement policies  such as the national competitive bidding program implemented by cms  may drive competitors  particularly those that have greater financial resources than the company to offer drastically reduced pricing terms in an effort to secure government acceptance of their products and pricing 
any increase in competition may cause the company to lose market share or compel the company to reduce prices to remain competitive  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
the consolidation of health care customers and the company s competitors could result in a loss of customers or in additional competitive pricing pressures 
numerous initiatives and reforms instituted by legislators  regulators and third party payors to reduce home medical equipment costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the home medical equipment industry as well as among the company s customers  including home health care providers 
in the past  some of the company s competitors have been lowering the purchase prices of their products in an effort to attract customers 
this in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures  including pressure to offer customers more competitive pricing terms  and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations  independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of the company s customers 
further consolidation could result in a loss of customers  increased collectability risks  or increased competitive pricing pressures 
i 
table of contents the company s products are subject to recalls  which could harm the company s reputation and business 
the company is subject to ongoing medical device reporting regulations that require the company to report to the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries if the company s products cause  or contribute to  death or serious injury  or if they malfunction and would be likely to cause  or contribute to  death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries could force the company to do a field correction or recall the company s products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacturing 
in addition  in light of a deficiency  defect in design or manufacturing or defect in labeling  the company may voluntarily elect to recall or correct the company s products 
a government mandated or voluntary recall field correction by the company could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects  including defects in labeling 
any recall field correction would divert managerial and financial resources and could harm the company s reputation with its customers  product users and the health care professionals that use  prescribe and recommend the company s products 
the company could have product recalls or field actions that result in significant costs to the company in the future  and these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s revenues and profits are subject to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations that could adversely affect its results of operations or financial position 
currency exchange rates are subject to fluctuation due to  among other things  changes in local  regional or global economic conditions  the imposition of currency exchange restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory or taxation environments 
the functional currency of the company s subsidiaries outside the united states is the predominant currency used by the subsidiaries to transact business 
through the company s international operations  the company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations  and changes in exchange rates can have a significant impact on net sales and elements of cost 
the company conducts a significant number of transactions in currencies other than the us dollar 
in addition  because certain of the company s costs and revenues are denominated in other currencies  the company s results of operations are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of those operations are translated from local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts primarily to help reduce its exposure to transactional exchange rate risk 
despite the company s efforts to mitigate these risks  however  the company s revenues and profitability may be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
the company does not have a meaningful way to hedge translation 
the company also is exposed to market risk through various financial instruments  including fixed rate and floating rate debt instruments 
the company does at times use interest swap agreements to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  but those efforts may not adequately protect the company from significant interest rate risks 
interest on much of the company s debt is based on the london interbank offered rate libor  which is currently historically low 
increases in libor could have a significant impact on the company s reported interest expense 
the company maintains cash balances globally in various financial institutions 
while the company monitors its accounts with financial institutions both domestically and internationally  recovery of funds cannot be assured in the event the financial institution would fail 
in addition  the company may be limited by foreign governments in the amount and timing of funds to be repatriated from foreign financial institutions 
as a result  this could adversely impact the company ability to fund normal operations  capital expenditures  or service debt  which could adversely affect our results 
the company is subject to certain risks inherent in managing and operating businesses in many different foreign jurisdictions 
the company has significant international operations  including operations in australia  canada  new zealand  mexico  asia primarily china and europe 
there are risks inherent in operating and selling products internationally  including different regulatory environments and reimbursement systems  difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  foreign customers who may have longer payment cycles than customers in the united states  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  tax rates in certain foreign countries that may exceed those in the united states and foreign earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements  the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country  i 
table of contents general economic and political conditions in countries where the company operates or where end users of the company s products reside  government control of capital transactions  including the borrowing of funds for operations or the expatriation of cash  potential adverse tax consequences  security concerns and potential business interruption risks associated with political and or social unrest in foreign countries where the company s facilities or assets are located  difficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries  difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries  required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  and differing consumer product preferences 
the factors described above also could disrupt the company s product manufacturing assembling and key suppliers located outside of the united states 
for example  the company increasingly relies on its manufacturing and sourcing operations in china for the production of its products 
disruptions in the company s foreign operations  particularly those in china or mexico  may impact the company s revenues and profitability 
the company may be adversely affected by legal actions or regulatory proceedings 
in addition to the risks associated with the impact of the fda consent decree  the company may be subject to claims  litigation or other liabilities as a result of injuries caused by allegedly defective products  acquisitions the company has completed or in the intellectual property area 
any such claims or litigation against the company  regardless of the merits  could result in substantial costs and could harm the company business or its reputation 
intellectual property litigation or claims also could require the company to cease manufacturing and selling any of the company s products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or redesign or rename the company s products  which may not be possible  and could be costly and time consuming and could result in lost revenues and market share 
the results of legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the company cannot provide any assurance that an action or proceeding will not be commenced against the company  or that the company will prevail in any such action or proceeding 
an unfavorable resolution of any legal action or proceeding could materially and adversely affect the company business  results of operations  liquidity or financial condition or its reputation 
product liability claims may harm the company s business  particularly if the number of claims increases significantly or the company s product liability insurance proves inadequate 
the manufacture and sale of home health care devices and related products exposes the company to a significant risk of product liability claims 
from time to time  the company has been  and is currently  subject to a number of product liability claims alleging that the use of the company s products has resulted in serious injury or even death 
even if the company is successful in defending against any liability claims  these claims could nevertheless distract the company s management  result in substantial costs  harm the company s reputation  adversely affect the sales of all the company s products and otherwise harm the company s business 
if there is a significant increase in the number of product liability claims  the company s business could be adversely affected 
the company s captive insurance company  invatection insurance company  currently has a policy year that runs from september to august and insures annual policy losses of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate of the company s north american product liability exposure 
the company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage insuring up to  in aggregate losses per policy year arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company s per country foreign liability limits  as applicable 
there can be no assurance that the company s current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates 
i 
table of contents product liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience  industry expertise and indications from the third party actuary 
additional reserves  in excess of the specific individual case reserves  are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted 
historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration to estimate the ultimate reserves 
for example  the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience  that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate 
estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and settlements on claims 
while actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves  the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices 
in addition  as a result of a product liability claim or if the company s products are alleged to be defective  the company may have to recall some of its products  may have to incur significant costs or may suffer harm to its business reputation 
decreased availability or increased costs of raw materials could increase the company s costs of producing its products 
the company purchases raw materials  fabricated components  some finished goods and services from a variety of suppliers 
raw materials such as plastics  steel and aluminum are considered key raw materials 
where appropriate  the company employs contracts with its suppliers  both domestic and international 
in those situations in which contracts are not advantageous  the company believes that its relationships with its suppliers are satisfactory and that alternative sources of supply are readily available 
from time to time  however  the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate due to global market demands  which could impair the company s ability to procure necessary materials  or increase the cost of these materials 
inflationary and other increases in costs of these raw materials have occurred in the past and may recur from time to time 
in addition  freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas 
a reduction in the supply or increase in the cost of those raw materials could impact the company s ability to manufacture its products and could increase the cost of production 
additionally  the company may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressure or other factors 
as an example  inflation in china has in the past and will probably in the future increase costs and an appreciation of the yuan or an increase in labor rates could have an unfavorable impact on the cost of key components and some finished goods 
demand in china and other developing countries for raw materials may result in increases in the cost of key commodities and could have a negative impact on the profits of the company if these increases cannot be passed onto the company s customers 
lower cost imports could negatively impact the company s profitability 
competition from lower cost imports sourced from low cost countries  such as asia  may negatively impact the company s sales volumes 
in the past  competition from certain of these products has caused the company to lower its prices  cutting into the company s profit margins and reducing the company s overall profitability 
the company s success depends on the company s ability to design  manufacture  distribute and achieve market acceptance of new products with higher functionality and lower costs 
the company sells products to customers primarily in markets that are characterized by technological change  product innovation and evolving industry standards  yet in which product price is increasingly a primary consideration in customers purchasing decisions 
the company historically has been engaged in product development and improvement programs 
however  during as a result of the fda consent decree  which is described elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the company engineering resources have been focused on quality remediation versus design of new product 
completing the remediation and receiving the fda approval on the second certification audit related to design controls will allow the company to resume design activities and start to refocus its engineering resources on new product development 
the company must continue to design and improve innovative products  effectively distribute and achieve market acceptance of those products  and reduce the costs of producing the company s products  in order to compete successfully with the company s competitors 
if competitors product development capabilities become more effective than the company s product development capabilities  if competitors new or improved products are accepted by the market before the company s products or if competitors are able to produce products at a lower cost and thus offer products for sale at a lower price  the company s business  financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 
i 
table of contents the company s business strategy relies on certain assumptions concerning demographic trends that impact the market for its products 
if these assumptions prove to be incorrect  demand for the company s products may be lower than expected 
the company s ability to achieve its business objectives is subject to a variety of factors  including the relative increase in the aging of the general population 
the company believes that these trends will increase the need for its products 
the projected demand for the company s products could materially differ from actual demand if the company s assumptions regarding these trends and acceptance of its products by health care professionals and patients prove to be incorrect or do not materialize 
if the company s assumptions regarding these factors prove to be incorrect  the company may not be able to successfully implement the company s business strategy  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in addition  the perceived benefits of these trends may be offset by competitive or business factors  such as the introduction of new products by the company s competitors or the emergence of other countervailing trends  including lower reimbursement and pricing 
the company s debt may limit the company s flexibility in operating its business 
the company million senior secured credit facility has been a principal source of financing for much of its liquidity needs 
the credit facility contains  among other things  certain financial covenants that require the company to maintain a maximum leverage ratio consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda  as defined under the credit facility of no greater than to  and a minimum interest coverage ratio consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest charges  as defined under the credit facility of no less than to in calculating the leverage ratio  the company can only exclude cash restructuring charges up to a maximum of  over the life of the agreement and the company reached the limitation in the fourth quarter of accordingly  all additional cash restructuring charges will count to reduce ebitda thereunder 
if the company were unsuccessful in meeting these covenants or other  financial or operating covenants in its credit facility  it would result in a default which could trigger acceleration of  or the right to accelerate  the related debt 
because of cross default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing certain of the company indebtedness  a default under the credit facility could result in a default under  and the acceleration of  certain other company indebtedness 
in addition  the company lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness 
these covenants could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to finance its future operations or capital needs 
furthermore  they may restrict the company s ability to conduct and expand its business and pursue its business strategies 
the company s ability to meet these financial ratios and financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond its control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  or they can be affected by government enforcement actions  such as  for example  adverse impacts from the fda consent decree of injunction 
if the company were unsuccessful in meeting those  or other  financial or operating covenants in its credit facility  it would result in a default which could trigger acceleration of  or the right to accelerate  the related debt 
the company ability to meet its liquidity needs will depend on many factors  including the operating performance of the business  the company ability to successfully complete in a timely manner the third party expert certification audit and fda inspection contemplated under the consent decree and receipt of the written notification from the fda permitting the company to resume full operations  as well as the company continued compliance with the covenants under its credit facility 
notwithstanding the company expectations  if the company operating results decline more than it currently anticipates  or if the company is unable to successfully complete the consent decree related third party expert certification audit and fda inspection within the currently estimated time frame  the company may be unable to comply with the financial covenants  and its lenders could demand repayment of the amounts outstanding under the company credit facility 
as a result  continued compliance with the leverage covenant under the company credit facility is a high priority  which means the company remains focused on generating sufficient cash and managing its expenditures 
the company also may examine alternatives such as raising additional capital through permitted asset sales 
such asset sales could be dilutive to the company results 
in addition  if necessary or advisable  the company may seek to renegotiate its credit facility in order to remain in compliance 
the company can make no assurances that under such circumstances its financing arrangements could be renegotiated  or that alternative financing would be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
the company also has an agreement with dll  a third party financing company  to provide the majority of future lease financing to invacare north america customers 
either party could terminate this agreement with days notice or days notice by dll upon the occurrence of certain events 
should this agreement be terminated  the company borrowing under the credit agreement could increase 
i 
table of contents the company capital expenditures could be higher than anticipated 
unanticipated maintenance issues  changes in government regulations or significant investments in technology and new product development could result in higher than anticipated capital expenditures  which could impact our debt  interest expense and cash flows 
the company s chairman of the board of directors and certain members of management own shares representing a substantial percentage of the company s voting power and their interests may differ from other shareholders 
the company has two classes of common stock 
the common shares have one vote per share and the class b common shares have votes per share 
as of january   the company s chairman  mr 
a 
malachi mixon  iii  and certain members of management beneficially owned including the right to acquire approximately of the combined voting power of the company s common shares and class b common shares and could influence the outcome of a corporate transaction or other matter submitted to the shareholders for approval  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets 
they also will have the power to influence or make more difficult a change in control 
the interests of mr 
mixon and his relatives may differ from the interests of the other shareholders and they may take actions with which some shareholders may disagree 
the company s operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if the company becomes involved in litigation regarding its patents or other intellectual property rights 
litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the company s industry  and other companies within the company s industry have used intellectual property litigation in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage 
the company in the past has been  and in the future may become  a party to lawsuits involving patents or other intellectual property 
if the company loses any of these proceedings  a court or a similar foreign governing body could invalidate or render unenforceable the company s owned or licensed patents  require the company to pay significant damages  seek licenses and or pay ongoing royalties to third parties  require the company to redesign its products  or prevent the company from manufacturing  using or selling its products  any of which would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company in the past has brought  and may in the future also bring  actions against third parties for infringement of the company s intellectual property rights 
the company may not succeed in these actions 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  proceedings before the us patent and trademark office or its foreign equivalents and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming 
protracted litigation to defend or prosecute the company s intellectual property rights could seriously detract from the time the company s management would otherwise devote to running its business 
intellectual property litigation relating to the company s products could cause its customers or potential customers to defer or limit their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation 
if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights or resolve successfully claims of infringement brought against it  the company product sales and business could be affected adversely 
the company business depends in part on its ability to establish  protect  safeguard and enforce its intellectual property and contractual rights and to defend against any claims of infringement  both of which involve complex legal  factual and marketplace uncertainties 
the company relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark law and security measures to protect its intellectual property  but effective intellectual property protection may not be available in all places that the company sells its products or services  particularly in certain foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  the company uses nondisclosure  confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with many of its employees  and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with certain third parties  in an effort to help protect its proprietary technology and know how 
if these agreements are breached or the company intellectual property is otherwise misappropriated  the company may have to rely on litigation to enforce its intellectual property rights 
if any of these measures are unsuccessful in protecting the company intellectual property  the company business may be affected adversely 
in addition  the company may face claims of infringement that could interfere with its ability to use technology or other intellectual property rights that are material to the company business operations 
in the event that a claim of infringement against the company is successful  the company may be required to pay royalties or license fees to continue to use technology or other intellectual property rights that the company was using  or the company may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time 
if the company is unable to obtain licenses on reasonable terms  it may be forced to cease selling or using the products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  or to redesign or  in the case of trademark claims  rename its products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties  which may not be possible  or if possible  may be time consuming 
any litigation of this type  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in i 
table of contents substantial costs to the company and adversely affect the company business and financial condition 
the company also holds patent and other intellectual property licenses from third parties for some of its products and on technologies that are necessary in the design and manufacture of some of the company products 
the loss of these licenses could prevent the company from  or could cause additional disruption or expense in  manufacturing  marketing and selling these products  which could harm the company business 
the company s research and development and manufacturing processes are subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental requirements 
the company s research and development and manufacturing processes are subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental requirements  including requirements governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water  the use  handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances and the responsibility to investigate and clean up contaminated sites 
under some of these laws  the company also could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at the company s past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
these could include costs relating to contamination that did not result from any violation of law and  in some circumstances  contamination that the company did not cause 
the company may incur significant expenses relating to the failure to comply with environmental laws 
the enactment of stricter laws or regulations  the stricter interpretation of existing laws and regulations or the requirement to undertake the investigation or remediation of currently unknown environmental contamination at the company s own or third party sites may require the company to make additional expenditures  which could be material 
since the company s ability to obtain further financing may be limited  the company may be unable to make strategic acquisitions 
the company s plans typically include identifying  analyzing  acquiring  and integrating other strategic businesses 
there are various reasons for the company to acquire businesses or product lines  including providing new products or new manufacturing and service capabilities  to add new customers  to increase penetration with existing customers  and to expand into new geographic markets 
the company s ability to successfully grow through acquisitions depends upon its ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financing 
the costs of acquiring other businesses could increase if competition for acquisition candidates increases 
further  the provisions of the company s existing credit facility impose limitations regarding acquisitions  which could prevent significant acquisitions  without entering into amendments with regard to those provisions 
if the company is unable to obtain the necessary financing  it may miss opportunities to grow its business through strategic acquisitions 
additionally  the success of the company s acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and costs  including the following the company s ability to realize operating efficiencies  synergies  or other benefits expected from an acquisition  and possible delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products  diversion of management s time and attention from other business concerns  difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired businesses who are necessary to manage these businesses  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies throughout acquired companies  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers  the risks associated with the assumption of contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets  and ability to generate future cash flows or the availability of financing 
in addition  an acquisition could materially impair the company s operating results by causing the company to incur debt or requiring the amortization of acquisition expenses and acquired assets 
the company s reported results may be adversely affected by increases in reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable 
the company has a large balance of accounts receivable and has established a reserve for the portion of such accounts receivable that the company estimates will not be collected because of the company s customers non payment 
the specific reserve is based on historical trends and current relationships with the company s customers and providers 
changes in the company s collection rates can result from a number of factors  including turnover in personnel  changes in the payment policies or practices of payors  changes in industry rates or pace of reimbursement or changes in the financial health of the company s customers 
as a result of past changes in medicare reimbursement regulations  specifically changes to the qualification processes and reimbursement levels of consumer power wheelchairs and custom power wheelchairs  the business viability of several of the company s customers had become questionable and several have failed 
further  as national competitive bidding is implemented i 
table of contents in additional areas  the number of start up or new providers who have three year contracted pricing will increase 
the company s reserve for uncollectible receivables has fluctuated in the past and will continue to fluctuate in the future 
changes in rates of collection  even if they are small in absolute terms  could require the company to increase its reserve for uncollectible receivables beyond its current level 
the company has reviewed the accounts receivables  including those receivables financed through dll  associated with many of its customers that are most exposed to these issues 
if the business viability of certain of the company s customers deteriorates or the company s credit policies are ineffective in reducing the company s exposures to credit risk  additional increases in reserves for uncollectible accounts may be necessary  which could adversely affect the company s financial results 
the loss of the services of the company s key management and personnel could adversely affect its ability to operate the company s business 
the company s future success will depend  in part  upon the continued service of key managerial  research and development staff and sales and technical personnel 
in addition  the company s future success will depend on its ability to continue to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel  including personnel experienced in quality systems and regulatory affairs 
if the company is not successful in retaining its current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future  the company s business may be adversely affected 
the company s future success depends  to a significant extent  on the abilities and efforts of its executive officers and other members of its management team 
if the company loses the services of any of its management team  the company s business may be adversely affected 
certain provisions of the company s debt agreements  its charter documents  its shareholder rights plan and ohio law could delay or prevent the sale of the company 
provisions of the company s debt agreements  its charter documents  its shareholder rights plan and ohio law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or attempt to acquire  control of the company even if a change in control would result in the purchase of shares of the company at a premium to market price 
in addition  these provisions may limit the ability of shareholders of the company to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest

table of contents item legal proceedings 
in the ordinary course of its business  invacare is a defendant in a number of lawsuits  primarily product liability actions in which various plaintiffs seek damages for injuries allegedly caused by defective products 
all of the product liability lawsuits have been referred to the company captive insurance company and or excess insurance carriers and generally are contested vigorously 
the coverage territory of the company insurance is worldwide with the exception of those countries with respect to which  at the time the product is sold for use or at the time a claim is made  the us government has suspended or prohibited diplomatic or trade relations 
management does not believe that the outcome of any of these actions will have a material adverse effect upon the company business or financial condition 
as previously disclosed  in december  the fda requested that the company agree to a consent decree of injunction with respect to the company corporate facility and its taylor street wheelchair manufacturing facility in elyria  ohio 
in december  the company reached agreement with the fda on the terms of the consent decree 
on december   a complaint and consent decree were filed in the us district court for the northern district of ohio  and on december   the court approved the consent decree and it became effective 
the consent decree limits the company manufacture and distribution of custom power and manual wheelchairs  wheelchair components and wheelchair sub assemblies at or from its taylor street manufacturing facility 
the decree also temporarily limits design activities related to wheelchairs and power beds that take place at the impacted elyria  ohio facilities 
however  the company is entitled to continue to produce from the taylor street manufacturing facility certain medically necessary products  as well as ongoing replacement  service and repair of products already in use  under terms delineated in the consent decree and is able to fulfill purchase orders and quotes that were in the company order fulfillment system prior to the effective date of the decree 
under the terms of the consent decree  in order to resume full operations at the impacted facilities  the company must successfully complete a third party expert certification audit and receive written notification from the fda 
the certification audit is comprised of three distinct reports 
the expert certification audit will be followed by an fda inspection of the company compliance with the quality system regulations 
each of the three audits will result in a third party expert report that will then be reviewed by the fda which will complete its own review procedures 
once satisfied with the company compliance  the fda will provide written notification that the company is permitted to resume full operations at the impacted facilities 
the company cannot currently estimate the timing of the fda written notifications 
at the time of filing this annual report on form k  the company has initiated the first two of its third party expert certification audits 
barring any unexpected developments or the requirement to perform additional remediation activities as a result of the third party expert audits  the company expects the first two certification audits to be completed in the first quarter of as of the time of this filing  the third expert certification audit has commenced and the company plans to complete the audit in the second quarter of because the fda has the authority to reinspect at any time  the company cannot determine whether the fda will elect to inspect after either the first or second third party expert audits 
according to the consent decree  the fda has thirty days after receipt of the third expert certification audit results to commence its own inspection 
it is not possible for the company to estimate the timing or potential response of the fda inspection and subsequent written notifications 
in a letter dated february   the fda notified the company that  in the fda review of approved verification of medical necessity vmn forms submitted thus far  it found that the company failed to reject certain vmn forms which the fda considered inadequately completed  and that similar failures in the future could result in the assessment of liquidated damages under the terms of the consent decree 
the company has had discussions with and responded to the fda and has taken actions to address fda concerns by enhancing the company rigorous vmn review process 
in addition  the company continues to provide training and feedback to providers and clinicians to educate them on the expectations for properly completing the vmn forms

table of contents item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
outlook the company fiscal year was dominated by its consent decree negotiations with the fda which concluded when the consent decree became effective on december  the consent decree of injunction limits the company manufacture and distribution of custom power and manual wheelchairs  wheelchair components and wheelchair subassemblies at or from its taylor street manufacturing facility 
the decree also temporarily limits design activities related to wheelchairs and power beds that take place at the impacted elyria  ohio facilities 
in order to resume full operations at the impacted elyria  ohio facilities  the company must successfully complete a three step third party expert certification audit that will be followed by an fda inspection 
the company has initiated the first two of its third party expert certification audits 
the first addresses the equipment and process validation procedures in the taylor street manufacturing facility and the second addresses the company design control procedures at the corporate facility 
barring any unexpected developments or the requirement to perform additional remediation activities as a result of the third party expert audits  the company expects the first two certification audits to be completed in the first quarter of at the time of filing this annual report on form k  the third expert certification audit has commenced and the company plans to complete the audit in the second quarter of because the fda has the authority to reinspect at any time  the company cannot determine whether the fda will elect to inspect after either the first or second third party expert audits 
according to the consent decree  the fda has thirty days after receipt of the third expert certification audit results to commence its own inspection 
it is not possible for the company to estimate the timing or potential response of the fda inspection and subsequent written notification and thus  it is uncertain whether normal operations will resume before the end of completing the remediation and receiving the fda approval on the second certification audit related to design controls will allow the company to resume design activities and refocus its engineering resources on new product development 
introducing new product solutions to the market will get the company back on track to regaining market share and resuming its globalization program designed to harmonize core product offerings and deliver on its long term goal of million in cost improvements and re establish high single digit operating margins 
since the consent decree became effective  new orders for power wheelchairs  one of the company most profitable product lines  have declined substantially compared to the same period last year  primarily due to the consent decree limitations on the company ability to manufacture  assemble and distribute wheelchairs at or from its taylor street manufacturing facility 
as the company has previously disclosed  the consent decree contains several important exceptions  as follows a 
the company may continue to fulfill orders and written quotes that were already in the company order fulfillment system as of the december  effective date of the consent decree  as long as the provider completes a form certifying that he or she is aware of the decree and would still like for the company to fulfill the order 
b 
the company may manufacture and distribute a user replacement chair and or seating system when a user requests the same or newer version of his her existing product  and the clinician submits a verification of medical necessity form that acknowledges the existence of the consent decree 
c 
the company may manufacture and distribute wheelchairs or seating systems from the taylor street facility  if a clinical evaluation determines that the product is medically necessary to meet a particular user needs which cannot be appropriately addressed by another manufacturer product  and the clinician and the user physician complete and submit a verification of medical necessity form 
d 
other exemptions exist to allow for ongoing service  repair and warranty replacement of products already in use as long as the provider completes a form certifying that he or she is aware of the consent decree and that the parts and components they receive will be used solely for the service or repair of the company wheelchairs already in use 
providers and medical professionals  who are already over burdened with substantial documentation obligations to satisfy reimbursement requirements  have struggled to complete the additional documentation needed to obtain an invacare wheelchair or seating system for their users 
in addition  the company reviews each signed verification of medical necessity vmn form for new and replacement wheelchairs and or seating systems to ensure that it is appropriately completed 
in instances where the vmn form has been found by the company to be improperly completed  or where the explanation of medical necessity is not deemed sufficient to justify the product order  the company rejects the vmn and returns it to the clinician  and the order remains on hold until the company receives the appropriately completed vmn 
the company is required to submit to the fda copies of each approved vmn the company receives during the first days after the effective date of the consent decree 
in a letter dated february   the fda notified the company that  in the fda review of approved vmn forms submitted thus far  it found that the i 
table of contents company failed to reject certain vmn forms which the fda considered inadequately completed and that similar failures in the future could result in the assessment of liquidated damages under the terms of the consent decree 
the company has had discussions with the fda and has taken actions to address fda concerns by enhancing the company rigorous vmn review process 
in addition  the company continues to provide training and feedback to providers and clinicians to educate them on the expectations for properly completing the vmn forms 
at the time of filing this annual report on form k  the number of orders which the company has fulfilled with the appropriate vmn documentation requirements is substantially lower than comparable order volume during the same period last year 
in  the company expects continued pressure on its organic net sales  cash flow and operating profitability 
the key drivers of these pressures include the ongoing quality systems remediation costs  the related diversion of resources  and the limited production at its taylor street wheelchair manufacturing facility in elyria  ohio  due to the consent decree 
in addition  the company has been unable to invest in the development or introduction of new products while it focuses its engineering resources on its quality systems remediation 
further  the consent decree enjoins the company from design activities related to wheelchairs and power beds at its corporate facility until it receives approval from the fda on the second expert certification audit 
as described above  the company educates customers on the new documentation requirements  particularly the more detailed verification of medical necessity forms for new wheelchairs and or seating systems  the company is experiencing slowness in incoming orders of new wheelchairs from the taylor street facility 
the company is focused on completing its expert certification audits as quickly and efficiently as possible 
the company also is facing external challenges within its north america hme segment 
in addition to customers coping with prepayment reviews and post payment audits of power mobility devices from medicare and medicaid  the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms recently announced the bid rates for the second round of national competitive bidding ncb  which are substantially lower than current average prices 
the company continues to expect pressure on net sales as providers that were successful bidders in the metropolitan statistical areas finalize the contracting process with cms 
looking forward  the company is positioned to assist hme providers in managing the price reductions associated with ncb  and it will remain judicious in its extension of credit to customers in these areas 
the company has worked closely with providers over the last two years in preparation for ncb  offering programs to assist them in improving their operational efficiency  as well as products that serve to expand market opportunities 
as described elsewhere in this annual report on form k  for the fiscal quarter and the fiscal year ended december   the company had a net loss from continuing operations of per share and per share  respectively 
these results are indicative of the pressures on the company net sales that were present throughout  even before the fda consent decree became effective 
while  at the time of this filing  the consent decree had been effective for only approximately two months and thus  the effect on customer orders and net sales was not yet clear  the company expects to experience further declines in net sales as a result of the limitations imposed by the consent decree 
the company expects to continue to experience decreased net sales in the north america hme segment until it has successfully completed the previously described third party expert certification audit and fda inspection and has received written notification from the fda that the company may resume full operations 
for the north america hme segment  total mobility and seating sales were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  however  not all the product lines included in these amounts were manufactured at the taylor street facility 
the company does not track net sales by production facility 
therefore  the company has estimated net sales attributable to the taylor street facility by segregating the net sales for the north america hme segment by business unit and product line and then estimating whether the product lines were sourced from the taylor street facility 
based on this methodology  the company estimates that total net sales related to products produced at the taylor street facility were approximately  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  even after the company receives the fda notification that it may resume full operations at its taylor street facility  it is uncertain as to whether  or how quickly  the company will be able to rebuild net sales to more typical historical levels  irrespective of market conditions 
accordingly  the company expects that these challenges could negatively impact the company operating results in to an even greater degree than was experienced in discontinued operations as part of the company globalization strategy  and to allow the company to focus on its core equipment product lines  the company completed the sale of its medical supplies business  invacare supply group isg  on january  the transaction was completed pursuant to a share purchase agreement that was entered into on december  under the terms of the sale  the company received approximately  in cash  which is subject to final post closing adjustments  with net proceeds from the sale of approximately  net of expenses 
i 
table of contents the company will recognize  in its financial statements for the first quarter ended march   a net after tax gain of approximately   pre tax from the sale transaction  which represents the excess of the net sales price over the book value of the assets and liabilities of isg as of the date of completion of the disposition 
the company utilized the proceeds from the sale to reduce debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility in the first quarter of going forward  the sale of this business is expected to be dilutive to the company results 
as a result of the company decision to sell the business in december  the assets and liabilities of isg were reflected as assets and liabilities held for sale at the end of and assets and liabilities held for sale were comprised of the following in thousands december  december  trade receivables  net inventories  net other current assets goodwill property  plant and equipment  net assets held for sale current assets held for sale non current accounts payable accrued expenses accrued income taxes liabilities held for sale current unless otherwise noted  the following discussions of the net results of the company and its segments exclude the discontinued operation of isg

charge related to restructuring activities 
the company restructuring charges were necessitated primarily by continued declines in medicare and medicaid reimbursement by the us government  as well as similar healthcare reimbursement pressures abroad  which negatively affect the company customers eg home health care providers  coupled with continued pricing pressures faced by the company as a result of outsourcing by competitors to lower cost locations 
while the company restructuring efforts have been executed on a timely basis  resulting in operating cost savings  the savings have been more than offset by continued margin decline  principally as a result of product mix  and higher regulatory and compliance costs related to quality system improvements which are unrelated to the restructuring actions

the credit agreement also provides for the issuance of swing line loans 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest  at the company election  at i the london inter bank offer rate libor plus a margin  or ii a base rate option plus a margin 
the applicable margin is currently per annum for libor loans and for the base rate option loans based on the company leverage ratio 
in addition to interest  the company is required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the credit agreement 
the commitment fee rate is currently per annum 
like the interest rate spreads  the commitment fee is subject to adjustment based on the company leverage ratio 
the obligations of the borrowers under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the company us assets and are guaranteed by substantially all of the company material domestic and foreign subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains certain covenants that are customary for similar credit arrangements  including covenants relating to  among other things  financial reporting and notification  compliance with laws  preservation of existence  maintenance of books and records  use of proceeds  maintenance of properties and insurance  and limitations on liens  dispositions  issuance of debt  investments  payment of dividends  repurchases of capital stock  acquisitions  transactions with affiliates  and capital expenditures 
there also are financial covenants that require the company to maintain a maximum leverage ratio consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda  each as defined in the credit agreement of no greater than to  and a minimum interest coverage ratio consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest charges  each as defined in the credit agreement of no less than to in calculating the ratios  the company can on exclude up to  of cash restructuring charges from the calculation of ebitda over the life of the agreement  and the company reached the limitation in the fourth quarter of thus  all additional cash restructuring charges will count to reduce ebitda thereunder 
as of december   the company leverage ratio was and the company interest coverage ratio was compared to a leverage ratio of and an interest coverage ratio of as of december  as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenant requirements and  under the most restrictive covenant of the company borrowing arrangements  the company had the capacity to borrow up to an additional  the company credit agreement  as well as cash flows from operations  has been a principal source of financing for much of its liquidity needs 
if the company were unsuccessful in meeting its leverage or interest coverage ratio  or other  financial or operating covenants in its credit facility  it would result in a default  which could trigger acceleration of  or the right to accelerate  the related debt 
because of cross default provisions in the agreements and instruments governing certain of the company indebtedness  a default under the credit facility could result in a default under  and the acceleration of  certain other company indebtedness 
in addition  the company lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness 
since december   the company has completed the sale of its isg business for net proceeds of approximately  which were used to repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility and other current payables and thereby improve the company leverage ratio 
based on the company current expectations  the company believes that its cash balances  cash generated by operations and available borrowing capacity under its senior credit facility should be sufficient to meet working capital needs  capital requirements  and commitments for at least the next twelve months 
however  the company ability to satisfy its liquidity needs will depend on many factors  including the operating performance of the business  the company ability to successfully complete in a timely manner the third party expert certification audit and fda inspection contemplated under the consent decree and receipt of the written notification from the fda permitting the company to resume full operations  as well as the company continued compliance with the covenants under its credit facility 
notwithstanding the company expectations  if the company operating results decline substantially more than it currently anticipates  or if the company is unable to successfully complete the consent decree related third party expert certification audit and fda inspection within the currently estimated time frame including as a result of any need to complete significant additional remediation arising from the third party expert certification audits of the fda inspection  the company may be unable to comply with the financial covenants  and its lenders could demand repayment of the amounts outstanding under the company credit facility 
as a result  continued compliance with the leverage covenant under the company credit facility is a high priority  which means the company remains focused on generating sufficient cash and managing its expenditures 
the company also may examine alternatives such as raising additional capital through permitted asset sales 
in addition  if necessary or advisable  the company may seek to renegotiate its credit facility in order to remain in compliance 
the company can make no assurances that under such circumstances our financing arrangements could be renegotiated  or that alternative financing would be available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all

while there is general concern about the potential for rising interest rates  the company believes that its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is manageable given that portions of the company debt are at fixed rates into  the company has the ability to utilize swaps to exchange variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  if needed  and the company free cash flow should allow it to absorb any modest rate increases in the months ahead without any material impact on its liquidity or capital resources 
the company is a party to interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of floating rate revolving credit facility debt to fixed rate debt to avoid the risk of changes in market interest rates 
specifically  interest rate swap agreements  as of december   for notional amounts of  through february   and  through may   through june   through september and  and  through april were entered into that fix the libor component of the interest rate on that portion of the revolving credit facility debt at rates of      and  respectively  for effective aggregate rates of      and  respectively

critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements included in the report include accounts of the company and all majority owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing the financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition invacare s revenues are recognized when products are shipped or services provided to unaffiliated customers 
revenue recognition  asc  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with gaap and asc shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
sales are made only to customers with whom the company believes collection is reasonably assured based upon a credit analysis  which may include obtaining a credit application  a signed security agreement  personal guarantee and or a cross corporate guarantee depending on the credit history of the customer 
credit lines are established for new customers after an evaluation of their credit report and or other relevant financial information 
existing credit lines are regularly reviewed and adjusted with consideration given to any outstanding past due amounts 
i 
table of contents the company offers discounts and rebates  which are accounted for as reductions to revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized 
discounts offered include cash discounts for prompt payment  base and trade discounts based on contract level for specific classes of customers 
volume discounts and rebates are given based on large purchases and the achievement of certain sales volumes 
product returns are accounted for as a reduction to reported sales with estimates recorded for anticipated returns at the time of sale 
the company does not ship any goods on consignment 
distributed products sold by the company are accounted for in accordance with the revenue recognition guidance in asc the company records distributed product sales gross as a principal since the company takes title to the products and has the risks of loss for collections  delivery and returns 
product sales that give rise to installment receivables are recorded at the time of sale when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred 
interest income is recognized on installment agreements in accordance with the terms of the agreements 
installment accounts are monitored and if a customer defaults on payments  interest income is no longer recognized 
all installment accounts are accounted for using the same methodology  regardless of duration of the installment agreements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on management evaluation of the financial condition of the customer 
in addition  as a result of the third party financing arrangement  management monitors the collection status of these contracts in accordance with the company limited recourse obligations and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts and establishing reserves for specific customers as needed 
the company continues to closely monitor the credit worthiness of its customers and adhere to tight credit policies 
during the first quarter of  the centers for medicare and medicaid services implemented the single payment amounts for round of the national competitive bidding program in nine metropolitan statistical areas msas 
the single payment amounts are used to determine the price that medicare pays for certain durable medical equipment  prosthetics  orthotics and supplies 
the company believes the changes announced could have a significant impact on the collectability of accounts receivable for those customers which are in the msa locations impacted and which have a portion of their revenues tied to medicare reimbursement 
as a result  this is an additional risk factor which the company considers when assessing the collectability of accounts receivable 
invacare has an agreement with dll  a third party financing company  to provide the majority of future lease financing to invacare north america customers 
the dll agreement provides for direct leasing between dll and the invacare customer 
the company retains a recourse obligation for events of default under the contracts 
the company monitors the collections status of these contracts and has provided amounts for estimated losses in its allowances for doubtful accounts 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
a provision for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded as needed based upon the discontinuation of products  redesigning of existing products  new product introductions  market changes and safety issues 
both raw materials and finished goods are reserved for on the balance sheet 
in general  invacare reviews inventory turns as an indicator of obsolescence or slow moving product as well as the impact of new product introductions 
depending on the situation  the company may partially or fully reserve for the individual item 
the company continues to increase its overseas sourcing efforts  increase its emphasis on the development and introduction of new products  and decrease the cycle time to bring new product offerings to market 
these initiatives are sources of inventory obsolescence for both raw material and finished goods 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  equipment  intangibles and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
under intangibles goodwill and other  asc  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
the company measurement date for its annual goodwill impairment test is october furthermore  goodwill and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
i 
table of contents to review goodwill for impairment in accordance with asc  the company first estimates the fair value of each reporting unit and compares the calculated fair value to the carrying value of the each reporting unit 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below 
the company has determined that its reporting units are the same as its operating segments 
the company completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
to estimate the fair values of the reporting units  the company utilizes a discounted cash flow method dcf in which the company forecasts income statement and balance sheet amounts based on assumptions regarding future sales growth  profitability  inventory turns  days sales outstanding  etc 
to forecast future cash flows 
the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital discount rate where the cost of debt is based on quoted rates for year debt of companies of similar credit risk and the cost of equity is based upon the year treasury rate for the risk free rate  a market risk premium  the industry average beta and a small cap stock adjustment 
the discount rates used have a significant impact upon the discounted cash flow methodology utilized in the company annual impairment testing as higher discount rates decrease the fair value estimates 
the assumptions used are based on a market participant point of view and yielded a discount rate of in for the company annual impairment analysis compared to in and in the company also utilizes an ev enterprise value to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization method to compute the fair value of its reporting units which considers potential acquirers and their ev to ebitda multiples adjusted by an estimated premium 
while more weight is given to the discounted cash flow method  the ev to ebitda method does provide corroborative evidence of the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow method results 
in  the results of the company step i annual impairment test indicated a potential impairment in the north america hme segment 
the goodwill for this segment was deemed impaired and thus written off in accordingly  the company proceeded with a review for potential impairments of any other assets related to the segment  specifically the company taylor street facility which is subject to the consent decree injunction that limits the company manufacture and distribution of custom power and manual wheelchairs  wheelchair components and wheelchair subassemblies at the taylor street facility 
the company determined there was no impairment of the property  plant and equipment of the taylor street facility based on a comparison of the forecasted un discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the net assets in accordance with asc in addition  the company determined there was no impairment of inventory associated with the facility 
in  the results of the company step i annual impairment test indicated a potential impairment in the asia pacific segment 
as a result  the company completed a step ii impairment test for this segment 
pursuant to asc  the company compared the forecasted un discounted cash flows of the asia pacific segment to the carrying value of the net assets  which indicated no impairment of any other long lived assets 
as part of the step ii test  the company calculated the fair value of all recorded and unrecorded assets and liabilities to determine the goodwill impairment amount 
as a result of reduced profitability in the asia pacific segment in the fourth quarter of  uncertainty associated with future market conditions  and based on the step ii calculated results  the company recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill in the asia pacific segment of  in the fourth quarter of  which represented the entire goodwill amount for the segment 
in december  the fda requested that the company agree to a consent decree of injunction at the company corporate facility and its wheelchair manufacturing facility in elyria  ohio  the proposed terms of which would require the suspension of certain operations at those facilities until they are certified by the company and then determined by the fda to be in compliance with fda quality system regulations 
in accordance with asc  a significant decline in the company stock price and market capitalization  as occurred following the announcement of the consent decree  should be considered as indicators of possible impairment that would require an interim assessment of goodwill for impairment 
as a result of the potential impact of the fda consent decree  the company updated the assumptions and variables in its dcf model as of december  in regards to the na hme segment  the segment primarily affected by the consent decree  and factored in a basis point risk premium to the discount rate used to reflect the increased uncertainty with the company forecasted cash flows for the reporting unit 
the risk premium adjustment was calculated by the company by considering the decline in the company stock price as well as the company ebitda multiple 
the premium adjustment was made as the company was not able to produce a range of cash flows given the lack of clarity on the final terms of the consent decree 
the results of the calculation as of december  confirmed that the carrying value of the na hme reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
pursuant to asc  the company compared the forecasted un discounted cash flows of the na hme segment to the carrying value of the net assets  which indicated no impairment of any other long lived assets 
the company then conducted a step ii test in which the fair values of all recorded and unrecorded assets and liabilities were calculated to determine the impairment charge of  which represented the entire goodwill amount for the segment 
while there was no indication of impairment in related to goodwill for the europe or ipg segments  a future potential impairment is possible for these segments should actual results differ materially from forecasted results used in the valuation analysis 
furthermore  the company annual valuation of goodwill can differ materially if the market inputs used to determine the discount rate change significantly 
for instance  higher interest rates or greater stock price volatility would increase the discount i 
table of contents rate and thus increase the chance of impairment 
in consideration of this potential  the company reviewed the results if the discount rate used were basis points higher for the impairment analysis and determined that there still would not be an indicator of potential impairment for the europe or ipg segments 
the company intangible assets consist of intangible assets with defined lives as well as intangible assets with indefinite lives 
defined lived intangible assets consist principally of customer lists  developed technology  license agreements  patents and other miscellaneous intangibles such as non compete agreements 
the company indefinite lived intangible assets consist entirely of trademarks 
the company evaluates the carrying value of definite lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment 
definite lived assets are determined to be impaired if the future un discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value 
actual impairment amounts for definite lived assets are then calculated using a discounted cash flow calculation 
the company reviews indefinite lived assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate possible impairment 
any impairment amounts for indefinite lived assets are calculated as the difference between the future discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset less than the carrying value for the asset 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recognized intangible write down charges of  comprised of trademark impairment of  and developed technology impairment of  in the ipg segment and a patent impairment of  in the na hme segment 
the after tax and pre tax impairment amounts were the same for each of the above impairments except for the trademark impairment in the ipg segment which was  after tax 
as a result of the company intangible impairment review  the company recognized intangible write down charges of  comprised of customer list impairment of  in the ipg segment  customer list impairment of  in the na hme segment  indefinite lived trademark impairment of  in the europe segment and an intellectual property impairment of  in the asia pacific segment 
the after tax and pre tax impairment amounts were the same for each of the above impairments except for the indefinite lived trademark impairment in the europe segment which was  after tax 
the fair value of the customer lists were calculated using an excess earnings method  using a discounted cash flow model 
estimated cash flow returns to the customer relationship were reduced by the cash flows required to satisfy the return requirements of each of the assets employed with the residual cash flow then discounted to value the customer relationship 
the fair value of the trademark and developed technology was calculated using a relief from royalty payment methodology which requires applying an estimated market royalty rate to forecasted net sales and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
the intellectual properly intangible asset was impaired as the intellectual property was determined to be no longer viable and is no longer being used 
product liability the company s captive insurance company  invatection insurance co  currently has a policy year that runs from september to august and insures annual policy losses of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate of the company s north american product liability exposure 
the company also has additional layers of external insurance coverage insuring up to  in aggregate losses per policy year arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company s per country foreign liability limits  as applicable 
there can be no assurance that invacare s current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates 
product liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience  industry expertise and indications from the third party actuary 
additional reserves  in excess of the specific individual case reserves  are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon third party actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted 
historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the third party actuary to estimate the ultimate reserves 
for example  the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience  that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate 
estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and settlements on claims 
while actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves  the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices 
i 
table of contents warranty generally  the company s products are covered from the date of sale to the customer by warranties against defects in material and workmanship for various periods depending on the product 
certain components carry a lifetime warranty 
a provision for estimated warranty cost is recorded at the time of sale based upon actual experience 
the company continuously assesses the adequacy of its product warranty accrual and makes adjustments as needed 
historical analysis is primarily used to determine the company s warranty reserves 
claims history is reviewed and provisions are adjusted as needed 
however  the company does consider other events  such as a product recall  which could warrant additional warranty reserve provision 
see warranty costs in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for a reconciliation of the changes in the warranty accrual 
accounting for stock based compensation the company accounts for share based compensation under the provisions of compensation stock compensation  asc the company has not made any modifications to the terms of any previously granted options and no changes have been made regarding the valuation methodologies or assumptions used to determine the fair value of options granted and the company continues to use a black scholes valuation model 
as of december   there was  of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock based compensation arrangements granted under the performance plan  which is related to non vested options and shares  and includes  related to restricted stock awards 
the company expects the compensation expense to be recognized over a four year period for a weighted average period of approximately two years 
the substantial majority of the options awarded have been granted at exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
restricted stock awards granted without cost to the recipients are expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting periods 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing its financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in various jurisdictions 
the process requires estimating the company s current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  as well as estimating temporary differences due to the different treatment of items for tax and accounting policies 
the temporary differences are reported as deferred tax assets and or liabilities 
substantially all of the company s us  australia  new zealand and denmark deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance 
the company also must estimate the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and whether or not valuation allowances should be established 
in the event that actual results differ from its estimates  the company s provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
the company does not believe that there is a substantial likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to its critical accounting policies 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu or the asu 
asu requires comprehensive income to be reported in either a single statement or in two consecutive statements reporting net income and other comprehensive income oci

the company adopted asu in the first quarter form q with no impact on the company financial position  results of operations or cash flows other than the modification to the company consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk through various financial instruments  including fixed rate and floating rate debt instruments 
the company does at times use interest swap agreements to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
based on december  debt levels  a change in interest rates would impact annual interest expense by approximately  additionally  the company operates internationally and  as a result  is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
specifically  the exposure results from intercompany loans  intercompany sales or payments and third party sales or payments 
in an attempt to reduce this exposure  foreign currency forward contracts are utilized to hedge intercompany purchases and sales as well as third party purchases and sales 
the company does not believe that any potential loss related to these financial instruments would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
i 
table of contents the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert a portion of floating rate revolving credit facility debt to fixed rate debt to avoid the risk of changes in market interest rates 
specifically  interest rate swap agreements  as of december   for notional amounts of  through february   and  through may   through june   through september and  and  through april were entered into that fix the libor component of the interest rate on that portion of the revolving credit facility debt at rates of      and  respectively  for effective aggregate rates of      and  respectively 
on october   the company entered into the credit agreement which provides for a  senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in october at variable rates 
as of december   the company had outstanding  in principal amount of convertible senior subordinated debentures due in february  of which  is included in equity 
accordingly  while the company is exposed to increases in interest rates  its exposure to the volatility of the current market environment is limited as the company does not currently need to re finance any of its debt 
however  the company s credit agreement contains covenants with respect to  among other items  consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and interest coverage  as defined in the agreement 
the company is in compliance with all covenant requirements  but should it fall out of compliance with these requirements  the company would have to attempt to obtain alternative financing and thus likely be required to pay much higher interest rates
