item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our operating results by business segment 
the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows european union eastern europe  middle east africa asia latin america canada our management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on operating companies income  which we define as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements and are incorporated herein by reference to the annual report 
we use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products  net of sales and promotion incentives 
our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors  including the volume of products we sell  the price of our products  changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell 

table of contents mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium price brands to mid price or low price brands in any given market product mix 
mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets geographic mix 
we often collect excise taxes from our customers and then remit them to local governments  and  in those circumstances  we include excise taxes in our net revenues and excise taxes on products 
our cost of sales consists principally of tobacco leaf  non tobacco raw materials  labor and manufacturing costs 
our marketing  administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products  other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products including general corporate expenses  and costs incurred to develop new products 
the most significant components of our marketing  administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses 
c narrative description of business our subsidiaries and affiliates and their licensees manufacture  market and sell tobacco products outside the united states 
our total cigarette shipments increased in to billion units 
we estimate that international cigarette market shipments were approximately trillion units in  a increase over we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market which is defined as worldwide cigarette volume excluding the united states was approximately in  in and in excluding the people s republic of china prc  we estimate that our reported share of the international cigarette market was approximately   and in  and  respectively 
shipments of our principal cigarette brand  marlboro  increased in  and represented approximately of the international cigarette market  excluding the prc  in  in and in we have a cigarette market share of at least  and  in a number of instances substantially more than  in markets  including algeria  argentina  australia  austria  belgium  canada  colombia  the czech republic  egypt  finland  france  germany  greece  hungary  indonesia  italy  japan  kazakhstan  korea  mexico  the netherlands  the philippines  poland  portugal  romania  russia  saudi arabia  serbia  singapore  spain  sweden  switzerland  thailand  turkey and ukraine 
references to total international cigarette market  total cigarette market  total market and market shares in this form k reflect our best estimates based on a number of internal and external sources 
consumer focused marketing sales in  we launched a new strategic framework that combines our marketing and sales expertise with our in depth knowledge of various sales territories 
this framework allows us not only to engage more effectively with our adult consumers but also to enhance the success of our direct and indirect trade partners 
the main benefits are improved effectiveness of direct adult consumer engagement activities  more effective communication with our retailers about our brands  increased speed  efficiency and widespread availability of our products  and distribution and sales strategies tailored to the individual characteristics of each market namely  the needs and capabilities of retailers  the wholesale infrastructure  our competitive position  operating costs and the regulatory framework 
the four main types of distribution that we use globally  often simultaneously in a given market  are direct sales and distribution  where we have set up our own distribution directly to retailers  distribution through single independent distributors who are responsible for distribution in a single market  exclusive zonified distribution  where distributors are assigned an exclusive territory within a market to enable them to obtain a suitable return on their investment  and distribution through national or regional wholesalers that then supply the retail trade 
in many markets we also directly supply key accounts  including gas stations  retail chains and supermarkets 
our distribution and sales systems are supported by sales forces that total approximately  employees worldwide 
our sales forces are well trained and recognized by trade surveys for their professionalism 

table of contents our products are marketed and promoted through various media and channels  including  where permitted by law  point of sale communications  brand events  access restricted web sites  print and direct communication to verified adult smokers 
our direct communication with verified adult smokers utilizes mail  e mail and other electronic communication tools 
promotional activities include  where permitted by law  competitions  invitations to events  interactive programs  consumer premiums and price promotions 
to support advertising and promotional activities in the markets  we have a dedicated consumer engagement group that develops innovative engagement tools for adult consumers based on the latest technologies and adult consumer trends 
competition we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  brand recognition  brand loyalty  taste  innovation  packaging  service  marketing  advertising and retail price 
our competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and  in some instances  state owned tobacco enterprises  principally in algeria  egypt  the prc  taiwan  thailand and vietnam 
industry consolidation and privatizations of state owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures 
some competitors have different profit and volume objectives  and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates 
we compete predominantly with american blend cigarette brands  such as marlboro  l m and chesterfield  which are the most popular across many of our markets 
we seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories  although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium price category 
procurement and raw materials we purchase tobacco leaf of various grades and styles throughout the world  the majority through independent tobacco suppliers 
we also contract directly with farmers in several countries including argentina  brazil  colombia  the dominican republic  ecuador  italy  kazakhstan  mexico  pakistan  the philippines  poland  and the united states 
as discussed above  in june  we announced that our affiliate  pmb  began directly sourcing tobacco leaf from tobacco farmers in southern brazil 
this initiative expanded pmi s direct involvement in the supply chain and provides approximately of pmi s global leaf requirements 
our largest sources of supply are brazil  particularly for virginia tobaccos but also for burley  the united states for virginia flue cured and burley tobaccos  particularly higher quality varieties for use in leading international brands  indonesia  mostly for domestic use in kretek products  turkey and greece  mostly for oriental  and argentina and malawi  mostly for burley 
we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements 
in addition to tobacco leaf  we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately suppliers 
our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represent approximately of our total direct materials purchases 
the three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging  acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in cigarette manufacturing 
in addition  the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our indonesian business

employees as of december   we employed approximately  people worldwide  including employees under temporary contracts and hourly paid part time staff 
our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees 
generally  these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business 
in addition  in accordance with european union requirements  we have established a european works council composed of management and elected members of our workforce

research and development one of our strategic priorities is to develop  assess and commercialize a portfolio of innovative products with the potential to reduce the risk of smoking related diseases in comparison to conventional cigarettes 
we refer to these as next generation products  or ngps 
pmi draws upon a team of world class scientists from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines  whose efforts are guided by the following key objectives to develop a series of products that provides adult smokers the taste  sensory experience and smoking ritual characteristics that are as close as possible to those currently provided by conventional cigarettes  to substantiate a significant reduction of risk for the individual adult smoker as well as a reduction of harm for the population as a whole  based on robust scientific evidence derived from well established assessment processes  and to advocate for the development of regulatory frameworks for the assessment  approval and commercialization of ngps  including the communication of substantiated reductions in risk to consumers 
we believe the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation is the most promising path to reduce risk and  accordingly  the ngps we are developing are based on platforms that do not involve combustion 
these platforms are in various stages of development 
one platform is in the early stages of clinical trials and industrial scale up  another is in its final development phase  and the third requires at least one year for further product development 
we are also developing other potential platforms 
our approach to individual risk assessment is to use cessation as the benchmark because the short term and long term effects of smoking cessation are well known and the closer the clinical data derived from adult smokers who switch to an ngp resemble the data from those who quit  the more confident one can be that the product reduces the risk 
we also conduct research to support and reinforce our conventional product business 
we seek to be at the forefront of innovation 
significant investments have been made in new product development efforts for conventional products  resulting in a wide range of product enhancements and the launch of innovative new products 
further  with the increase in product regulations  support for the conventional cigarette business has expanded and is expected to become more complex  requiring additional capacity for analysis and testing in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
finally  working through biotechnology partners  we are conducting research and development on technology platforms that can potentially lead to the development of alternative uses of tobacco

table of contents risks related to our business and industry cigarettes are subject to substantial taxes 
significant increases in cigarette related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions 
these tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors 
tax regimes  including excise taxes  sales taxes and import duties  can disproportionately affect the retail price of manufactured cigarettes versus other tobacco products  or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our manufactured cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors 
because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium price manufactured cigarette category  tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets 
as a result  our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets 
increases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes  due to resulting lower consumption levels  a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other tobacco products and from the premium price to the mid price or low price cigarette categories  where we may be under represented  from local sales to legal cross border purchases of lower price products  or to illicit products such as contraband  counterfeit and illicit whites 
our business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products 
governmental actions  combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking  have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets  and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase downtrading and the risk of counterfeiting  contraband and cross border purchases 
significant regulatory developments will take place over the next few years in most of our markets  driven principally by the world health organization framework convention on tobacco control fctc 
the fctc is the first international public health treaty on tobacco  and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation 
the fctc has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to reduce the palatability and attractiveness of tobacco products to adult smokers 
regulatory initiatives that have been proposed  introduced or enacted include restrictions on or licensing of outlets permitted to sell cigarettes  the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges  restrictions or bans on advertising  marketing and sponsorship  the display of larger health warnings  graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements  restrictions on packaging design  including the use of colors  and plain packaging  restrictions on packaging and cigarette formats and dimensions  restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines  requirements regarding testing  disclosure and performance standards for tar  nicotine  carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents  disclosure  restrictions  or bans of tobacco product ingredients  increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and  in some instances  in private places and outdoors  elimination of duty free sales and duty free allowances for travelers  and encouraging litigation against tobacco companies 
our operating income could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands  in particular requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products  as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements 
litigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ets could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity 
there is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions 
damages claimed in some tobacco related litigation are significant and  in certain cases in brazil  canada  israel and nigeria  range into the billions of 
table of contents us dollars 
we anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed 
the fctc encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers 
it is possible that our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation 
see item legal proceedings of this form k 
we face intense competition  and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  brand recognition  brand loyalty  taste  innovation  packaging  service  marketing  advertising and price 
we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions  erosion of consumer confidence  competitors introduction of lower price products or innovative products  higher tobacco product taxes  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories  and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products 
competitors include three large international tobacco companies and several regional and local tobacco companies and  in some instances  state owned tobacco enterprises  principally in algeria  china  egypt  taiwan  thailand and vietnam 
industry consolidation and privatizations of state owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures 
some competitors have different profit and volume objectives and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates 
because we have operations in numerous countries  our results may be influenced by economic  regulatory and political developments or natural disasters in many countries 
some of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes 
in others  nationalization  terrorism  conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment 
economic  political  regulatory or other developments or natural disasters could disrupt our supply chain  manufacturing capabilities or our distribution capabilities 
in addition  such developments could lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations  which could reduce our volumes  revenues and net earnings 
in certain markets  we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes 
in addition  despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct  given the breadth and scope of our international operations  we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and international partners 
we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences or to respond to consumer behavior influenced by economic downturns 
our tobacco business is subject to changes in consumer preferences  which may be influenced by local economic conditions 
to be successful  we must promote brand equity successfully  anticipate and respond to new consumer trends  develop new products and markets and broaden brand portfolios  improve productivity  and be able to protect or enhance margins through price increases 
in periods of economic uncertainty  consumers may tend to purchase lower price brands  and the volume of our premium price and mid price brands and our profitability could suffer accordingly 
such downtrading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding  communication and product differentiation 
we lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting  contraband and cross border purchases 
large quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market 
we believe that marlboro is the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand  although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity 
in addition  our revenues are reduced by contraband and legal cross border purchases 
from time to time  we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters 
investigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes  allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets  allegations of underpayment of customs duties and or excise taxes  allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors such as lights and ultra lights and allegations of unlawful advertising 
we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced  and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations 
see 
table of contents management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating results by business segment business environment governmental investigations for a description of governmental investigations to which we are subject 
we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to produce products with the potential to reduce the risk of smoking related diseases compared to conventional cigarettes 
we continue to seek ways to develop commercially viable new product technologies that may reduce the risk of smoking related diseases 
our goal is to develop products whose potential for risk reduction can be substantiated and provide adult smokers the taste  sensory experience and smoking ritual characteristics that are as close as possible to those currently provided by conventional cigarettes 
we may not succeed in these efforts 
if we do not succeed  but others do  we may be at a competitive disadvantage 
furthermore  we cannot predict whether regulators will permit the marketing of tobacco products with claims of reduced risk and harm  which could significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products 
our reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates  and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness 
we conduct our business primarily in local currency and  for purposes of financial reporting  the local currency results are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period 
during times of a strengthening us dollar  our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer us dollars 
during periods of local economic crises  foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar  reducing our margins 
actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position 
the repatriation of our foreign earnings  changes in the earnings mix  and changes in us tax laws may increase our effective tax rate 
our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls 
because we are a us holding company  our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non us subsidiaries 
under current us tax law  in general we do not pay us taxes on our foreign earnings until they are repatriated to the us as distributions from our non us subsidiaries 
these distributions may result in a residual us tax cost 
it may be advantageous to us in certain circumstances to significantly increase the amount of such distributions  which could result in a material increase in our overall effective tax rate 
additionally  the obama administration has indicated that it favors changes in us tax law that would fundamentally change how our earnings are taxed in the us if enacted and depending upon its precise terms  such legislation could increase our overall effective tax rate 
certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries ability to make payments outside the country 
our ability to grow may be limited by our inability to introduce new products  enter new markets or to improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix 
our profitability may suffer if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully  to raise prices or maintain an acceptable proportion of our sales of higher margin products and sales in higher margin geographies 
we may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships 
one element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships 
acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration  strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings 
there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms  or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings 
government mandated prices  production control programs  shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impacts of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products 
as with other agricultural commodities  the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand  and crop quality can be influenced by variations in weather patterns  including those caused by climate change 
tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls  including government mandated prices and production control programs 
changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to plant less tobacco 
any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices  quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business 

table of contents our ability to implement our strategy of attracting and retaining the best global talent may be impaired by the decreasing social acceptance of cigarette smoking 
the tobacco industry competes for talent with consumer products and other companies that enjoy greater societal acceptance 
as a result  we may be unable to attract and retain the best global talent 
the failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration by outside parties with the intent to corrupt them could result in business disruption  loss of revenue  assets or personal or other sensitive data 
we use information systems to help manage business processes  collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees  suppliers  customers and others 
some of these information systems are managed by third party service providers 
we have backup systems and business continuity plans in place  and we take care to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access 
nevertheless  failure of our systems to function as intended  or penetration of our systems by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes  could result in loss of revenue  assets or personal or other sensitive data  cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs to us 
we may be required to replace third party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources 
in certain instances  we contract with third parties to manufacture some of our products or product parts or to provide other services 
we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons  including government regulations  accordingly  our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources

table of contents item legal proceedings 
tobacco related litigation legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us  and or our subsidiaries  and or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions 
our indemnitees include distributors  licensees  and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend  as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments  if any  that may be entered against them 
pursuant to the terms of the distribution agreement between altria and pmi  pmi will indemnify altria and pm usa for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pmi or contract manufactured for pmi by pm usa  and pm usa will indemnify pmi for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by pm usa  excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for pmi 
it is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries 
an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation 
damages claimed in some of the tobacco related litigation are significant and  in certain cases in brazil  canada  israel and nigeria  range into the billions of us dollars 
the variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions  together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims  demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome 
much of the tobacco related litigation is in its early stages  and litigation is subject to uncertainty 
however  as discussed below  we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco related litigation 
we and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
at the present time  while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur  after assessing the information available to it i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco related cases  ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco related cases  and iii accordingly  no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases  if any 
legal defense costs are expensed as incurred 
it is possible that our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation 
nevertheless  although litigation is subject to uncertainty  we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe  and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases  that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us  as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts  if any 
all such cases are  and will continue to be  vigorously defended 
however  we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so 
to date  we have paid total judgments  including costs  of approximately six thousand euros in tobacco related cases
