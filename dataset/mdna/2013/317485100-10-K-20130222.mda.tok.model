item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of independent  technology enabled portfolio management  investment advice and retirement income services primarily to participants in employer sponsored defined contribution retirement plans  such as k plans 
we use our proprietary advice technology platform to provide our services to millions of investors on a cost efficient basis 
our business model is based primarily on workplace delivery of our services  where we target three key constituencies in the retirement plan market plan participants  plan sponsors and plan providers 
revenue we generate revenue primarily from management fees on assets under management  or aum  as well as from platform fees  by providing portfolio management services  investment advice and retirement income services primarily to plan participants of employer sponsored retirement plans 
we maintain two types of relationships with retirement plan providers 
in direct advisory relationships  we are the primary advisor and a plan fiduciary 
in subadvisory relationships  the plan provider or its affiliate is the primary advisor and plan fiduciary  and we act in a subadvisory capacity 
professional management we derive professional management revenue from member fees paid by or on behalf of plan participants who are enrolled in our professional management service for the management of their account assets 
our professional management service is a discretionary investment management service that includes retirement income services  a retirement plan analyzing investments  contribution rate and projected retirement income  a retirement checkup designed to help plan participants develop a strategy for closing the gap  if any  between the participant s retirement goal and current retirement income forecast and retirement income services 
income is a feature of our professional management service that provides retirement income for k participants by providing discretionary portfolio management with an income objective and steady monthly payments from their k accounts during retirement 
the services are generally made available to plan participants in a k plan by written agreements with the plan provider  plan sponsor and the plan participant 
our arrangements with customers generally provide for member fees based on the value of assets we manage for plan participants and are generally payable quarterly in arrears 
the majority of our member fees across both advisory and subadvisory relationships are calculated on a monthly basis  as the product of member fee rates and the value of aum at or near the end of each month for members 
in general  we expect this methodology to reduce the impact of financial market volatility on our professional management revenue  although this methodology may result in lower member fees if the financial markets are down when member fees are calculated  even if the market had performed well earlier in the month or the quarter 

table of contents pursuant to the contracts with our members  we calculate our member fees based on the asset amounts in data files as received directly from the plan providers  with no judgments or estimates on our part 
none of our member fees are based on investment performance or other incentive arrangements 
our fees generally are based on aum  which is influenced by market performance 
our fees are not based on a share of the capital gains or appreciation in a member s account 
in some cases  our member fees may adjust downward based on overall participant or aum enrollment performance milestones over time 
our member fees are determined by the value of the assets in the member s account at the specified dates and are recognized as the services are performed 
prior to fiscal year  we saw an increase in professional management revenue in the fourth quarter due to the fee structure with one of our subadvisory plan providers  under which we recognized the difference between earned revenue and annual minimum contractual revenue in the fourth quarter 
effective january  we no longer see this fourth quarter trend as the fee structure for this particular plan provider has been renegotiated to provide an earned revenue fee structure that eliminates the annual minimum contractual revenue provision 
as a result  the earned revenue from this plan provider could vary substantially with market performance and net enrollment  as is the case with professional management revenue from our other plan providers 
historically  we have seen a general preference from plan sponsors to commence campaigns in the second and third quarters of the year and we expect this trend to continue 
in order to encourage enrollment into our professional management service  we use a variety of promotional techniques  some of which can potentially impact the amount of revenue recognized  the timing of revenue recognition or both 
we would generally expect our professional management revenue to continue to increase as a percentage of overall revenue  which will cause our revenue to become increasingly more sensitive to market performance 
enrollment metrics we measure enrollment in our professional management service by members as a percentage of eligible plan participants and by aum as a percentage of assets under contract  or auc  in each case across all plans where the professional management service is available for enrollment  including plans where enrollment campaigns are not yet concluded or have not commenced 
aum is defined as the amount of retirement plan assets that we manage as part of our professional management service 
our aum is the value of assets under management as reported by plan providers at or near the end of each month or quarter 
our members are the plan participants who are enrolled in our professional management service as reported by plan providers at or near the end of each month or quarter 
auc is defined as the amount of assets in retirement plans under contract for which the professional management service has been made available to eligible participants 
our auc and eligible participants do not include assets or participants in plans where we have signed contracts but for which we have not yet made the professional management service available 
eligible participants and assets under contract are reported by plan providers with varying frequency and at different points in time  and is not always updated or marked to market 
if markets have declined since the reporting date  or if assets have left the plan  our auc may be overstated 
if markets have risen since the reporting date  or if assets have been added to the plan  our auc may be understated 
some plan participants may not be eligible for our services due to plan sponsor limitations on employees treated as insiders for purposes of securities laws or other characteristics of the plan participant 
certain securities within a plan participant s account may be ineligible for management by us  such as employer stock subject to trading restrictions  and we do not manage or charge a fee for that portion of the account 
in both of these circumstances  assets of the relevant participants may be included in auc but cannot be converted to aum 
we believe that auc can be a useful indicator of the additional plan assets available for enrollment efforts that  if successful  would result in these assets becoming aum 
we believe that total eligible participants provides a useful approximation of the number of participants available for enrollment into the professional management service 

table of contents as of december   we had approximately billion of auc and million eligible plan participants in plans for which the professional management service is available  which includes approximately billion of auc and  eligible plan participants in plans for which income has been made available to participants 
in addition to measuring enrollment in all plans where the professional management service is available  we measure enrollment in plans where the professional management service has been available for at least months and in plans where it has been available for at least months 
all plans as of december  members as a percentage of eligible participants aum as a percentage of auc professional management available professional management available months or more professional management available months or more we receive aum data from plan providers at or near the end of each quarter and auc data from plan providers at various points in time  neither of which is marked to market as of quarter end 
in quarters with significant volatility  especially near the end of the quarter  the auc data we receive from plan providers can be significantly different than market values as of quarter end 
as of december   we performed a calculation to estimate the marked to market asset enrollment rate as of december   which we believe was approximately where professional management is available  approximately where professional management has been available for months or more and approximately where professional management has been available for months or more 
as of december   the approximate aggregate style exposure of the portfolios we managed was as follows cash bonds domestic equity international equity total we estimate the aggregate percentage of equity exposures have ranged from a low of approximately to a high of approximately since we began managing assets on a discretionary basis in september these percentages can be affected by the asset exposures of the overall market portfolio  the demographics of our member population including the adoption of income  the number of members who have told us that they want to assume greater or lesser investment risk  and  to a lesser extent given the amount of assets we have under management  the proportion of our members for whom we have completed the transition from their initial portfolio 

table of contents changes in aum the following table illustrates estimated changes in our aum over the last four quarters q q q q aum  beginning of period new enrollment voluntary cancellations involuntary cancellations contributions market movement and other aum  end of period the aggregate amount of assets under management  at the time of enrollment  of new members who enrolled in our professional management service within the period 
we receive k account balances for each member at least weekly  including k account balances for new members 
accordingly  we are able to capture the k account balances within a week of enrollment for any given new member 
the aggregate amount of assets  at the time of cancellation  for voluntary cancellations from the professional management service within the period 
members may cancel at any time without any requirement to provide advance notice 
our quarter end aum excludes the assets of any account cancelled by a member prior to the end of the last day of the quarter 
we can quantify this amount for any period by retrieving the account value from the last file received during the week prior to cancellation 
the aggregate amount of assets  as of the last available positive account balance  for involuntary cancellations occurring when the member s k plan account balance has been reduced to zero or when the cancellation of a plan sponsor contract for the professional management service has become effective within the period 
plan sponsors may cancel their contract for the provision of professional management services to the plan participants upon specified notice or without notice for fiduciary reasons or breach of contract 
if a plan sponsor has provided advance notice of cancellation of the plan sponsor contract  however  the aum for members of that plan sponsor is included in our aum until the effective date of the cancellation  after which it is no longer part of our aum 
if a member s account value falls to zero  either upon the effective date of a sponsor cancellation or the member transferring the entire account balance  we treat the account as an involuntary cancellation and quantify the amount for any period by retrieving the account value from the last file received with a positive balance 
involuntary member cancellations due to the effective date of a plan sponsor cancellation occurring between january  and january  would cause the aum that was reported as of december  to be reduced by 
employer and employee contributions are estimated each quarter from annual contribution rates based on data received from plan providers or plan sponsors 
typically  we receive data from plan providers or plan sponsors via weekly member files  allowing us to estimate contributions for those members for whom we have received this data 
for the last four quarters  the weekly member files contained annual contribution rates  employer matching and salary levels for a subset of our total members  representing approximately of our overall aum 
the average contribution rate is calculated using this data and extrapolated to approximate of employee and employer contributions for our overall aum 
the data presented in the table above differs from data provided in filings prior to september   as the prior contributions data reported represented only that subset of members for whom we received salary data 
other factors affecting assets under management include estimated market movement  plan administrative fees  participant loans and hardship withdrawals  and timing differences 
we cannot separately quantify the impact of the other factors contained in this line item as the information we receive from the plan providers does not separately identify these transactions or the changes in balances due to market movement 
we would expect that market movement would typically represent the most substantial portion of this line item in a given quarter 

table of contents our aum increases or decreases based on several factors 
aum can increase due to market performance  by the addition of new assets as participants enroll into our professional management service  both at existing sponsors as well as at new sponsors where the services have been made available  and by the addition of new assets from employee and employer contributions into their k accounts 
aum can decrease due to market performance and by the reduction of assets as a result of members terminating their membership  members rolling their assets out of the retirement plan  and sponsors canceling the professional management service 
historically  member cancellation rates have typically increased during periods where there has been a significant decline in stock market performance 
in addition  member cancellation rates are typically the highest in the three and six months immediately following the completion of a given promotional campaign  and certain types of promotional techniques may result in higher than average cancellation rates at the end of the promotional period 
a substantial portion of the assets we manage is invested in equity securities  the market prices of which can vary substantially based on changes in economic conditions 
an additional portion is invested in fixed income securities  which will generally have lower volatility than the equity market 
therefore  while any changes in equity market performance would significantly affect the value of our aum  particularly for the aum invested in equity securities  such changes would typically result in lower volatility for our aum than the volatility of the equity market as a whole 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the value of our aum  changes in fixed income or equity market performance could significantly affect the amount of revenue in a given period 
if any of these factors reduces our aum  the amount of member fees we would earn for managing those assets would decline  which in turn could negatively impact our revenue 
platform 
we derive platform revenue from recurring  subscription based platform fees for access to either our full suite of services  including professional management  online advice service  and retirement evaluation  or to our legacy online advice service only  and to a lesser extent  from setup fees 
online advice is a nondiscretionary internet based investment advisory service  which includes features such as recommendations among the investment alternatives available in the employer sponsored retirement plan  a summary of the current value of the plan account  a forecast of how much the plan account investments might be worth at retirement  whether a change is recommended to the contribution rate  risk and diversification and or unrestricted employer stock holdings  and a projection of how much the participant may spend at retirement 
plan participants may use the service as frequently as they choose to monitor progress toward their financial goals  receive forecasts and investment recommendations and access educational content at our website 
the arrangements generally provide for our fees to be paid by the plan sponsor  plan provider or the retirement plan itself  depending on the plan structure 
platform revenue is generally paid annually or quarterly in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period beginning after the completion of customer setup and data connectivity 
setup fees are recognized ratably over the estimated average period of a sponsor relationship  which for accounting purposes is estimated to be five years 
other revenue 
other revenue includes reimbursement for a portion of marketing and member materials from certain subadvisory relationships and reimbursement for providing personal statements to participants from a limited number of plan sponsors 
the costs associated with these reimbursed print fulfillment materials are expensed to cost of revenue as incurred 
in prior periods  a small portion of other revenue has been derived from a defined benefit consulting business which was discontinued as of december  costs and expenses employee compensation and related expenses represent our largest expense and includes wages expense  cash incentive compensation expense  benefits expenses  employer payroll tax expense and non cash stock based compensation expense 
our cash incentive compensation plan is based  in part  on achieving pre determined annual corporate financial objectives and may result in an increased current period expense while the anticipated revenue benefits associated with the achievement of such corporate financial objectives may be realized in future periods 
we allocate compensation and other related expenses including non cash stock based compensation to 
table of contents our cost of revenue  research and development  sales and marketing  general and administrative as well as amortization of internal use software expense categories 
while we expect our headcount to increase over time  we believe that the economies of scale in our business model can allow us to grow our compensation and related expenses at a lower rate than revenue 
we anticipate granting equity awards to board members and certain of our employees each year  with the most significant events typically occurring in the first and fourth quarters  that may result in significant non cash stock based compensation expense 
we anticipate providing annual compensation increases to certain of our employees each year  typically in the second quarter  that may result in an increase primarily to wages expense 
other costs and expenses include the costs of fees paid to plan providers related to the exchange of plan and plan participant data as well as implementing our transaction instructions for member accounts  printed marketing and member materials and postage  consulting and professional service expenses  facilities expenses  and amortization and depreciation for hardware and software purchases and support 
the following summarizes our cost of revenue and certain significant operating expenses cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan participant data  printed materials fulfillment costs for certain subadvisory relationships for which a portion are reimbursed  printed member materials  and employee related costs for technical operations  implementations  operations  advisor call center operations and portfolio management 
costs in this area are related primarily to payments to third parties  employee compensation and related expenses  and purchased materials 
costs for connectivity to plan and plan participant data are expected to increase proportionally with our professional management revenue  as well as by contractual increases in plan provider fees as a result of achieving certain milestones 
the expenses included in cost of revenue are shared across the different revenue categories  and we are not able to meaningfully allocate such costs between separate categories of revenue 
consequently  all costs and expenses applicable to our revenue are included in the category cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
amortization of internal use software  a portion of which relates to our cost of revenue  is not included in cost of revenue but is reflected as a separate line item in our statement of income 
research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with defining and specifying new features and ongoing enhancement to our advice engines and other aspects of our service offerings  financial research  quality assurance  related administration and other costs that do not qualify for capitalization 
costs in this area are related primarily to employee compensation for our investment research  product development and engineering personnel and associated expenses and  to a lesser extent  external consulting expenses  which relate primarily to support and maintenance of our existing services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense includes costs associated with provider and sponsor relationship management  provider and sponsor marketing  direct sales  product marketing  public relations and printing of and postage for marketing materials for direct advisory relationships including amortization of direct response advertising 
costs in this area are related primarily to employee compensation for sales and marketing personnel and related expenses  and also include commissions  printed materials and general marketing programs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense includes costs for finance  accounting  legal  compliance and administration 
costs in this area include employee compensation and related expenses and fees for consulting and professional services 
we have incurred and we expect that we will continue to incur expenses as a result of becoming a public company for  among other things  sec reporting and compliance  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  director fees  insurance  and other similar expenses 
amortization of internal use software 
amortization of internal use software expense includes engineering costs associated with enhancing our advisory service platform and developing internal 
table of contents systems for tracking member data  including aum  member cancellations and other related member statistics 
associated direct development costs are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over the estimated lives  typically three to five years  of the underlying technology 
costs in this area include employee compensation and related expenses  and fees for external consulting services 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
we have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period 
however  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results  as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
direct response advertising 
effective july   we commenced capitalization of advertising costs associated with direct advisory active enrollment campaigns  which caused a significant amount of costs to be capitalized for the years ended december   and our advertising costs consist primarily of print materials associated with new member solicitations 
advertising costs that do not qualify as direct response advertising are expensed to sales and marketing at the first time the advertisement takes place 
effective july   we commenced capitalization of advertising costs associated with direct advisory active enrollment campaigns on a prospective basis as it was then determined that we had sufficient and verifiable historical patterns over a reasonable period to demonstrate probable future benefits of such campaigns 
direct response advertising costs are capitalized only if the primary purpose of the advertising is to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and the direct response advertising results in probable future benefits 
advertising costs relating to passive enrollment campaigns and other general marketing materials sent to participants do not qualify as direct response advertising and are expensed to sales and marketing in the period the advertising activities first take place 
print fulfillment costs relating to subadvisory campaigns do not qualify as direct response advertising and are expensed to cost of revenue in the period in which the expenses were incurred 
advertising costs associated with direct advisory active enrollment campaigns that result in probable future benefits qualify for capitalization as direct response advertising 
the capitalized costs are amortized over the period over which the future benefits are expected to be received 
because of how we earn revenue from our professional management service  demonstrating that the direct response advertising related to our direct advisory active enrollment campaigns results in probable future benefits requires us to make several assumptions about the average period of probable future benefits  the gross revenue we will earn and costs we will incur as a result of each campaign 
we have developed forecasting methodologies that have a degree of reliability sufficient to reasonably estimate the future gross revenue stream associated with a given campaign 
the significant estimates and judgments we use in our forecasting methodologies include average period of probable future benefits  change in aum due to market performance  aum cancellation rates  net contribution rates and estimated enrollment results for campaigns that have not yet been completed 
we have estimated our period of probable future benefits by considering both the historical retention rate of our members while not exceeding the number of years over which we can accurately forecast future net revenues 
the change in aum due to market performance is an estimate of future stock market performance and its estimated relative effect on our aum 
aum cancellation rate is defined as the rate at which assets will cancel out of the professional management program due to voluntary member terminations 
a voluntary member termination is when a member contacts financial engines and terminates his or her membership in the professional management service 
involuntary cancellations such as sponsor and employee terminations or rollovers are captured in the net contribution rate 
net contribution rate is 
table of contents defined as the net amount assets will increase as a result of new contributions in to the k plan less the amount assets will decrease as a result of disbursements from the k plan  as a result of involuntary cancellations 
we have estimated aum cancellation and contribution rates by analyzing their respective historical rates 
we currently have assumed a probable period of future benefits of three years  no change in aum due to market performance and a zero net contribution rate for the purpose of calculating estimated gross revenue 
the realizability of the amounts of direct response advertising reported as assets are evaluated at each balance sheet date by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets on a cost pool by cost pool basis to the probable remaining future net revenues expected to result directly from such advertising 
as of december   million of advertising costs associated with direct advisory active choice enrollment campaigns were reported as assets 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of direct response advertising costs 
advertising expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which direct response advertising amortization was million  million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  impairments to direct response advertising were immaterial 
the table below evaluates the sensitivity of two of our most significant estimates  namely average period of probable future benefits and assumed change in our aum due to market performance  on the realizability of net capitalized direct response advertising costs as of december  this sensitivity analysis considered all historic and current year campaigns with a net capitalized balance as of december  under our current assumptions of a three year average period of probable future benefits and change in aum due to market performance per year 
the sensitivity table indicates the additional expense charges that would have been recorded as of december  if  effective january   we had assumed different levels of change in aum due to market performance and assumed an estimated period of probable benefits other than years 
direct response advertising sensitivity analysis additional expense impairments to be recognized assumed change in aum due to market performance in thousands average period of probable future benefits year years years years years any comparable percentage change to aum due to market performance  net contribution rate and aum cancellation rate would have the same relative impact on the sensitivity analysis as they all directly impact member aum 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions 
we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely 
table of contents than not 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as a result  we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when  despite the belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
prior to september   we maintained a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets  since the likelihood of the realization of those assets had not become more likely than not 
we continually evaluate additional facts representing both positive and negative evidence in the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets  including scheduling of deferred tax liabilities and projected income from operating activities 
the underlying assumptions we use in forecasting future taxable income require significant judgment and take into account all available evidence  including past operating results and our recent performance 
in forecasting future taxable income we did not assume any gains as a result of market performance on our aum or from the addition of new markets and services we may be considering 
nor did we incorporate any marked improvement in our historical enrollment rates  voluntary cancellation rates or involuntary cancellation rates 
historical differences between forecast and actual taxable profits have not resulted in material adjustments to the recognition of our deferred tax assets 
we are not relying on tax planning strategies to support the realization of our deferred tax assets 
rather  we are relying primarily on future taxable income to support the realizability of our deferred tax assets and to a much lesser degree through the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences 
furthermore  our deferred tax liabilities are of the same character and jurisdiction as the temporary differences giving rise to our deferred tax assets and will reverse in similar periods as the temporary differences giving rise to our deferred tax assets 
effective september   we believed that sufficient positive evidence existed from historical operations and future income projections to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would fully realize our federal deferred tax assets and to partially realize our state of california deferred tax assets 
therefore  we released valuation allowances of million during the year ended december  we also released an additional portion of our state of california deferred tax assets totaling million during the year ended december  we continue to apply a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in the amount of million relating to the state of california as it is not more likely than not that we will be able to realize these assets prior to their expiration 
as of december   the amount of pre tax income we need to generate in future years in order to realize our deferred tax assets is approximately million and million with respect to approximately million of federal related deferred tax assets and million of state related net deferred tax assets  respectively 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire through as of december   we had research credit carryforwards for federal and state of california income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future income taxes  which are based on estimates of future realizability 
the federal research credit carryforwards expire through the state of california research credit carries forward indefinitely 
the federal research and development credit expired on december  on january   the american taxpayer relief act of was signed into law 
under this act  the federal research and development credit was retroactively extended 
table of contents for amounts paid or incurred after december  and before january  the effects of these changes in the tax law will result in a tax benefit which will be recognized in the first quarter of  which is the quarter in which the law was enacted 
all tax years since inception are open and may be subject to examination in one or more jurisdictions 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense for stock option awards is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the determination of the fair value of stock based option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include volatility  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends over the expected term of the awards 
year ended december  expected life in years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield we use the simplified method in developing an estimate of expected term of stock options as we expect our employee exercise behavior to change resulting from our initial public offering 
we base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we estimate expected volatility based on a combination of the historical and implied volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group based on industry and market capitalization data 
in february  the board of directors declared our first quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share and we anticipate paying quarterly cash dividends in the future 
for periods through december   we did not declare or issue dividends and therefore the expected dividend yield was zero 
effective the first quarter of  the dividend yield will include the anticipated dividends to be paid in future periods 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  future stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth our results of operations 
the period to period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results 
comparison of the years ended december  and year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease amount as a percentage of revenue in thousands  except percentages revenue professional management platform other total revenue costs and expenses cost of revenue exclusive of amortization of internal use software research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of internal use software total costs and expenses income from operations interest income expense other income n a income before income tax expense income tax expense net income revenue total revenue increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to growth in professional management revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  professional management revenue and platform revenue comprised and  respectively  of total revenue for the year ended december  professional management revenue professional management revenue increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in professional management revenue for the year ended december  was due primarily to an increase in the average monthly total aum used to calculate fees from approximately billion for the year ended december  to approximately billion for the year ended december  this increase in average monthly total aum was driven primarily by increased net enrollment resulting from marketing campaigns and other ongoing member acquisitions  as well as contributions and market appreciation 

table of contents effective january  due to a revised agreement with one of our subadvisory plan providers  an annual minimum contractual revenue provision was eliminated  which historically resulted in an increase in professional management revenue in the fourth quarter when we recognized the difference between earned revenue and annual minimum contractual revenue 
this contract was also renegotiated to provide asset based revenue  which can vary substantially with market performance  instead of annual minimum contractual revenue 
as a result  for the year ended december   this revised contract resulted in increased annual revenue compared to the year ended december  due primarily to contributions and market appreciation 
platform revenue platform revenue decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to a few sponsor terminations  which resulted mainly from an effort to unify all sponsors onto our full service platform 
other revenue other revenue decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in other revenue for the year ended december  was due primarily to a decrease in reimbursable printed fulfillment materials from certain subadvisory relationships 
costs and expenses costs and expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to a million increase in cost of revenue  exclusive of amortization of internal use software  a million increase in research and development expense  a million increase in sales and marketing expense  a million increase in general and administrative expense and a million increase in amortization of internal use software for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  across functional areas  wages  benefits and payroll taxes increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to headcount growth and annual compensation increases effective april  we expect wages  benefits and payroll tax expense to continue to increase for the year ended december  due to planned headcount growth and annual compensation increases 
rent expense  which is included in allocated overhead expenses  increased across all functional areas for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to the commencement of our lease contract for our new headquarters facilities 
for the year ended december   we incurred increased rent expense beginning april  associated with our new headquarters facility 
in addition  we incurred rent expense through our lease termination date of august  associated with our prior headquarters facility lease 
non cash stock based compensation expense increased across all functional areas due primarily to equity awards granted to certain of our existing employees in mid november substantially all of these grants will vest over four years under the graded vesting attribution method  resulting in greater amounts of compensation expense recognized in earlier periods of the grants with declining amounts recognized in later periods 
the aggregate value of the mid november awards was million 
we estimate these mid november equity grants will incur approximately million of non cash stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for the year ended december  in february  the board of directors amended and restated the stock incentive plan the updated stock incentive plan and approved the long term incentive program the ltip thereunder 
under the ltip  we may grant performance stock unit psu awards based on objective performance criteria pre 
table of contents established by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
in march  the compensation committee intends to grant psus under the ltip subject to stockholder approval of the updated stock incentive plan at the annual meeting of stockholders in may further details on the updated stock incentive plan and the ltip will be presented in the proxy statement 
assuming we obtain stockholder approval  the psus will have an expense value  measured in may but estimated as of the date of this filing  of approximately million assuming target achievement 
we plan to update the total expense value of psus granted in our june  form q filing based on actual data as of the measurement date in may we would recognize non cash stock based compensation expense under the graded vesting attribution method 
each psu award consists of two vesting cliffs  with sixty percent eligible to vest on december  and forty percent eligible to vest on december  the expense associated with each vesting cliff will be straight lined over its respective period beginning in may  which will result in greater amounts of non cash stock based compensation expense recognized in earlier periods of the grants with declining amounts recognized in later periods 
depending on performance against the target metrics  vesting will be between and of target value for each of the vesting cliffs and the expense will be reviewed and adjusted based on forecasts at the end of each balance sheet period 
assuming target achievement  we estimate the ltip equity grants  measured in may but estimated as of the date of this filing  will incur approximately million of non cash stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for the year ended december  both of the estimates presented above for the november and ltip stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   is in addition to the amortization of both previously and subsequently granted stock awards  including other awards expected to be granted in  utilizing the graded vesting attribution method

quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly condensed consolidated statements of income data for the eight quarters ended december  the data have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes  and you should read the following tables together with such financial statements 
the quarterly results of operations include all necessary adjustments  consisting of only normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data 
results of interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year and are not necessarily indicative of future results 
our professional management revenue generally increased sequentially in each of the quarters presented as a result of aum growth driven primarily by net new enrollment resulting from marketing campaigns and other ongoing member acquisitions  market appreciation and contributions 
platform revenue has generally been flat in recent quarters 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the fee structure with one of our plan providers under which we recognized the difference between earned revenue and minimum contractual revenue in the fourth quarter  both professional management and platform revenue increased 
effective january  the fee structure for this plan provider has been renegotiated to provide an earned revenue fee structure that eliminates the annual minimum contractual revenue provision and fourth quarter effect 
total costs and expenses have fluctuated both in absolute dollars and percentage of revenue from quarter to quarter due primarily to fees paid to plan providers for connectivity to plan and plan participant data  printed materials costs related to participant and member materials  non cash stock based compensation expenses  employee related expenses related to headcount growth and compensation increases and increased facilities

adjusted net income represents net income before non cash stock based compensation expense  net of tax and certain other items such as the income tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances  if applicable for the period 
adjusted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average of dilutive common share equivalents outstanding 
for all periods prior to fiscal year  the dilutive common share equivalents outstanding also include on a non weighted basis the conversion of all preferred stock to common stock  the shares associated with the stock dividend and the shares sold in the initial public offering 
this differs from the weighted average diluted shares outstanding used for purposes of calculating gaap earnings per share 
our management uses adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as measures of operating performance  for planning purposes including the preparation of annual budgets  to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business  to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance 
adjusted ebitda  among other factors  was used for the year ended december  and will be used for the year ended december  when determining cash incentive compensation for employees  including management 
we also present adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as supplemental performance measures because we believe that these measures provide our board of directors  management and investors with additional information to measure our performance 
adjusted ebitda provides comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in the age and book depreciation of fixed assets affecting relative depreciation expense and amortization of internal use software  direct response advertising and commissions  and changes in interest expense and interest income that are influenced by capital structure decisions and capital market conditions 
management also believes it is useful to exclude non cash 
table of contents stock based compensation expense from adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share because non cash equity grants made at a certain price and point in time  as well as certain other items such as the income tax benefit from the release of valuation allowances  do not necessarily reflect how our business is performing at any particular time 
adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  earnings per share or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our profitability or liquidity 
we understand that  although adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are frequently used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of companies  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share have limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider them in isolation  or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
in particular you should consider adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share do not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share do not reflect the non cash component of employee compensation  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized generally will have to be replaced in the future by payment of cash  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 
given the limitations associated with using adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share  these financial measures should be considered in conjunction with our financial statements presented in accordance with gaap and the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to the most directly comparable gaap measure  net income 
further  management also reviews gaap measures and evaluates individual measures that are not included in adjusted ebitda  such as our level of capital expenditures  equity issuance and interest expense  among other measures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as an investment manager for investor accounts for which we provide portfolio management services 
for the year ended december   of our revenue was derived from fees based on the market value of aum compared to for the year ended december  this percentage increased due primarily to a revised agreement with one of our subadvisory plan providers  which increased the amount of fees based on the market value of aum 
in general  we expect the percentage of revenue that is derived from fees based on the market value of aum to increase over time 
a substantial portion of the assets we manage is invested in equity securities  the market prices of which can vary substantially based on changes in economic conditions 
an additional portion is invested in fixed income securities  which will generally have lower volatility than the equity market 
therefore  while any changes in equity market performance would significantly affect the value of our aum  particularly for the aum invested in equity securities  such changes would typically result in lower volatility for our aum than the volatility of the equity market as a whole 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the value of our aum  any changes in fixed income or equity market performance would significantly affect the amount of revenue in a given period 
if any of these factors reduces our aum  the amount of member fees we would earn for managing those assets would decline  which in turn could negatively impact our revenue
