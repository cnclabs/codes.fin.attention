our management continues to review our existing lines of business and service offerings to determine how those lines of business and service offerings assist with our focus on the delivery of communications services and meeting our financial objectives 
this exercise takes place in the ordinary course of our business and with respect to integration activities 
to the extent that certain lines of business or service offerings are not considered to be compatible with the delivery of communications services or with obtaining our financial objectives  we may exit those lines of business or stop offering those services in part or in whole 
our distribution strategy our customers generally include the following types of customers enterprises  content  government and wholesale 
our enterprise customers include mid to large size enterprises that purchase communications services on a regional or local basis  large multinational customers  large enterprises that purchase communications services in a manner similar to carriers  portals and large search enterprises  regional service providers  systems integrators  and software service providers 
our content customers comprise subgroups of customers including digital entertainment  such as providers of online gaming  social networking providers  technology companies that enable digital advertising and digital ad agencies  and companies that provide video over the internet  media and entertainment  such as media conglomerates  programmers  studios and production companies  and broadcast station ownership groups  and sports teams professional and college  and stadiums and venues

the specific elements that we use depend upon the nature of the customers that are being targeted 

table of contents for business customers and other customers that make communications purchasing decisions on a local or regional basis  we target them with our direct sales force 
smaller opportunities are serviced by an inside or call center based sales force generally selling pre defined bundles of services 
the customers that we target with this combination are generally those in the mid market  small regional service providers  some educational institutions and some governmental entities 
we also complement our direct and inside sales forces that targets these customers with an indirect sales channel of third party agents and from time to time systems integrators 
we are seeking to expand our indirect sales channel to include expanded relationships with systems integrators 
we have worked with systems integrators to provide services to those companies  which the system integrator then bundles into the services that it is providing to the ultimate end user customer 
we are looking to apply this expanded relationship to both large and mid market enterprise customers

for the year ended december   our top ten communications customers represented approximately of our total communications revenue 
for a discussion of certain geographic information regarding how we manage our business  please see the discussion under item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing later in this form k 
our communications network our network is an advanced  international  facilities based communications network 
we primarily provide services over our own facilities 
as of december   our network encompasses approximately  intercity route miles in north america  europe and latin america  metropolitan fiber networks in approximately markets containing approximately  route miles  approximately eight million square feet of gateway and transmission facilities in north america  europe and latin america  approximately colocation and data center facilities globally  approximately  route miles of subsea optical fiber cable systems  and more than countries in service around the world 
terrestrial intercity networks 
our intercity network covers approximately  route miles in north america   route miles in europe  and  route miles in latin america as of december  while the aggregate number of route miles in our network may not reduce over time  we may eliminate specific routes or duplicate routes as we continue to look at opportunities to optimize our cost structure and remove unnecessary cost 
our intercity network generally includes the following characteristics optical fiber strands designed to accommodate dense wave division multiplexing  or dwdm  transmission technology 
our optical fiber strands are designed to accommodate dwdm technology 
we believe that the installation of newer optical fibers will allow a combination of greater wavelengths of light per strand  higher transmission speeds and longer physical spacing between network 
table of contents electronics 
we also believe that each new generation of optical fiber will allow increases in the performance of these network design aspects and will therefore enable lower unit costs 
high speed intercity dwdm equipment 
our high speed intercity dwdm equipment provides high quality  reliable and cost effective transmission across our fiber backbone 
we are continually evaluating advancements in technology that will enable us to scale  lower our cost and provide higher speed services over our intercity network 
we believe that the market will continue to move toward ethernet based services and higher speed interfaces 
through our technology evaluations we believe that we have positioned ourselves to be able to deliver these capabilities for both our own ip network needs as well as those of our customers 
open  non proprietary hardware and software interfaces 
our intercity network is designed to maximize the use of open  non proprietary hardware and software interfaces to allow less costly upgrades as hardware and software technology improves 
local market infrastructure 
our local facilities include fiber optic metropolitan networks connecting our intercity network and gateways to buildings housing communications intensive end users  enterprise customers and traffic aggregation points including ilec and clec central offices  long distance carrier points of presence or pops  cable head ends  wireless providers facilities and internet peering and transit facilities 
our high fiber count metropolitan networks allow us to extend our services directly to our customers locations at low costs  because the availability of this network infrastructure does not require extensive multiplexing equipment to reach a customer location  which is required in ordinary fiber constrained metropolitan networks 
as of december   we had approximately   and  route miles of metropolitan fiber networks in north america  europe and latin america  respectively  and had operational  facilities based  local metropolitan networks in  and markets in north america  europe and latin america  respectively 
we operate approximately eight million square feet of space for our gateway and transmission facilities 
our initial gateway facilities were designed to house local sales staff  operational staff  our transmission and internet protocol routing  content delivery networks and voice switching facilities and technical space to accommodate colocation services that is  the colocation of equipment by high volume level customers  in an environmentally controlled  secure site with direct access to level s network generally through dual  fault tolerant connections 
as of december   we had more than colocation facilities in north america  more than colocation facilities in europe  and colocation facilities in latin america 
we also operate data center facilities in latin america  europe and north america that are designed to support hosting services together with our broadband services and advanced value added solutions 
most of these facilities offer a complete set of data center services ranging from housing and hosting  to more complex managed solutions  including disaster recovery  applications management  business continuity  and security services to manage mission critical applications 
transoceanic networks 
we own a number of subsea fiber optic cable systems  including atlantic crossing ac  atlantic crossing ac  mid atlantic crossing mac  south american crossing sac  pan american crossing pac and an approximately route mile system connecting the uk and ireland 
ac and ac link our european network to our north american intercity network and each of ac and ac consists of four fiber strand pairs 
mac provides a strategic gateway between the eastern seaboard of the us and our latin america assets  a route that is experiencing acute demand growth and increasing capacity scarcity 
sac connects major markets throughout latin america and is one of only two sub sea systems currently in operation that circumnavigates the majority of south america 
pac is integrated with a  mile terrestrial ring route including associated backhaul within mexico  as well as an extension to costa rica in we also own capacity in the tat transatlantic cable system 
in addition  we purchased gigabits of transatlantic capacity from apollo submarine cable system ltd 
we have acquired an additional one terabit of capacity on the apollo south cable system  which will be drawn down over a multi year period 
we also are an owner of the japan us  and china us cable systems  an indefeasible right of use  or iru  holder on the southern 
table of contents cross cable system extending from australia to california  as well as an owner of the americas ii cable extending from florida to brazil  and an iru holder on the arcos system in the caribbean 
in addition  we own capacity on the reliance globacom transatlantic system flag atlantic and capacity on the hibernia transatlantic cable system 
our patent portfolio through acquisitions and through our own research and development  we have approximately patents and patent applications in the united states and around the world  as of december  our patent portfolio includes patents covering technologies ranging from data and voice services to content distribution to transmission and networking equipment 
in addition to the patents and patent applications we own  we have received licenses to patents held by others  including through a cross license agreement with ibm entered into in december  giving us access to technology covered by ibm approximately at that time  patents covering many technologies relevant to our business 
while patents give us the right to prevent others  particularly competitors  from using our proprietary technologies  patent licenses give us the freedom to operate our business without the risk of interruption from the holder of the patent that has been licensed to us 
we use our patent portfolio in a number of ways 
first  developing or acquiring technologies and receiving the legal right to preclude others from using them may give us a competitive advantage 
second  the breadth and depth of our patent portfolio may deter others  particularly telecommunications operators  from bringing patent infringement claims against us for fear of counter claim by us 
most of the patent infringement suits brought against us to date have been initiated by patent holding companies who do not operate telecommunications businesses and who are less likely to be subject to a counter claim of infringement by us 
finally  the extensiveness of our patent portfolio gives us the option to cross license with others having similarly broad portfolios on terms acceptable to us  mitigating the risk that others will wish to assert patent infringement claims against us 
we will continue to file new patent applications as we enhance and develop products and services  we will continue to seek opportunities to expand our patent portfolio through strategic acquisitions and licensing and we will continue to appropriately enforce our patents against infringement by others 
our content acquisition and delivery networks we believe that our vyvx and content distribution network  or cdn  assets combined with our other network infrastructure provide us with a competitive advantage in the content acquisition and distribution business 
this belief is based on several factors 
network scale 
because we are a facilities based provider  we can generally increase capacity to meet the needs of content providers more quickly than other cdn providers that do not own underlying network assets 
network reach 
we believe our customers content reaches global internet destinations using an average number of hops that are fewer than with most other cdn providers  which enables our customers to easily reach their audiences and provide a better viewing experience 
the fewer number of hops required to reach internet destinations serves to reduce latency and jitter 
low cost position 
because we own or control much of the underlying  end to end network infrastructure required to deliver our cdn services  we believe that we are positioned to offer cost advantages to our customers 
by moving content at scale  our customers can take advantage of lower unit costs for bandwidth  colocation  servers and disk space 
network performance 
because we own or control much of the underlying network infrastructure  we believe that we are positioned to optimize end user performance as we are the operators of that infrastructure 

table of contents cdn applications 
there are an increasing number of applications for cdn  across many types of customers  particularly internet centric businesses and those that desire to accommodate increasingly larger file sizes for transmission over the internet 
the media and entertainment industries use cdn services to provide on demand streaming and live streaming 
social networking businesses require cdn to provide their customers with fast reliable music and video downloads 
likewise  through the use of cdn  software companies are able to provide software downloads for their customers 
online retailers and advertisers use cdn services to provide images and to download advertisements 
online gaming companies provide game downloads  applications updates and delivery of demos and trailers through cdn 
content acquisition and distribution services architecture 
cdn describes a system of computers networked together across the internet to provide content to users in the most efficient manner to enable an optimal user experience 
in a cdn  nodes or groups of computers are deployed in multiple locations closer to the end user  also known as the edge of the network and cooperate with each other to satisfy requests for content by end users  transparently moving content behind the scenes to optimize the delivery process 
requests for content are directed intelligently through sophisticated software applications to nodes that provide optimal performance for end users 
the cdn platform directs network traffic across our existing physical network and infrastructure 
the cdn platform is composed of the edge server or computer that provides caching and streaming functions  and the global server that provides load balancing that is  a computer that directs the traffic to the most efficient edge server to meet the end user request 
the edge server enables the storage of popular content in a location that is closer to the end user and thereby reduces bandwidth requirements and improves response times for that stored content 
the global server or computer load balancing components of the cdn directs end user requests to the content source that is best able to serve the request of the particular end user  such as routing to the service node that is closest to the end user or to the one with enough capacity to service the request of the end user 
the vyvx platform transmits audio and video programming for our customers over our fiber optic network and via satellite 
we use our network to carry many live traditional broadcast and cable television events from the site of the event to the network control centers of the broadcasters of the event 
these events include  among other things  live sporting events of the major professional sports leagues 
for live events where the location is not known in advance  such as breaking news stories in remote locations  we provide an integrated satellite and fiber optic network based service to transmit the content to our customers 
most of our customers for these services contract for the service on an event by event basis  however  we have some customers who have purchased a dedicated point to point service  which enables these customers to transmit programming at any time 
business support systems in order to pursue our business strategies  we have developed and are continuing to develop and implement a set of integrated software applications designed to automate our operational processes 
these development activities also relate to the integration of the systems that were used by the companies that we have acquired 
through the development of our business support systems  we believe that we have the opportunity to obtain a competitive advantage relative to traditional telecommunications companies 
in addition  we recognize that for the success of certain of our services that some of our business support systems will need to be easily accessible and usable directly by our customers 
we are currently deploying a unified set of simplified processes and systems that have been designed to streamline and synchronize our service  sales and operational functions 
these processes and systems have been designed to provide improved capability in service catalog management  sales opportunity management  customer management  quoting  order entry  order workflow  physical and logical network inventory management  service management  and financial management 
we completed the foundation of this platform at the end of  and we are now focusing on operational efficiency improvements and data integrity and migration 

table of contents key design aspects of the business support system development program are integrated modular applications to allow us to upgrade specific applications as new services are available  a scalable architecture that allows our customers and third party sales channel partners direct access to certain functions that would otherwise have to be performed by our employees  phased completion of software releases designed to allow us to test functionality on an incremental basis  web enabled applications so that on line access to order entry  network operations  billing  and customer care functions are available to all authorized users  including our customers  use of a service oriented architecture that is designed to separate data and applications  and is expected to allow reuse of software capabilities at minimum cost  use of pre developed  commercial off the shelf applications or software as a service saas  where applicable  which will interface with our internally developed applications  and creation of a mobility solution for use by sales and certain operational functions to improve productivity and customer experience 
competition the communications industry has been and remains highly competitive 
in the late s and the early s  significant new capacity was deployed by both existing and new entrants 
this oversupply led to a period of financial restructuring and industry consolidation 
given the significant economies of scale inherent in the communications industry  we believe further consolidation may occur 
our primary competitors are long distance carriers  ilecs  clecs  post telephone and telegraphs  or ptts  content delivery network  or cdn  companies  and other companies that provide communications services 
the following information identifies some key competitors for each of our service offerings 
our key competitors for our wholesale voice service offerings are other providers of wholesale communications services including at t  verizon  centurylink  clecs and national incumbent telecommunications carriers

the communications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology 
for instance  periodic technological advances permit substantial increases in transmission capacity of both new and existing fiber  and the introduction of new products or emergence of new technologies may reduce the cost or increase the supply of certain services similar to those which we plan on providing 
accordingly  in the future our most significant competitors may be new entrants to the communications industry  which unlike the traditional incumbent carriers we also compete with are not burdened by an installed base of outmoded or legacy equipment 
regulation us regulation federal regulation the federal communications commission fcc has jurisdiction over interstate and international communications services 
we have obtained fcc approval to land our transoceanic cables in the united states 
we have also obtained fcc authorization to provide international services on a facilities and resale basis  as well as via various wireless licenses 
under the telecommunications act of the act  any entity  including cable television companies  electric and gas utilities  may enter any telecommunications market  subject to reasonable state regulation of safety  quality and consumer protection 
previously  the act required certain tariffs to define the services  terms  and conditions under which said services were to be offered 
subsequent deregulatory measures have eliminated some tariff requirements for competitive services 
accordingly  as of august   our tariffs for interstate end user services were eliminated and our tariffs for international interexchange services were eliminated on january  our rates must still be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory under the act 
our state tariffs remain in place where required some states do not have  or have eliminated  the requirement to file certain tariffs 
we have historically relied primarily on our sales force and marketing activities to provide information to our customers regarding these matters and expect to continue to do so 
further  in accordance with certain fcc tariff filing requirements  we maintain a schedule of our rates  terms and conditions for our domestic and international private line services on our web site 
special access regulation 
special access services are lit loop or transport facilities that support the transmission of data on a point to point basis  often referred to as private lines 
level purchases a substantial amount of special access services from ilecs and other telecommunications carriers to reach customer premises and  less frequently  to support interoffice transport requirements 
in addition  level provides special access services to end user customers and to other carriers via its own network and or through the resale of other carriers special access services 
the fcc currently regulates ilec flat rate transport and special access charges under the terms of its special access pricing flexibility order  adopted in under the special access pricing flexibility order  ilecs are afforded two different levels of pricing flexibility depending upon the extent of deployment of alternative facilities within particular metropolitan statistical areas msas 
the ilecs have been granted type i or the more limited form of pricing flexibility in most msas in the country and have been granted type ii pricing flexibility in a lesser number of msas 
in january  the fcc commenced an examination of the regulatory framework governing the rates  terms  and conditions under which ilecs subject to price cap regulation provide interstate special access services 
in this rulemaking  the fcc is reviewing both the price cap regime by which ilec special access rates are set in 
table of contents most areas  as well as the pricing flexibility regime under which ilecs have obtained the ability to enter into more individualized relationships with customers based upon certain threshold showings of the presence of competitors in a specific geographic and product market 
we have requested  as a measure of interim relief  that the fcc prohibit or freeze any increases by ilecs in the rates applicable to special access services pending the gathering of data and adoption of final rules in this proceeding 
others have advocated for additional relief  including a revocation altogether of ilec pricing flexibility and or reduction of price cap ilec interstate special access rates 
in august  the fcc froze further grants of type ii pricing flexibility  and in december issued an order stating that it will gather additional data on a mandatory basis from both providers and purchases of special access services so that it the fcc can conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the state of competition in the special access market 
we cannot predict when the fcc will complete its review 
we have also suggested to various government agencies that certain tariff terms of ilec carriers are unjust and unreasonable  particularly given their market power 
while we cannot predict if or when such agencies will act on such matters  the fcc has said that it intends to review these matters as part of its special access competition evaluation 
network neutrality and open internet 
in  the fcc adopted its internet policy statement seeking to safeguard and promote unimpeded access to the internet by announcing the following four general internet policy principles that  subject to reasonable network management  would guide the fcc interpretation of its statutory responsibilities to encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public internet 
specifically  consumers are entitled to access the lawful internet content of their choice  run applications and use services of their choice  subject to the needs of law enforcement  connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network  and competition among network providers  application and service providers  and content providers 
in  the fcc issued an order finding that comcast violated the internet policy statement and engaged in unreasonable network management practices by blocking bittorrent and other peer to peer internet traffic 
the fcc required comcast to disclose details of its network management practices  commit to a plan to cease such practices  and provide details of a new nondiscriminatory network management practice 
comcast appealed the fcc decision to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  which in april of  held that the fcc had failed to show that it had the legal authority to issue the ruling 
on december   the fcc issued a report and order entitled preserving the open internet broadband industry practices the open internet order  which provided  among other things  that broadband providers must be transparent about  and therefore disclose  their network management practices  ii not block lawful content  and not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful content 
the open internet order became effective on november  the open internet order has been subjected to legal challenges and petitions for clarification 
the open internet order does not apply to level  but it does affect how other providers can or must handle traffic delivered to them by level we cannot predict the nature and extent of the effect that further action by the fcc or the courts may have in this area  or their effects on level and its operations 
ip interconnection 
in november  in connection with level s request to augment interconnection capacity with comcast  comcast demanded that level enter into an agreement and pay comcast for additional interconnection capacity 
that capacity was necessary to deliver to comcast subscribers the content that such subscribers requested and which such subscribers purchase the right to receive from comcast 
level agreed to comcast demand under protest  and initiated steps to bring the issue to the attention of federal policy makers 
as part of its acquisition of nbc universal  comcast and its affiliates were subject to a consent decree by the department of justice  portions of which we believe their conduct has violated 
our dispute with comcast has not yet been resolved 
other retail internet service providers have and may continue to make similar demands for payment relating to interconnection capacity necessary to deliver the content requested by their subscribers  and we intend to challenge their right to demand such tolls 
such tolls  if imposed  would affect our underlying costs 
at present  we cannot predict the outcome of these ip interconnection disputes 

table of contents intercarrier compensation 
telecommunications carriers compensate one another for traffic carried on each other networks 
interexchange carriers pay access charges to local telephone companies for long distance calls that originate and terminate on local networks 
local telephone companies typically charge one another for local and internet bound traffic terminating on each other networks 
the entire methodology by which carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic  whether it be for local  intrastate or interstate traffic  has been under review by the fcc for over a decade 
on november   the fcc released its report and order and further order of proposed rulemaking  fcc release no 
 on nov 
 fcc order 
along with addressing other matters  the fcc order established a prospective intercarrier compensation framework for terminating switched access and voip traffic  with elements of it becoming effective starting december  under the fcc order  most terminating switched access charges and all reciprocal compensation charges were capped at current levels  and will then be reduced to zero over  as relevant to level  a six year transition period beginning july  several states  industry groups  and other telecommunications carriers filed petitions for reconsideration with the fcc as well as petitions for review of the fcc order in federal courts 
the outcome of those petitions is unpredictable 
on december   on its own motion  the fcc modified two aspects of the fcc order  one of which impacts intercarrier compensation 
the fcc determined that intercarrier compensation for local traffic exchanged between telecommunications carriers and commercial mobile radio service providers pursuant to an interconnection agreement in effect as of the adoption date of the order will be subject to a default bill and keep that is  carriers do not bill each other methodology on july   rather than december level maintains approximately interconnection agreements with other telecommunications carriers 
these agreements set out the terms and conditions under which the parties will exchange traffic 
the largest agreements are with at t and verizon 
most of level s agreements with at t and verizon have expired terms  but remain effective in evergreen status 
as these and other interconnection agreements expire  we will continue to evaluate simply allowing them to continue in evergreen status so long as the counterparty allows it or negotiating new agreements 
any renegotiation would involve uncertainty as to the final terms and conditions  including the compensation rates for various types of traffic 
in addition  changes in law  including the fcc order or other decisions  may allow or compel us to renegotiate current and successor interconnection agreements over the next year 
intercarrier compensation voip 
pursuant to the fcc order  voip  while remaining unclassified as either an information or a telecommunications service  was prospectively categorized as either local or non local traffic 
if local  then voip traffic is subject to reciprocal compensation  if non local  then it is subject to interstate rates thus eliminating any intrastate access rate applicable to voip 
the fcc order did not address the treatment of voip retroactively 
level is involved in a number of intercarrier compensation disputes dealing with the rating of voip traffic 
at this time  we cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings or the timing for their eventual resolution 
as noted above  the effectiveness of the fcc order has been appealed  and the outcome of these appeals is uncertain 
intercarrier compensation isp bound traffic 
since  the issue of compensation to be paid for calls dialed to internet service providers or isps has been heavily litigated 
in its decision on november   the fcc responded to a mandamus order from the united states circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia concerning its isp remand order 
in that mandamus order  the fcc clarified that it had jurisdiction over isp bound traffic pursuant to the reciprocal compensation provisions of the act regardless of whether the traffic was local or long distance 
the fcc then decided to maintain the existing compensation regime it had established for isp bound traffic with a rate of per minute of use 
the court of appeals for the united states in the district of columbia upheld the fcc order in january despite their breadth  some carriers continue to argue that certain types of isp bound traffic are not covered by the and orders  and several state commissions and courts have agreed 
continued findings of this nature could affect the charges for isp bound traffic until these issues are settled or ultimately decided by further appeals or the fcc 
at this time  we cannot predict what the eventual resolutions will be 

table of contents other voip regulation 
the fcc has classified voip services as interstate services subject to fcc regulations  and has stated that states have limited authority to regulate the offering of voip services 
on september   vonage holdings corporation vonage filed a petition with the fcc requesting a declaration that its offerings  which originate on a broadband network in ip format and terminate on the pstn  are interstate information services not subject to state regulation under the act and existing fcc rules 
on november   the fcc adopted an order which was subsequently upheld on appeal ruling that vonage service was an interstate service not subject to state regulation 
on june   the fcc issued an order which was subsequently upheld on appeal requiring all interconnected voip providers to deliver enhanced capabilities to their subscribers by no later than november  we have modified our service offerings to voip providers in order to assist them in complying with the fcc mandate  and have ensured that our retail voip services comply with these rules 
the fcc has imposed further regulatory requirements in recent years on voip providers that had previously been applicable only to traditional telecommunications providers  such as obligations to contribute to the federal universal service fund  to comply with regulations relating to local number portability including contributing to the costs of managing number portability requirements  to abide by the fcc service discontinuance rules  to contribute to the telecommunications relay services fund  and to abide by the regulations concerning customer proprietary network information and the communications assistance for law enforcement act 
in addition  a number of state public utility commissions are conducting regulatory proceedings that could affect our rights and obligations with respect to ip based voice applications 
specifically  some states have taken the position that the local component of voip service is subject to traditional regulations applicable to local telecommunications services  such as the obligation to pay intrastate universal service fees 
we cannot predict whether the fcc or state public utility commissions will impose additional requirements  regulations or charges upon our provision of services related to ip communications 
the fcc is also reconsidering whether to allow certain interconnected voip providers  via a waiver  to obtain direct access to telephone numbering resources  which are currently only available to telecommunications carriers 
on december   the fcc released a public notice refreshing the record on a proceeding concerning the same issue  following the fcc decision  in  to grant a non carrier a waiver to obtain its own numbering resources 
we cannot predict whether the fcc will grant some or all interconnected voip providers direct access to numbering resources as a result of this proceeding 
universal service 
level is subject to federal and state regulations that implement universal service support for access to communications services in rural  high cost and low income markets at reasonable rates  and access to advanced communications services by schools  libraries and rural health care providers 
the fcc assesses level a percentage of interstate and international revenue it receives from retail customers as its contribution to the federal universal service fund 
additionally  the fcc recently ruled that states may assess contributions to their state universal service fund from voip providers 
any change in the assessment methodology may affect level s revenues  but at this time it is not possible to predict the extent we would be affected  if at all 
network security agreement 
in connection with the acquisition of global crossing  we entered into an agreement the network security agreement with certain agencies of the us government to address the us government national security and law enforcement concerns 
the network security agreement is intended i to ensure our ability to carry out lawfully authorized us government electronic surveillance of communications that originate and or terminate in the us  ii to prevent and detect access and use of us communications  and iii to satisfy us critical infrastructure protection requirements 
failure to comply with our obligations under the network security agreement could result in the revocation of our telecommunications licenses by the fcc and other penalties 
the network security agreement also imposes significant requirements related to information storage and management  traffic routing and management  physical  logical and network security  personnel screening and training  audit  reporting and other matters 

table of contents state regulation the act is intended to increase competition in the telecommunications industry  especially in the local exchange market 
with respect to local services  ilecs are required to allow interconnection to their networks and to provide unbundled access to network facilities  as well as a number of other pro competitive measures 
the implementation of the act continues to be subject to numerous state rulemaking proceedings on these issues 
state regulatory agencies have jurisdiction when our facilities and services are used to provide intrastate telecommunications services 
a portion of our traffic may be classified as intrastate telecommunications and therefore subject to state regulation 
we expect that we will offer more intrastate telecommunications services including intrastate switched services as our business and product lines expand 
we are authorized to provide telecommunications services in all fifty states and the district of columbia 
in addition  we need to maintain interconnection agreements with ilecs where we wish to provide service 
we expect that we should be able to negotiate or otherwise obtain renewals or successor agreements through adoption of others contracts or arbitration proceedings  although the rates  terms  and conditions applicable to interconnection and the exchange of traffic with certain ilecs could change significantly in certain cases 
the degree to which the rates  terms  and conditions may change will depend not only upon the negotiation and arbitration process and availability of other interconnection agreements  but will also depend in significant part upon state commission proceedings that either uphold or modify the current regimes governing interconnection and the exchange of certain kinds of traffic between carriers 
there are initiatives in several state legislatures to lower intrastate access rates  aligning them with interstate rates  some of which may be affected by the fcc order on intercarrier compensation 
while we believe that rate adjustment initiatives such as this are generally better considered holistically by the fcc as part of its overall intercarrier compensation reforms  some states have and may continue to determine otherwise 
depending on whether we are a net collector or a net payer of any adjusted rate  such rate adjustments could have a negative effect on us 
some states also require prior approvals or notifications for certain transfers of assets  customers or ownership of certificated carriers and for issuances by certified carriers of equity or debt 
local regulation our networks are subject to numerous local regulations such as building permitting trenching codes and licensing franchise fees 
such regulations vary on a city by city  county by county and state by state basis 
to install our own fiber optic transmission facilities  we need to obtain rights of way over privately and publicly owned land 
rights of way that are not already secured  or which may expire and not be renewed  may not be available to us on economically reasonable or advantageous terms in the future 
european regulation unlike the united states which has a federal state regulatory scheme  the european union has adopted a more systematic approach to the convergence of networks and the regulation of telecommunications services 
the european commission oversees the implementation by its member states of various directives developed to regulate electronic communications in a technology and platform neutral manner 
in february  the european union adopted a new regulatory framework for electronic communications that is designed to address in a technologically neutral manner the convergence of communications across telecommunications  computer and broadcasting networks 
the directives address framework interconnection and access  authorization and licensing  universal service and privacy 
these directives along with an additional decision on radio spectrum set out the basis for regulation at the national level 
pursuant to these measures  the licensing regime was replaced with one of general authorization 
our existing licenses were canceled and replaced with statutory authorization  subject to various general conditions imposed by national regulatory authorities nras 
nras continue to be responsible for issuing specific licenses in relation to radio spectrum 

table of contents in november  the european parliament and council of ministers agreed to implement a number of changes to the existing regime  comprising the better regulation directive directive ec and the citizens rights directive directive ec  which are intended to improve the existing regulatory framework  and ensure that the needs of users are more clearly defined and to remove potential ambiguity within the existing framework in a number of areas such as the processing of personal data 
the legislation which transposes the two directives above into national law required member states to enact various amendments into national legislation by may the framework directive revised requires national regulatory authorities nras  on a rolling basis  to analyze a set of markets for electronic communications which may require ex ante regulation in order to function competitively 
this analysis contains three different elements market definition first the nra must define the relevant geographic and product market 
smp assessment in a second step the nra must analyze whether one or more undertaking active in that market possesses significant market power conceptually similar to dominance  either individually or jointly with others 
decision on remedies if the nra identifies a market with a lack of effective competition  it is required to impose certain regulatory obligations  so called remedies 
the basis for this measure is the european commission recommendation on relevant markets  which contains a list of markets that should be subject to ex ante regulation 
whenever a nra concludes that a given market shows failures that hamper competition  it must impose appropriate remedies on undertakings with a significant market power in accordance with the market access directive and universal service directives 
in october  the commission commenced a review of its recommendation on relevant markets and the process is expected to conclude during it is possible that this process will affect the degree of ex ante regulation currently applied in relation to wholesale access products 
notwithstanding a synchronized approach to regulation in europe  the implementation of the directives has not been uniform across the member states of the european union 
recognizing this concern  in november  the eu implemented one regulation establishing the body of european regulators for electronic communications regulation ec no berec 
berec remit is to improve harmonization between national regulatory measures so as to ensure greater consistency of remedies and to anticipate emerging regulatory requirements 
during  berec adopted a common position on several issues of relevance  including wholesale local and broadband access  wholesale leased lines and net neutrality 
additionally  in november  berec issued a statement opposing the european telecommunications network operators association proposals for the review of the international telecommunications regulations 
at the time of writing  berec work programme for was not available 
in  the eu adopted a long term strategic policy known as the digital agenda for europe  aimed at ensuring that the eu derives the maximum economic  industrial and social benefit from advanced communications services  including the extensive roll out of superfast broadband 
the majority of member states have each adopted their own national policies in support of this high level agenda 
for example  in the uk  the government indicated in december  the adoption of a policy objective to ensure that every community in the country will have access to superfast broadband by which  it is acknowledged  will require significant new investment in infrastructure projects 
in december  the office of communications ofcom published its draft annual plan for indicating that one of its key objectives is to ensure effective competition in the business connectivity market which may have a material effect on our business 

table of contents canadian regulation the canadian radio television and telecommunications commission crtc regulates telecommunications providers and their service offerings in canada 
regulatory developments over the past several years have terminated the historic monopolies of the ilecs  bringing significant competition to this industry for both domestic and international long distance services 
the provision of canadian domestic and international transmission facilities based services is no longer restricted to canadian carriers 
prior to june  these carriers had to have majority ownership and control in fact by canadians 
there are no such canadian ownership and control requirements for companies that resell the services and facilities of a canadian carrier 
accordingly  we have historically operated as a reseller of canadian domestic and international transmission facilities based services in canada 
last june  material ownership restrictions were repealed  thus allowing us to register with the crtc as a facilities based telecommunications common carrier 
we did so in december  and also obtained a basic international telecommunications service license  allowing us to carry traffic that originates or terminates in points outside of canada 
we anticipate that we will be able to expand operations and service offerings in canada in and beyond 
latin american regulation the regulatory status of the telecommunications markets in latin america varies to some degree 
all of the countries in which we currently operate are members of the world trade organization  and most have committed to some deregulatory measures such as market competition and foreign ownership 
some countries now permit competition for all telecommunications facilities and services  while others allow less competition for some facilities and services  but restrict competition for other services 
some countries in which we operate currently impose limits on foreign ownership of telecommunications carriers 
the telecommunications regulatory regimes of many latin american countries are in the process of development 
many issues  such as regulation of incumbent providers  interconnection  unbundling of local loops  resale of telecommunications services  and pricing have not been addressed fully  or even at all 
we cannot accurately predict whether and how these issues will be resolved  or their effect on our operations 
below is a summary of certain of the regulations currently applicable to our latin american operations  by country 
the regulations apply equally to all of our operating entities in a given country 
argentina the argentine telecommunications sector is subject to comprehensive regulation by the comisi n nacional de comunicaciones national communications commission and the secretar a de comunicaciones secretary of communications 
the argentine telecommunications market was opened to competition on november  following market liberalization  the government issued a series of regulations to effectuate the transition to competition  including decree no 
the decree established rules for the granting of licenses for telecommunications services  interconnection  and the management and control of the radio spectrum 
the decree also established new rules and regulations to promote access to telecommunications services for customers located in high cost access or maintenance areas or with physical limitations or special social needs 
these rules and regulations  effective january   established that these services would be financed by all telecommunications providers including us through a universal service fund  backed by the payment of of each provider total revenues for telecommunications services 
there have been no major changes in the argentine regulatory framework since its adoption in  other than for the introduction of wireless number portability in by joint resolutions and issued by the secretary of communications and the secretary of domestic trade

chile the telecommunications industry in chile is regulated by the undersecretariat of telecommunications  a department under the ministry of transportation and telecommunications 
in  the national policy on telecommunications was issued which  in its most relevant aspects  called for the development of telecommunications services to be conducted by private institutions through authorizations granted by the government 
however  it also endorsed a series of regulations aimed at establishing increased technical control over such investments and conferring certain discretionary powers upon the government 
the policy was formalized through the general law on telecommunications approved in  in which free  non discriminatory access was granted to private firms in the development of the nation telecommunications services 
this law established responsibilities with respect to telecommunication services  compulsory interconnection of facilities between public service licensees  and effectuated mandatory tariffing of services where existing market conditions were deemed insufficient to guarantee a free tariff system 
chile amended its general law on telecommunications in to provide that concessions and permits may be granted without limit depending upon the quantity and type of service and geographic location 
the law guarantees interconnection among telecommunications service concessionaires 
chile defines value added services as supplementary services 
it is not necessary to have a telecommunications service license to offer supplementary services  although those who provide additional services must comply with the technical standards established by the department of telecommunications  and obtain authorization therefrom

risks related to our business operations although we expect that the acquisition of global crossing will result in benefits to us  we may not realize those benefits because of integration difficulties and other challenges 
the success of our acquisition of global crossing depends in large part on the success of management in integrating the operations  strategies  technologies and personnel of the two companies 
we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the global crossing acquisition if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected 
our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of global crossing or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the global crossing acquisition could impair our operations 
in addition  the overall integration of global crossing is a time consuming and expensive process that  without continued proper planning and effective and timely implementation  could significantly disrupt our business 

table of contents potential difficulties the combined business may encounter in the integration process include the following the integration of management teams  strategies  technologies  operations  accounting and data processing systems  management controls  products and services  the disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of the management team from ongoing business concerns  the retention of the existing customers and or vendors of both companies  the creation of uniform standards  controls  procedures  policies and information systems  the reduction of the costs associated with each company operations  the consolidation and rationalization of information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures  the integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale  the retention of key employees  and potential unknown liabilities associated with the global crossing acquisition 
the anticipated benefits and synergies include the combination of offices in various locations and the elimination of numerous technology systems  duplicative personnel and duplicative market and other data sources 
however  these anticipated benefits and synergies assume a successful integration and are based on projections  which are inherently uncertain  and other assumptions 
even if integration is successful  anticipated benefits and synergies may not be achieved 
continued uncertainty in the global financial markets and the global economy may negatively affect our financial results 
continued uncertainty in the global financial markets and economy may negatively affect our financial results 
a prolonged period of economic decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and exacerbate some of the other risk factors we describe herein 
our operating results and financial condition could be negatively affected if  as a result of economic conditions customers cancel  defer or forgo purchases of our services  customers are unable to make timely payments to us  the demand for  and prices of  our services are reduced as a result of actions by our competitors or otherwise  key suppliers upon which we rely are unwilling or unable to provide us with the materials we need for our network on a timely basis or on terms that we find acceptable  or our financial counterparties  insurance providers or other contractual counterparties are unable to  or do not meet  their contractual commitments to us 

table of contents we need to increase revenue from the services that we offer to realize our targets for financial and operating performance 
we must increase revenue from our data  voice  content and infrastructure services at acceptable margins in order to realize our targets for financial and operating performance 
if we do not avoid excessive customer churn or improve our current relationships with existing key customers  we are not able to expand the available capacity on our network to meet our customers demands in a timely manner  we do not develop new large volume and enterprise customers  or our customers determine to obtain these services from either their own network or from one of our competitors  we may not be able to increase or maintain our revenue at acceptable margins  which would adversely affect our ability to become and or remain profitable 
our business requires the continued development of effective business support systems to implement customer orders and to provide and bill for services 
our business depends on our ability to continue to develop effective business support systems 
in certain cases  the development of these business support systems is required to realize anticipated benefits from any acquisitions 
this is a complicated undertaking requiring significant resources and expertise and support from third party vendors 
following the development of the business support systems  the data migration regarding network and circuit inventory must be completed for the full benefit of the systems to be realized 
business support systems are needed for quoting  accepting and inputting customer orders for services  provisioning  installing and delivering services  providing customers with direct access to our information systems so that they can manage the services that they purchase from us  generally through web based customer portals  and billing for services 
because our business provides for continued rapid growth in the number of customers that we serve  the volume of services offered as well as the integration of any acquired companies business support systems  there is a need to continue to develop our business support systems on a schedule sufficient to meet proposed milestone dates 
the failure to continue to develop effective unified business support systems or complete the data migration regarding network and circuit inventory into these systems could materially adversely affect our ability to implement our business plans and realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions 
we may lose customers if we experience system failures that significantly disrupt the availability and quality of the services that we provide 
system failures may also cause interruptions to service delivery and the completion of other corporate functions 
our operations depend on our ability to limit and mitigate interruptions or degradation in service for customers 
interruptions in service or performance problems  for whatever reason  could undermine confidence in our services and cause us to lose customers or make it more difficult to attract new ones 
in addition  because many of our services are critical to the businesses of many of our customers  any significant interruption or degradation in 
table of contents service could result in lost profits or other losses to customers 
although we generally limit our liability for service failures in our service agreements to limited service credits generally in the form of free service for a short period of time and generally exclude any liability for consequential damages such as lost profits  a court might not enforce these limitations on liability in the manner contemplated  which could expose us to financial loss 
in addition  we often provide our customers with committed service levels 
if we are unable to meet these service level commitments  we may be obligated to provide service credits or other compensation to our customers 
because we offer emergency notification services referred to as services  any significant interruption or degradation in those services could create legal and financial exposure 
the failure of any equipment or facility on our network  including our network operations control centers and network data storage locations  could result in the interruption of customer service and other corporate functions until necessary repairs are effected or replacement equipment is installed 
in addition  our business continuity plans may not be adequate to address a particular failure that we experience 
delays  errors  network equipment or network facility failures  including with respect to our network operations control centers and network data storage locations  could also result from natural disasters including natural disasters that may increase in frequency as a result of the effects of climate change  disease  accidents  terrorist acts  power losses  security breaches  vandalism or other illegal acts  computer viruses  or other causes 
our business could be significantly hurt from these delays  errors  failures or faults including as a result of service interruptions  exposure to customer liability  the inability to install new service  the unavailability of employees necessary to provide services  the delay in the completion of other corporate functions such as issuing bills and the preparation of financial statements  or the need for expensive modifications to our systems and infrastructure 
if our security measures are breached  or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our systems  products and services  we may experience significant legal and financial exposure  our products and services may be perceived as not being secure  users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services  and our business may be disrupted 
network and information systems and other technologies are critical to our business activities 
network and information systems related events such as computer hackings  cyber attacks  computer viruses  worms or other destructive or disruptive software  process breakdowns  denial of service attacks or other malicious activities  or any combination of the these items  could result in a degradation or disruption of our services  damage to our properties  equipment and data  or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
we experience cyber attacks against our network and information systems of varying degrees on a regular basis  and as a result  unauthorized parties could obtain access to our data or our customers data 
our security measures may also be breached due to employee error  malfeasance  or otherwise 
additionally  outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our customers data  including information subject to data protection laws and regulations such as the national laws implementing the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information 
the risk of these systems related events and security breaches occurring has intensified  in part because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our businesses in digital form stored on servers connected to the internet 

table of contents while we develop and maintain systems and processes designed to prevent systems related events and security breaches from occurring  the development and maintenance of these systems and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 
despite our efforts  there can be no assurance that unauthorized access and security breaches will not occur in the future 
in addition  because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access  disable or degrade service  or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
any security breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure  including in respect of customer credits  lost revenues due to business interruption  increased expenditures on security measures  monetary damages  regulatory enforcement actions  fines and or criminal prosecution 
in addition  damage to our reputation and the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could cause us to lose customers 
moreover  the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses resulting from unauthorized access or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our businesses that may result 
failure to develop and introduce new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry 
we continuously develop  test and introduce new services that are delivered over our communications network 
these new services are intended to allow us to address new segments of the communications marketplace  address the changing communications needs of our existing customers and compete for additional customers 
in certain instances  the introduction of new services requires the successful development of new technology 
to the extent that upgrades of existing technology are required for the introduction of new services  the success of these upgrades may be dependent on reaching mutually acceptable terms with vendors and on vendors meeting their obligations in a timely manner 
in addition  new service offerings may not be widely accepted by our customers 
if our new service offerings are not widely accepted by our customers  we may terminate those service offerings and we may be required to impair any assets or technology used to develop or offer those services 
if we are not able to successfully complete the development and introduction of new services in a timely manner  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage expansions to our operations 
we may continue to expand our operations through new product and service offerings and through additional strategic investments  acquisitions or joint ventures  some of which may involve complex technical and operational challenges 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to manage our expansion opportunities  which pose numerous risks and uncertainties  including the need to integrate new operations into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner  to combine accounting and data processing systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers  vendors and business partners 
in addition  future acquisitions or joint ventures may involve the issuance of additional shares of our common stock  which may dilute our stockholders ownership 
any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of risks  including problems with the effective integration of operations  inability to maintain key pre acquisition business relationships  increased operating costs  exposure to unanticipated liabilities  and 
table of contents difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings 
we continually evaluate potential investments and strategic opportunities to expand  enhance connectivity and add traffic to our network 
in the future  we may seek additional investments  strategic alliances or similar arrangements  which may expose us to risks such as the difficulty of identifying appropriate investments  strategic allies or opportunities on terms acceptable to us  the possibility that senior management may be required to spend considerable time negotiating agreements and monitoring these arrangements  potential regulatory issues applicable to the telecommunications industry  the loss or reduction in value of the capital investment  our inability to capitalize on the opportunities presented by these arrangements  and the possibility of insolvency of a strategic ally 
we cannot assure you that our future expansion or acquisition opportunities will be successful  or that we will realize expected operating efficiencies  cost savings  revenue enhancements  synergies or other benefits 
our future growth depends upon the continued development and expansion of the internet as a communications medium and marketplace for the distribution and consumption of data and video by businesses  consumers and governments 
achieving the anticipated benefits of our business operations will depend in part upon the continued development and expansion of the internet as a communications medium and marketplace for the distribution and consumption of data and video by businesses  consumers and governments 
the use of the internet for these purposes may not grow and expand at the rate that we anticipate or may be restricted by such things as actions by isps or the owners of access networks that restrict us from delivering our customers traffic to the users of those networks  future regulation  a lack of anticipated technology innovation and adoption  or a lack of continued broadband penetration both in the united states and elsewhere 
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in increasing sales of our content distribution service offering 
as we believe that one of the largest sources of future incremental demand for our services will be derived from customers that are seeking to distribute their video  feature rich content or applications over the internet  we offer a variety of content distribution network  or cdn  and related services 
there are many difficulties that we may encounter in selling these services  including customer support system development issues  intellectual property matters  technological issues  increasing capacity on our network to meet our customers demands in a timely manner  developmental constraints and other problems that we may not anticipate 
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in generating significant revenues from our cdn service offering 

table of contents intellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent us from using necessary technology to provide our services or subject us to expensive intellectual property litigation 
if technology that is necessary for us to provide our services was determined by a court to infringe a patent held by another entity that is unwilling to grant us a license on terms acceptable to us  we could be precluded by a court order from using that technology and we would likely be required to pay a significant monetary damages award to the patent holder 
the successful enforcement of these patents  or our inability to negotiate a license for these patents on acceptable terms  could force us to cease using the relevant technology and offering services incorporating the technology 
in the event that a claim of infringement was brought against us based on the use of our technology or against our customers based on their use of our services for which we are obligated to indemnify  we could be subject to litigation to determine whether such use or sale is  in fact  infringing 
this litigation could be expensive and distracting  regardless of the outcome of the suit 
while our own patent portfolio may deter other operating companies from bringing such actions  patent infringement claims are increasingly being asserted by patent holding companies  which do not use technology and whose sole business is to enforce patents against operators  such as us  for monetary gain 
because such patent holding companies do not provide services or use technology  the assertion of our own patents by way of counter claim would be largely ineffective 
we have already been the subject of time consuming and expensive patent litigation brought by certain patent holding companies and we can reasonably expect that we will face further claims in the future 
our consolidated revenue is concentrated in a limited number of customers 
a significant portion of our consolidated revenue is concentrated among a limited number of customers 
for the year ended december   our top ten customers represented approximately of our total consolidated revenue 
if we lost one or more of our major customers  or  if one or more of them significantly decreased orders for our services  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
we have generated substantial net losses and may continue to do so 
for the fiscal years ended december    and  we incurred net losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
although we anticipate that our operating results will improve over time  there can be no assurance that currently anticipated operating improvements will be realized on schedule or that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
continued net losses could limit our ability to fund expansions of our network  investments in our products and services  interest and principal payments on our debt  or other business needs 
future expansion or adaptation of our network will require substantial resources  which may not be available at the time 
we will need to continue to expand and adapt our network in order to remain competitive  which may require significant additional funding 
additional expansion and adaptations of our communications network electronic and software components will be necessary in order to respond to growing number of customers  the development and launching of new services  increased demands by customers to transmit larger amounts of data  changes in customers service requirements  technological advances by competitors  and 
table of contents governmental regulations 
future expansion or adaptation of our network will require substantial additional financial  operational and managerial resources  which may not be available at the time 
we may be unable to expand or adapt our network to respond to these developments on a timely basis and at a commercially reasonable cost 
the market prices for many of our services have decreased in the past and may decrease in the future  resulting in lower revenue and margins than we anticipate 
over the past few years  the market prices for many of our services have decreased 
these decreases resulted from downward market pressure and other factors including technological changes and network expansions which have resulted in increased transmission capacity available for sale by us and by our competitors  some of our customer agreements contain volume based pricing or other contractually agreed upon decreases in prices during the term of the respective agreements  and some of our competitors have been willing to accept smaller operating margins in the short term in an attempt to increase long term revenues 
in order to retain customers and revenue  we often must reduce prices in response to market conditions and trends 
as our prices for some of our services decrease  our operating results may suffer unless we are able to either reduce our operating expenses or increase traffic volume from which we can derive additional revenue 
we also expect revenue from our managed modem services to continue to decline primarily as a result of end users migrating to broadband services 
the need to obtain additional capacity for our network from other providers increases our costs 
in addition  the need to interconnect our network to networks that are controlled by others could increase our costs 
we use network resources owned by other companies for portions of our network 
we obtain the right to use such network portions  including both telecommunications capacity and rights to use dark fiber  through operating leases and iru agreements 
in several of those agreements  the counter party is responsible for network maintenance and repair 
if a counter party to a lease or iru suffers financial distress or bankruptcy  we may not be able to enforce our rights to use these network assets or  even if we could continue to use these network assets  we could incur material expenses related to maintenance and repair 
we could also incur material expenses if we were required to locate alternative network assets 
we may not be successful in obtaining reasonable alternative network assets if needed 
failure to obtain usage of alternative network assets  if necessary  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry on business operations 
in addition  some of our agreements with other providers require the payment of amounts for services whether or not those services are used 
in the normal course of business  we need to enter into interconnection agreements with many domestic and foreign local telephone companies as well as the owners of networks that our customers desire to access in order to deliver their services 
we are not always able to secure these interconnection agreements on favorable terms 
for example  in november  in connection with level s request to augment interconnection capacity with comcast  comcast demanded that level enter into an agreement and pay comcast for interconnection capacity comcast required to deliver to comcast subscribers the content that such subscribers requested and which such subscribers purchase the right to receive from comcast 
level agreed to comcast demand under protest  and initiated steps to bring the issue to the attention of federal policy makers 
as part of its acquisition of nbc universal  comcast and its affiliates were subject to a consent decree by the department of justice  portions of which we believe their conduct has violated 
our dispute with comcast has not yet been resolved 
other retail internet service providers have and may continue to make similar demands for payment relating to interconnection capacity necessary to deliver the content requested by their subscribers  and we intend to challenge their right to 
table of contents demand such tolls 
such tolls  if imposed  would affect our underlying costs 
we cannot predict the outcome of these ip interconnection disputes 
costs of obtaining service from other communications carriers comprise a significant proportion of the operating expenses of long distance carriers 
similarly  a large proportion of the costs of providing international service consists of payments to other carriers 
changes in regulation  particularly the regulation of local and international telecommunication carriers and local access network owners  could indirectly  but significantly  affect our competitive position 
these changes could increase or decrease the costs of providing our services 
we may be unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel  the loss of any of our key executive officers could adversely affect our business 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled  knowledgeable  sophisticated and qualified managerial  professional and technical personnel 
we have experienced significant competition in attracting and retaining personnel who possess the skills that we are seeking 
as a result of this significant competition  we may experience a shortage of qualified personnel 
critical decisions regarding our businesses are managed by a small number of key executive officers 
the loss of any of these key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are subject to regulation in each of the countries in which we operate and require us to obtain and maintain a number of governmental licenses and permits 
if we fail to comply with those regulatory requirements or to obtain and maintain those licenses and permits  including payment of related fees  if any  we may not be able to conduct our business in that jurisdiction 
moreover  those regulatory requirements could change in a manner that significantly increases our costs or otherwise adversely affects our operations 
in the ordinary course of constructing our networks and providing our services  we are required to obtain and maintain a variety of telecommunications and other licenses and authorizations in the countries in which we operate  as well as rights of way from utilities  railroads  incumbent carriers and other persons 
we also must comply with a variety of regulatory obligations 
due to the political and economic risks associated with the countries in which we operate  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our licenses or that they will be renewed upon their expiration 
our failure to obtain or maintain necessary licenses  authorizations and rights of way  or to comply with the obligations imposed upon license holders including the payment of fees  in one or more countries  may result in sanctions or additional costs  including the revocation of authority to provide services in one or more countries 
in addition  our subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that  among other things  challenge the subsidiaries use of rights of way 
the plaintiffs have sought to have these lawsuits certified as class actions 
it is possible that additional suits challenging use of our rights of way will be filed and that those plaintiffs also may seek class certification 
the outcome of such litigation may increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results 
our operations around the world are subject to regulation at the regional level for example  the european union  the national level for example  the fcc and  in many cases  at the state  provincial  and local levels 
we also operate in some areas of the world without licenses  but only as permitted through relationships with locally licensed partners 
the regulation of telecommunications networks and services around the world varies widely 
in some countries  the range of services that we are legally permitted to provide may be limited  or may change 
in other countries  existing telecommunications legislation is in the process of development  is unclear or inconsistent  or is applied in an unequal or discriminatory fashion  or inadequate judicial  regulatory or other forums are available to address these inadequacies or disputes 
changes to existing regulations or rules  or the failure to regulate going forward in areas which have historically been regulated on matters such as network neutrality  licensing fees  environmental  health and safety  privacy  intercarrier compensation  interconnection and other areas  in general or particular to our industry  may increase costs  restrict operations or decrease revenues 
our inability or failure to comply with the telecommunications and other laws and regulations of one or more of the countries in which we 
table of contents operate could result in the temporary or permanent suspension of operations in one or more countries 
we also may be prohibited from entering certain countries at all or from providing all of our services in one or more countries 
in addition  many of the countries in which we operate are conducting regulatory or other proceedings that will affect the implementation of their telecommunications legislation 
we cannot be certain of the outcome of these proceedings 
these proceedings may affect the manner in which we are permitted to provide our services in these countries as well as the level of fees and taxes payable to the government 
termination of relationships with key suppliers could cause delay and additional costs 
our business is dependent on third party suppliers for fiber  computers  software  optronics  transmission electronics and related components as well as providers of network colocation facilities and right of way rights that are integrated into our network  some of which are critical to the operation of our business 
if any of these critical relationships is terminated  a supplier either exits or curtails its business as a result of economic conditions  a supplier fails to provide critical rights of use  services or equipment  or the supplier is forced to stop providing services due to legal constraints  such as patent infringement  and we are unable to reach suitable alternative arrangements quickly  we may experience significant additional costs or we may not be able to provide certain services to customers 
ilecs may not provide us local access services at prices that allow us to effectively compete 
we acquire a significant portion of our local access services  the connection between our owned network and the customer premises  from incumbent local exchange carriers or ilecs 
the ilecs compete directly with our business and may have a tendency to favor themselves and their affiliates to our detriment 
network access represents a very large portion of our total costs and if we face less favorable pricing and provisioning timeframes  we may be at a competitive disadvantage to the ilecs 
in some instances it is expensive and difficult to switch new customers to our network  and lack of cooperation of incumbent carriers can slow the new customer connection process 
it is expensive  difficult and time consuming for new customers to switch to our network if we require cooperation from the incumbent carrier in instances where there is no direct connection between the customer and our network 
many of our principal competitors  the domestic and international incumbent carriers  are already established providers of local telephone services to all or virtually all telephone subscribers within their respective service areas 
their physical connections from their premises to those of their customers are expensive and difficult to duplicate 
to complete the new customer provisioning process for a customer location that is not located on our network  we rely on the incumbent carrier to process certain information 
the incumbent carriers have a financial interest in retaining their customers  which could reduce their willingness to cooperate with our new customer provisioning requests  thereby adversely affecting our ability to compete and increase revenue 
further consolidation of incumbent carriers with other telecommunications service providers may make these problems more acute 
we may be liable for the information that content owners or distributors distribute over our network 
the law relating to the liability of private network operators for information carried on or disseminated through their networks is still unsettled 
while we disclaim any liability for third party content in our services agreements  we may become subject to legal claims relating to the content disseminated on our network  even though such content is owned or distributed by our customers or a customer of our customers 
for example  lawsuits may be brought against us claiming that material distributed using our network was inaccurate  offensive  or violated the law or the rights of others 
claims could also involve matters such as defamation  invasion of privacy and copyright infringement 
in addition  the law remains unclear over whether content may be distributed from one jurisdiction  where the content is legal  into another jurisdiction  where it is not 
companies operating private networks have been sued in the past  sometimes successfully  based on the nature of material distributed  even if the content is not owned by the network operator and the network operator has no knowledge of the content or its legality 
it is not practical for us to monitor all of the content that is distributed using our network 
we may need to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks or to defend ourselves against such claims 

table of contents our financial condition and growth depends upon the successful integration of any business we may acquire in the future 
we may not be able to efficiently and effectively integrate such future acquired operations  and thus may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from them 
achieving the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions depends in part upon whether we can integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner 
we may acquire businesses in accordance with our business strategy 
the integration of any acquired businesses involves a number of risks  including  but not limited to demands on management related to any significant increase in size after the acquisition  the disruption of ongoing business and the diversion of management attention from the management of daily operations to management of integration activities  failure to fully achieve expected synergies and costs savings  unanticipated impediments in the integration of departments  systems  including accounting systems  technologies  books and records  procedures and policies  as well as in maintaining uniform standards and controls  including internal control over financial reporting  loss of customers or the failure of customers to order incremental services that we expect them to order  failure to provision services that are ordered by customers during the integration period  higher integration costs than anticipated  and difficulties in the assimilation and retention of highly qualified  experienced employees  many of whom may be geographically dispersed 
successful integration of acquired businesses or operations depends on our ability to manage these operations  realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened service offerings and expanded geographic market coverage  obtain better terms from our vendors due to increased buying power  and eliminate redundant and excess costs to fully realize the expected synergies 
because of difficulties in combining geographically distant operations and systems which may not be fully compatible  we may not be able to achieve these objectives 
we cannot be certain that we will realize our anticipated benefits from our acquisitions  or that we will be able to efficiently and effectively integrate acquired operations as planned 
changes in regulations affecting commercial power providers may increase our costs 
in the normal course of business  we need to enter into agreements with many providers of commercial power for our office  network  gateway facilities  and colocation and data center facilities 
costs of obtaining commercial power comprise a significant component of our operating expenses 
changes in regulations that affect commercial power providers  particularly regulations related to the control of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change related matters  could affect the costs of commercial power  which may increase the costs of providing our services 

table of contents potential regulation of internet service providers in the united states could adversely affect our operations 
in the united states  the fcc has  to date  treated internet service providers as enhanced service providers 
in addition  congress has  to date  not sought to heavily regulate the provision of ip based services 
both congress and the fcc are considering proposals that involve greater regulation of ip based service providers 
depending on the content and scope of any regulations  the imposition of such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and the profitability of our services 
the communications industry is highly competitive with participants that have greater resources and a greater number of existing customers 
the communications industry is highly competitive 
many of our existing and potential competitors have financial  personnel  marketing and other resources significantly greater than ours 
many of these competitors have the added competitive advantage of a larger existing customer base 
in addition  significant new or increased competition could arise as a result of the consolidation in the industry  allowing foreign carriers to more extensively compete in the us market  further technological advances  and further deregulation and other regulatory initiatives 
if we are unable to compete successfully  our business could be significantly affected 
rapid technological changes can lead to further competition 
the communications industry is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology 
in addition  the introduction of new services or technologies  as well as the further development of existing services and technologies  may reduce the cost or increase the supply of certain services similar to those that we provide 
as a result  our most significant competitors in the future may be new entrants to the communications industry 
these new entrants may not be burdened by an installed base of outdated equipment or obsolete technology 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt in a timely manner to technological changes 
our international operations and investments expose us to risks that could materially adversely affect the business 
we have operations and investments outside of the united states  as well as rights to undersea cable capacity extending to other countries  that expose us to risks inherent in international operations 
these include general economic  social and political conditions  the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  tax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those in the us  foreign currency exchange rates may fluctuate  which could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our international assets and investments  foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions  
table of contents difficulties and costs of compliance with foreign laws and regulations that impose restrictions on our investments and operations  with penalties for noncompliance  including loss of licenses and monetary fines  difficulties in obtaining licenses or interconnection arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all  and changes in laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment 
we are exposed to significant currency exchange rate risks and currency transfer restrictions and our results may suffer due to currency translations and remeasurements 
certain of our current and prospective customers derive their revenue in currencies other than us dollars but are invoiced by us in us dollars 
the obligations of customers with substantial revenue in foreign currencies may be subject to unpredictable and indeterminate increases in the event that such currencies depreciate in value relative to the us dollar 
furthermore  these customers may become subject to exchange control regulations restricting the conversion of their revenue currencies into us dollars 
in either event  the affected customers may not be able to pay us in us dollars 
similarly  declines in the value of foreign currencies such as the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar discussed below relative to the us dollar could adversely affect our ability to market our services to customers whose revenue is denominated in those currencies 
in addition  where we issue invoices for our services in currencies other than us dollars  our net loss may suffer due to currency translations in the event that such currencies depreciate relative to the us dollar and we cannot or do not elect to enter into currency hedging arrangements in respect of those payment obligations 
we conduct a significant portion of our business using the british pound sterling  the euro and the brazilian real 
appreciation of the us dollar adversely affects our consolidated revenue 
since we tend to incur costs in the same currency in which those operations realize revenue  the effect on operating income and operating cash flow is largely mitigated 
however  if the us dollar appreciates significantly  future revenues  operating income and operating cash flows could be materially affected 
in addition  the appreciation of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies reduces the us dollar value of cash balances held in those currencies 
certain latin american economies have experienced shortages in foreign currency reserves and have adopted restrictions on the use of certain mechanisms to expatriate local earnings and convert local currencies into us dollars 
any of these shortages or restrictions may limit or impede our ability to transfer or to convert those currencies into us dollars and to expatriate those funds 
in addition  currency devaluations in one country may have adverse effects in another country 
in venezuela  the official bolivares us dollar exchange rate established by the venezuelan central bank bcv and the venezuelan ministry of finance has historically attributed to the bolivar a value significantly greater than the value that prevailed on the former unregulated parallel market 
the official rate is the rate used by the comisi n de administraci n de divisas cadivi  an agency of the venezuelan government  to exchange bolivares pursuant to an official process that requires application and government approval 
effective january   the venezuelan government devalued the venezuelan bolivar by increasing the official rate from venezuelan bolivares to the us dollar to for goods and services deemed non essential and for goods and services deemed essential 
effective january   the venezuelan government further increased the official rate for goods deemed essential to venezuelan bolivares to the us dollar 
effective february   the venezuelan government further devalued the venezuelan bolivar by increasing the official rate to venezuelan bolivares to the us dollar  except for a limited set of goods and services deemed essential that will temporarily continue to attract the rate 
we use the official rate for non essential goods and services to record the assets  liabilities and transactions of our venezuelan subsidiary 
in an attempt to control inflation  on may   the venezuelan government announced that the bcv would be given control over the previously unregulated portions of the exchange market 
in june  a new regulated currency trading system controlled by the bcv  the transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme  commenced operations and established an initial weighted average implicit 
table of contents exchange rate of approximately bolivares to the us dollar 
subject to the limitations and restrictions imposed by the bcv  entities domiciled in venezuela were permitted to access the sitme by buying us dollar denominated securities through banks authorized by the bcv 
sitme was intended to supplement the cadivi application and approval process with an additional process that allowed for quicker and smaller exchanges  albeit at a less favorable exchange rate 
however  in connection with the february  devaluation of the bolivar  the venezuelan government also announced that sitme will be eliminated 
the acquisition of foreign currency by venezuelan companies to honor foreign debt  pay dividends or otherwise expatriate capital is subject to the limitations and restrictions of the cadivi registration  application and approval process  and is also subject to the availability of foreign currency within the guidelines set forth by the national executive power for the allocation of foreign currency 
approvals under the cadivi process have been less forthcoming at times  resulting in a significant buildup of excess cash in our venezuelan subsidiary and a significant increase in our exchange rate and exchange control risks 
at december   we had million of obligations registered and subject to approval by cadivi for the conversion of bolivares into foreign currencies 
we cannot predict the timing and extent of any cadivi approvals to honor foreign debt  distribute dividends or otherwise expatriate capital using the official venezuelan exchange rate 
some approvals have been issued within a few months while others have taken more than one year 
in  we received million of approvals from cadivi to convert bolivares to us dollars at both the essential and non essential official rates 
as of december   our venezuelan subsidiary had million of net assets including million of cash and cash equivalents  of which million was held in us dollars and million was held in venezuelan bolivares 
in light of the venezuelan exchange control regime  none of these net assets other than the million of cash denominated in us dollars and held outside of venezuela may be transferred to level or any other subsidiary of level in the form of loans  advances or cash dividends without the consent of a third party that is  cadivi or sitme 
while the february  bolivar devaluation had no effect on our financial position or results of operations  the devaluation will affect our financial reporting starting with the first quarter of if enacted prior to december   this devaluation would have reduced our net monetary assets by million  including unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million  based on the bolivar balances as of december  the devaluation of our net monetary assets will result in a charge which will be recognized in other expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations in the first quarter of based on the bolivar balances as of december   the charge would be million 
the effects on revenue and operating income are not expected to be material in light of certain pricing adjustment mechanisms in many of our contracts with venezuelan customers and since most of our costs in venezuela are incurred in bolivares 
economic and political conditions in latin america pose numerous risks to our operations 
our business operations in the latin american region constitute a significant portion of our business 
as events in the latin american region have demonstrated  negative economic or political developments in one country in the region can lead to or exacerbate economic or political instability elsewhere in the region 
furthermore  events in recent years in other developing markets have placed pressures on the stability of the currencies of a number of countries in latin america in which we operate  including argentina  brazil  colombia and venezuela 
while certain areas in the latin american region have experienced economic growth  this recovery remains fragile 
pressures on local currencies are likely to have an adverse effect on our customers in this region 
volatility in regional currencies and capital markets could also have an adverse effect on our ability and that of our customers to gain access to international capital markets for necessary financing  refinancing and repatriation of earnings 
in addition  any changes to the political and economic conditions in certain latin american countries could materially and adversely affect our business 
for example  in january  the venezuelan national assembly issued an enabling law allowing the president of venezuela to carry out the nationalization of certain businesses in the electricity and energy sectors  as well as venezuela largest telecommunications company  compa a an nima 
table of contents nacional tel fonos de venezuela cantv 
cantv was nationalized in the same year 
a statement from the venezuelan minister of telecommunications and director of the comisi n nacional de telecomunicaciones  the country telecommunications regulatory authority  has indicated that the nationalization of cantv does not imply the nationalization of the telecommunications sector as a whole 
however  there can be no assurance that such nationalization plans will not also extend to other businesses in the telecommunications sector  including our business 
the government also announced plans to modify the telecommunications law  and we cannot predict the effect of these amendments to our business 
in addition  a referendum held on february   approved an amendment to the nation constitution removing presidential term limits 
inflation and certain government measures to curb inflation in some latin american countries may have adverse effects on their economies and our business and operations in those locations 
some latin american countries  including venezuela  brazil and argentina  have historically experienced high rates of inflation 
inflation and some measures implemented to curb inflation have had significant negative effects on the economies of these countries 
governmental actions taken in an effort to curb inflation  coupled with speculation about possible future actions  have contributed to economic uncertainty at times in most latin american countries 
these countries may experience high levels of inflation in the future that could lead to further government intervention in the economy  including the introduction of government policies that could adversely affect our results of operations in those locations 
in addition  if any of these countries experience high rates of inflation  we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures in those locations 
a high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business 
many of our most important uk government customers have the right to terminate their contracts with us if a change of control occurs or to reduce the services they purchase from us 
in various agencies of the uk government together represented approximately million  or approximately  of the core network services revenue for our emea region and approximately of our total consolidated core network services revenue 
many of these government contracts contain broad change of control provisions that permit the customer to terminate the contract if the level subsidiary that is a party to the agreement undergoes a change of control 
a termination in many instances gives rise to other rights of the government customer  including  in some cases  the right to purchase some of our assets used in servicing those contracts on terms that would be unfavorable to us 
in addition  most of these government contracts do not include significant minimum usage guarantees 
thus  the applicable customers could simply choose not to use our services and move to another telecommunications provider 
our agreements with certain agencies of the us government impose significant requirements on us 
a violation of those agreements could have severe consequences 
we are a party to an agreement with the us departments of homeland security  justice and defense addressing the us government national security and law enforcement concerns 
this agreement imposes significant requirements on us related to information storage and management  traffic management  physical  logical  and network security arrangements  personnel screening and training  and other matters 
we are also party to an agreement with the us department of defense addressing the us government national security concerns 
this agreement imposes significant requirements on us related to the composition and qualifications of the level communications  inc board of directors  the limitation of the influence or control over us of non us persons  physical  logical  and network security arrangements  and other matters 
while we expect to continue to comply fully with our obligations under both of the above mentioned agreements  it is impossible to eliminate completely the risk of a violation of either 
the consequences of a violation of these agreements could be severe  potentially including the revocation of our fcc licenses in the us  which 
table of contents would result in the cessation of our us operations  and or the loss of permissions required to do business with the us government 
we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and other anticorruption laws  and our failure to comply therewith could result in penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to the fcpa  which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business and or other benefits 
although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we  our employees and agents comply with the fcpa and other anticorruption laws  there can be no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability for actions taken by our agents  employees and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we acquire 
we currently operate and in the future may operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential anticorruption violations 
if we are not in compliance with the fcpa and other laws governing the conduct of business with government entities including local laws  we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures 
any investigation of any potential violations of the fcpa or other anticorruption laws by us or foreign authorities could have an adverse effect on our business 
the uk bribery act the bribery act reformed the united kingdom uk law in relation to bribery and corruption 
as well as containing provisions concerning bribery of public officials  the bribery act includes a criminal offense of failing to prevent bribery by relevant commercial organizations 
this offense applies when any person associated with the organization offers or accepts bribery anywhere in the world intending to obtain or retain a business advantage for the organization or in the conduct of business 
the bribery act has wide ranging implications in particular for business in the uk  including our subsidiaries 
however  it should be noted that it also has a wide ranging extra territorial effect 
the bribery act is broader in scope than the fcpa in that it directly addresses commercial bribery in addition to bribery of government officials and it does not recognize certain exceptions  notably facilitation payments that are permitted by the fcpa 
under the bribery act  it is a defense to the accusation of failure to prevent bribery for a commercial organization to show that it had in place adequate procedures designed to prevent such acts 
as with the fcpa  if we are not in compliance with the bribery act as well as similar laws in the uk or elsewhere that are applicable to our business  we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures 
risks related to our liquidity and financial resources disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our existing indebtedness on reasonable terms or at all  and have other adverse effects on us 
disruptions in the commercial credit markets could result in a tightening of credit markets 
the effects of recent credit market disruptions were widespread  and it is impossible to predict whether the improvement in the global credit markets will continue 
as a result of credit market turmoil  we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing or to refinance our existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all  which could affect our strategic operations and our financial performance and force modifications to our operations 
if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements  there would be a default under the terms of these agreements  and this could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that have been borrowed 
if we were unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in any of our debt agreements  there would be a default under the terms of those agreements 
as a result  borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions may also be accelerated and become due and payable 
if any of these events occur  there can be no assurance that we would be able to make necessary payments to the lenders or that we would be able to find alternative financing 
even if we were able to obtain alternative financing  there can be no assurance that it would be on terms that are acceptable 

table of contents if we experience a change in control or certain other events  we may be unable to satisfy our obligations to repurchase our outstanding notes as required under our outstanding debt agreements 
upon the occurrence of certain events defined in the various debt agreements relating to our outstanding debt  we are required to make an offer to purchase all of our outstanding notes at a purchase price generally equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon if any 
in addition  to the extent that we are required to make an offer to purchase one of the outstanding issues of our notes  the debt agreements relating to our other issues of notes may require us to repurchase that other debt upon a change in control or termination of trading 
we may not have or be able to borrow sufficient funds to pay the purchase price for all the notes tendered by holders seeking to accept the offer to purchase 
we have substantial debt  which may hinder our growth and put us at a competitive disadvantage 
our substantial debt may have important consequences  including the following the ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  working capital  investments and capital or other expenditures could be impaired or financing may not be available on acceptable terms  a substantial portion of our cash flows will be used to make principal and interest payments on outstanding debt  reducing the funds otherwise available for operations and future business opportunities  a substantial decrease in cash flows from operating activities or an increase in expenses could make it difficult to meet debt service requirements and force modifications to operations  having more debt than certain of our competitors may place us at a competitive disadvantage  and substantial debt may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally 
we had substantial deficiencies of earnings to cover fixed charges of approximately million  million and million for the fiscal year ended december   and  respectively 
we may not be able to repay our existing debt  failure to do so or refinance the debt could prevent us from implementing our strategy and realizing anticipated profits 
if we were unable to refinance our debt or to raise additional capital on acceptable terms  our ability to operate our business would be impaired 
as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately billion of long term debt on a consolidated basis after taking into account the repayment of our convertible senior notes due in january  as well as excluding debt discounts and fair value adjustments  and approximately billion of stockholders equity 
of the long term debt  approximately million is due to mature in  million is due to mature in and million is due in  in each case excluding debt discounts and fair value adjustments 
our ability to make interest and principal payments on our debt and borrow additional funds on favorable terms depends on the future performance of the business 
if we do not have enough cash flow in the future to make interest or principal payments on its debt  we may be required to refinance all or a part of our debt or to raise additional capital 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to refinance our debt or raise additional capital on acceptable terms 
restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements limit our ability to conduct our business and could prevent us from obtaining needed funds in the future 
our debt and financing arrangements contain a number of significant limitations that restrict our ability to  among other things 
table of contents borrow additional money or issue guarantees  pay dividends or other distributions to stockholders  make investments  create liens on assets  sell assets  enter into sale leaseback transactions  enter into transactions with affiliates  and engage in mergers or consolidations 
risks related to our common stock the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenue and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate 
the primary factors  among other things  that may affect our quarterly results include the following the timing of costs associated with the operation of our business and integration activities with respect to any completed acquisitions  demand for our services  loss of customers or the ability to attract new customers  changes in pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  changes in regulatory rulings  and general economic conditions as well as those specific to the communications and related industries 
a delay in generating revenue or the timing of recognizing revenue and expenses could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
it is possible that in some future quarters our results may be below analysts and investors expectations 
in these circumstances  the price of our common stock will likely decrease 
if certain transactions occur with respect to our capital stock  we may be unable to fully utilize our net operating loss carry forwards  or nols  to reduce our us federal income taxes 
as of december   we had nols of approximately billion for us federal income tax purposes after taking into account the effects of section of the internal revenue code 
if certain transactions occur with respect to our capital stock that result in a cumulative ownership change of more than percentage points by stockholders over a three year period as determined under rules prescribed by the us internal revenue code of  as amended the code and applicable regulations  annual limitations would be imposed with respect to our ability to utilize our nols and certain current deductions against any taxable income we achieve in future periods 

table of contents we have entered into transactions over the applicable three year period that  when combined with other changes in ownership that are outside of our control  have resulted in cumulative changes in the ownership of our capital stock 
additional transactions that we enter into  as well as transactions by existing stockholders and transactions by holders that become new stockholders that we do not participate in  could cause us to incur a percentage point ownership change by stockholders and  if we trigger the above noted code imposed limitations  such transactions would prevent us from fully utilizing nols and certain current deductions to reduce our us federal income taxes 
in addition  these limitations could cause us not to pursue otherwise favorable acquisitions and other transactions involving our capital stock  or could reduce the net benefits to be realized from any such transactions 
stt crossing significant ownership interest in level increases the risk that we could be unable to use our accumulated nols for us federal income tax purposes  and the rights agreement entered into by level designed to protect our ability to use our accumulated nols could discourage third parties from seeking strategic transactions with us that could be beneficial to our stockholders 
completion of the global crossing acquisition in particular stt crossing acquisition of a significant ownership interest in level moved us significantly closer to the ownership change described above and increases the likelihood of a loss of our nols 
in april  we entered into the rights agreement in an effort to deter acquisitions of our common stock that might reduce our ability to use our nols 
under the rights agreement  from and after the record date of april   each share of our common stock carries with it one preferred share purchase right that could discourage a third party from proposing a change of control or other strategic transaction concerning level or otherwise have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of level that other stockholders may view as beneficial 
under our certificate of incorporation  we are able to issue more shares of our common stock than are currently outstanding 
such future issuances of our common stock may have a dilutive effect on the earnings per share and voting power of our stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation  as currently in effect  authorizes us to issue to up to  shares of our common stock  which is a greater number of shares of common stock than are outstanding 
if our board of directors elects to issue additional shares of common stock in the future  whether in public offerings  in connection with mergers and acquisitions or otherwise  these additional issuances may dilute the earnings per share and voting power of our stockholders 
depending on the number of shares being issued and the particular circumstances involved  the board may be able to complete a particular issuance without further stockholder action 
anti takeover provisions in our charter and by laws could limit the share price and delay a change of management 
our restated certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult or even prevent a third party from acquiring us without the approval of our incumbent board of directors 
these provisions  among other things prohibit stockholder action by written consent in place of a meeting  limit the right of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  limit the right of stockholders to present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of stockholders  and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series without any action on the part of stockholders 

table of contents in addition  the terms of most of our long term debt require that upon a change in control  as defined in the agreements that contain the terms and conditions of the long term debt  we make an offer to purchase the outstanding long term debt at either or of the aggregate principal amount of that long term debt 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and significantly impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change management 
provisions and agreements that inhibit or discourage takeover attempts could reduce the market value of our common stock 
if a large number of shares of our common stock is sold in the public market  the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  future issuances by us of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  shares of our common stock that we issue in connection with an acquisition may not be subject to resale restrictions 
the market price of our common stock could drop significantly if certain large holders of our common stock  or recipients of our common stock in connection with an acquisition  sell all or a significant portion of their shares of common stock or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner 
in addition  these sales could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common stock in the capital markets 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and  in the future  the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to volatility and  in the future  the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors  including the depth and liquidity of the trading market for our common stock  quarterly variations in actual or anticipated operating results  changes in estimated earnings by securities analysts  market conditions in the communications and information services industries  announcement and performance by competitors  regulatory actions  and general economic conditions 
in addition  market fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the market price or liquidity of our common stock 
other risks environmental liabilities from our historical operations could be material 
there could be environmental liabilities arising from historical operations of our predecessors  for which we may be liable 
our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  human health and safety 
these laws and regulations include those concerning the use and management of hazardous and non hazardous substances and wastes 
we have made and will continue to make significant expenditures relating to our environmental compliance obligations 
despite our best efforts  we may not at all times be in compliance with all of these requirements 

table of contents in connection with certain historical operations  we have responded to or been notified of potential environmental liability at approximately properties as of january  we are engaged in addressing or have liquidated environmental liabilities at of those properties 
of these a we have formal commitments or other potential future costs at sites  b there are sites with unknown future costs  and c there are sites with no likely future costs 
the remaining properties have been dormant for several years 
we could potentially be held liable  jointly or severally  and without regard to fault  for the costs of investigation and remediation of these sites 
the discovery of additional environmental liabilities related to historical operations or changes in existing environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are now exposed to legal proceedings and contingent liabilities that could result in material losses that we have not reserved against 
we are party to various legal proceedings and are subject to certain important contingent liabilities described more fully in note  commitments  contingencies and other items  to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k  many of which involve global crossing 
if one or more of these legal proceedings or contingent liabilities were to be resolved in a manner adverse to us  we could suffer material losses 
global crossing did not establish reserves for many of these contingent liabilities and those for which reserves were established could be adversely resolved at levels exceeding the reserved amounts 
certain of these contingent liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition to the effect of any potential monetary judgment or sanction against us 
furthermore  any legal proceedings  regardless of the outcome  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
assets and entities that global crossing acquired in its most recent acquisitions may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse  or only limited recourse to the entity from which the business was acquired or its stakeholders 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may adversely affect the financial markets and our business 
there can be no assurance that there will not be future terrorist attacks 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly affect our physical facilities or those of our customers 
these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the us and world financial markets and economy 
any of these occurrences could materially adversely affect our business 
the pension plans previously maintained by global crossing and with respect to our operations before may require additional funding and negatively affects cash flows 
certain north american and european hourly and salaried employees of global crossing are covered by defined benefit pension plans 
on december   the north american plan was frozen and all employees hired thereafter are not eligible to participate in the plan 
the uk plans were closed to new employees on december  the pension expense and required contributions to these pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets  the projected rate of return on plan assets  the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation under these pension plans and the pension plans with respect to non global crossing operations prior to was approximately million million for us plans and million for us plans and the value of plan assets was approximately million approximately million for us plans and million for uk plans  resulting in these pension plans being underfunded by million 
if plan assets perform below expectations  future pension expense and funding obligations will increase  which would have a negative effect on our cash flows from operations

the table below sets forth  for the calendar quarters indicated  the high and low per share sales prices of our common stock as reported by the nasdaq global select market from january  to october  and the nyse composite tape from october  to december   and all of  as adjusted for the reverse stock split noted above 
year ended december  high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year ended december  high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter equity compensation plan information 
we have two equity compensation plans under which we may issue shares of our common stock to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
they are the level communications  inc stock plan and the global crossing limited stock incentive plan 
we assumed sponsorship of the global crossing limited stock incentive plan in connection with the acquisition of global crossing 
options outstanding under the global crossing limited stock incentive plan at the closing of the acquisition were automatically exchanged for options to purchase shares of our common stock and the plan was amended to provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock 
the following table provides information about the shares of our common stock that may be issued upon exercise of awards under the level communications  inc stock plan in the equity compensation plans approved by stockholders category and the global crossing limited stock incentive plan in the equity compensation plans not approved by stockholders category as of december  
table of contents plan category number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options  warrants and rights weighted average exercise price of outstanding options  warrants and rights number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans equity compensation plans approved by stockholders equity compensation plans not approved by stockholders includes  among other awards  awards of outperform stock appreciation units osos 
for purposes of this table  each oso is considered to use a single share of our common stock from the total number of shares reserved for issuance under the level communications  inc stock plan even though the actual payout multiplier may range from zero to four  as described below 
at december   the only type of award outstanding under the level communications  inc stock plan that included an exercise price was the osos 
the weighted average exercise price indicated is for the outstanding osos at the date of grant 
the exercise price of an oso is subject to change based upon the performance of our common stock relative to the performance of the s p index from the time of the grant of the award until the award has been exercised 
includes awards of options only 
the global crossing limited stock incentive plan provides for the granting of i stock options  ii stock appreciation rights and iii other stock based awards  including  without limitation  restricted share units  to eligible participants 
the vesting of outstanding awards may be accelerated and the securities issuable pursuant to outstanding awards may be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain corporate events 
no awards may be granted under the plan after december  for additional information about the plan  see note  employee benefits and stock based compensation to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
osos are currently designed to provide recipients of the awards with the incentive to maximize stockholder value and to reward recipient employees only when the price of our common stock outperforms the s p index between the date of grant and the date that the oso is settled 
osos have a three year life and vest on the third anniversary of the date of the award and will fully settle on that date 
in other words  recipients of osos are not able to voluntarily exercise the osos as they will settle automatically with value on the third anniversary of the date of the award or expire without value on that date 
this type of instrument is sometimes referred to as a european style option 
osos have an initial strike price that is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date of grant 
this initial strike price is referred to as the initial price 
on the settlement date  the initial price is adjusted as of that date by a percentage that is equal to the aggregate percentage increase or decrease in the s p index over the period beginning on the date of grant and ending on the trading day immediately preceding the settlement date 
the initial price  however  cannot be adjusted below the closing price of our common stock on the day that the oso was granted 
the value of all osos will increase as the price of our common stock increases relative to the performance of the s p index over time 
this increase in value is attributable in part to the use of a success multiplier 
the mechanism for determining the value of an individual oso award is described as follows 
the initial price is adjusted over time the adjusted strike price until the settlement date 
the adjustment is an amount equal to the percentage appreciation or depreciation in the value of the s p index from the date of grant to the settlement date 
the value of the oso increases for increasing levels of outperformance 
osos have a multiplier 
table of contents range from zero to four depending upon the performance of our common stock relative to the s p index as shown in the following table 
if level stock outperforms the s p index by then the pre multiplier gain is multiplied by a success multiplier of or less more than but less than outperformance percentage multiplied by or more the pre multiplier gain is our common stock price minus the adjusted strike price on the settlement or exercise date

table of contents offerings are not considered to be compatible with the delivery of the company services or with meeting its financial objectives  level may exit those lines of business or stop offering those services in part or in whole 
the successful integration of acquired businesses into level is important to the success of level the company must identify synergies and integrate acquired networks and support organizations  while maintaining the service quality levels expected by customers to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition

the company will continue to look for opportunities to improve its financial position and focus its resources on growing revenue and managing costs for the business 
revenue by service offering year ended december  dollars in millions core network services north america wholesale channel north america enterprise channel emea wholesale channel emea enterprise channel emea uk government channel latin america wholesale channel latin america enterprise channel total core network services wholesale voice services and other total revenue total revenue consists of core network services revenue from colocation and data center services  transport and fiber  ip and data services  and voice services excluding wholesale voice services 
wholesale voice services and other revenue from sales to other carriers of long distance voice services  revenue from managed modem and its related intercarrier compensation services and revenue from the sbc master services agreement  which was obtained through an acquisition in core network services revenue represents higher margin services and wholesale voice services and other revenue represents lower margin services 
core network services revenue requires different levels of investment and focus and provides different contributions to the company operating results than wholesale voice services and other revenue 
management of level believes that growth in revenue from its core network services is critical to the long term success of its business 
the company also believes it must continue to effectively manage gross margin contribution from the wholesale voice services component and the positive cash flows from the other revenue component of wholesale voice services and other revenue 
the company believes that trends in its communications business are best gauged by analyzing revenue changes in core network services 
core network services growth in transport such as private line and wavelengths and fiber revenue is largely dependent on increased demand for bandwidth services and available capital of companies requiring communications capacity for their own use or in providing capacity as a service provider to their customers 
these expenditures may be in the form of monthly payments or  in the case of private line  wavelength or dark fiber services  either monthly payments or up front payments 
the company is focused on providing end to end transport and fiber services to its customers to directly connect customer locations with a private network 
pricing for end to end metropolitan transport services have been relatively stable 
for intercity transport and fiber services  the company continues to experience pricing pressure in locations where a large number of carriers co locate their facilities 
an increase in demand may be offset by declines in unit pricing 

table of contents colocation and data center services allow customers to place their network equipment and servers in suitable environments maintained by the company with high speed links providing on net access to more than countries 
these services are secure  redundant and flexible to fit the varying needs of the company customers 
services  which vary by location  include hosting network equipment used to transport high speed data and voice over level s global network  providing managed it services  installation  maintenance  storage and monitoring of enterprise services  and providing comprehensive it outsource solutions 
ip and data services primarily include the company high speed internet protocol ip  dedicated internet access dia  virtual private network vpn  content delivery network cdn  media delivery  vyvx broadcast  converged business network  asynchronous transfer mode atm and frame relay services 
level s ip and high speed ip service is high quality and is offered in a variety of capacities 
the company vpn service permits businesses of any size to replace multiple networks with a single  cost effective solution that greatly simplifies the converged transmission of voice  video  and data 
this convergence to a single platform can be obtained without sacrificing the quality of service or security levels of traditional atm and frame relay offerings 
vpn service also permits customers to prioritize network application traffic so that high priority applications  such as voice and video  are not compromised in performance by the flow of low priority applications such as email 
voice services comprise a broad range of local and enterprise voice services using voip and traditional circuit switch based technologies  including voip enhanced local service  sip trunking  local inbound service  primary rate interface service  long distance service and toll free service 
for financial reporting purposes  the company voice services also include its comprehensive suite of audio  web and video collaboration services 
the company believes that one of the largest sources of future incremental demand for the company core network services will be from customers that are seeking to distribute their feature rich content or video over the internet 
revenue growth in this area is dependent on the continued increase in demand from customers and the pricing environment 
an increase in the reliability and security of information transmitted over the internet and declines in the cost to transmit data have resulted in increased utilization of e commerce or web based services by businesses 
although the pricing for data services is currently relatively stable  the ip market is generally characterized by price compression and high unit growth rates depending upon the type of service 
the company experienced price compression in the high speed ip and voice services markets in  which is expected to continue in the following provides a discussion of the company core network services revenue in terms of the enterprise and wholesale channels 
the enterprise channel includes large  multi national enterprises requiring large amounts of bandwidth to support their business operations  such as financial services companies  healthcare companies  content providers  and portal and search engine companies 
it also includes medium sized enterprises and regional service providers who buy services regionally or locally  as well as government markets  including the us federal government  the systems integrators supporting the us federal government  us state and local governments  academic consortia  and certain academic institutions 
included in the enterprise channel  but broken out separately in the table above  is the uk government channel  which includes revenue primarily from the government sector in the uk the wholesale channel includes revenue from incumbent and alternative carriers in each of the regions  global carriers  wireless carriers  cable companies  satellite companies  and voice service providers 
the company believes that the alignment of core network services around channels should allow it to drive growth while enabling it to better focus on the needs of its customers 
each of these channels is supported by dedicated employees in sales 
each of these channels is also supported by non dedicated  centralized service delivery and management  product management and development  corporate marketing  global network services  engineering  information technology  and corporate functions  including legal  finance  strategy and human resources 

table of contents wholesale voice services and other the company offers wholesale voice services that target large and existing markets 
the revenue potential for wholesale voice services is large  however  the pricing and margins are expected to continue to decline over time as a result of the new low cost ip and optical based technologies 
in addition  the market for wholesale voice services is being targeted by many competitors  several of which are larger and have more financial resources than the company 
the company also has other revenue derived from mature services that are not critical areas of emphasis for the company  including revenue from managed modem and its related intercarrier compensation services and sbc contract services  which includes revenue from the sbc master services agreement  which was obtained in the december acquisition of wiltel communications group  llc 
the company and its customers continue to see consumers migrate from narrow band dial up services to higher speed broadband services as the narrow band market matures 
the company is in the process of discontinuing managed modem services and has notified all current managed modem customers of this decision 
the company expects ongoing declines in the other revenue component of wholesale voice services and other similar to what has been experienced over the past several years 
the company receives compensation from other carriers when it terminates traffic originating on those carriers networks 
this intercarrier compensation is based on interconnection agreements with the respective carriers or rates mandated by the federal communications commission fcc 
the company has interconnection agreements in place for the majority of traffic subject to intercarrier compensation 
along with addressing other matters  on november   the fcc established a prospective intercarrier compensation framework for terminating switched access and voice over internet protocol voip traffic  with elements of it becoming effective beginning on december  under the framework  most terminating switched access charges and all intercarrier compensation charges are capped at current levels  and will be reduced to zero over  as relevant to level  a six year transition period beginning july  several states  industry groups  and other telecommunications carriers filed petitions in federal court for reconsideration of the framework with the fcc  although the outcome of those petitions is unpredictable 
a majority of the company existing intercarrier compensation revenue is associated with agreements that have expired terms  but remain effective in evergreen status 
as these and other interconnection agreements expire  the company will continue to evaluate simply allowing them to continue in evergreen status so long as the counterparty allows the same or negotiating new agreements 
the company earns intercarrier compensation revenue from providing managed modem services  which are declining 
the company also receives intercarrier compensation from its voice services 
in this case  intercarrier compensation is reported within core network services revenue 
revenue reporting in  the company is maintaining its current reporting of revenue by service offering as disclosed in the table above but will be making some adjustments between current geographical and channel reporting categories to more accurately reflect the revenue attribution by region 
additionally  the company will make some minor customer channel changes and reallocate core network services voice services revenue attributable to its reseller customers to wholesale voice services and other revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company evaluates 
table of contents these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while the company has other accounting policies that involve estimates such as the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  and unfavorable contracts recognized in purchase accounting  management has identified the policies below  which require the most significant judgments and estimates to be made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
revenue revenue for communications services  including colocation and data center services  transport and fiber  ip and data services  voice services and managed modem  is recognized monthly as the services are provided based on contractual amounts expected to be collected 
communications services are provided either on a usage basis  which can vary period to period  or at a contractually committed amount 
intercarrier compensation revenue is recognized when an interconnection agreement is in place with another carrier  or if an agreement has expired  when the parties have agreed to continue operating under the previous agreement until a new agreement is negotiated and executed  or at rates mandated by the fcc 
for certain sale and long term indefeasible right of use iru contracts involving private line  wavelengths and dark fiber services  the company may receive up front payments for services to be delivered for a period of up to years 
in these situations  the company defers the revenue and amortizes it on a straight line basis to earnings over the term of the contract 
termination revenue is recognized when a customer disconnects service prior to the end of the contract period and for which level had previously received consideration and for which revenue recognition was deferred 
termination revenue also is recognized when customers make termination penalty payments to level to settle contractually committed purchase amounts that the customer no longer expects to meet or when a customer and level renegotiate a contract under which level is no longer obligated to provide product or services for consideration previously received and for which revenue recognition has been deferred 
termination revenue is reported in the same manner as the original product or service provided 
accounting practice and guidance with respect to the accounting treatment of revenue continues to evolve 
any changes in the accounting treatment could affect the manner in which the company accounts for revenue within its business 
revenue reserves the company establishes appropriate revenue reserves at the time services are rendered based on an analysis of historical credit activity to address  where significant  situations in which collection is not reasonably assured as a result of credit risk  potential billing disputes or other reasons 
the company significant estimates are based on assumptions and other considerations  including payment history  credit ratings  customer financial performance  history of billing disputes and industry financial performance 
cost of revenue for communications services the company disputes incorrect billings from its suppliers of network services 
the most prevalent types of disputes include disputes for circuits that are not disconnected by the supplier on a timely basis and usage bills with incorrect or inadequate information 
depending on the type and complexity of the issues involved  it may and often does take several quarters to resolve the disputes 
the company establishes appropriate cost of revenue reserves for disputed supplier billings based on an analysis of its historical experience in resolving disputes with its suppliers 

table of contents in determining the amount of the cost of network service expenses and related accrued liabilities to reflect in its financial statements  the company considers the adequacy of documentation of disconnect notices  compliance with prevailing contractual requirements for submitting these disconnect notices and compliance with its interconnection agreements with these carriers 
judgment is required in estimating the ultimate outcome of the dispute resolution process  as well as any other amounts that may be incurred to conclude the negotiations or settle any litigation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences could be material 
non cash compensation the company recognizes stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards in accordance with fair value recognition provisions 
under the fair value recognition provisions  the company recognizes stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate  recognizing compensation cost for only those awards expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and estimating the fair value of share based payment awards require subjective assumptions  including the assumption for stock price volatility for outperform stock options and the achievement of performance criteria for performance based awards 
the company estimates the stock price volatility using a combination of historical and implied volatility  as level believes it is consistent with the approach most marketplace participants would consider by using all available information to estimate expected volatility 
the company has determined that expected volatility is more reflective of market conditions and provides a more accurate indication of volatility than using solely historical volatility 
in reaching this conclusion  the company has considered many factors including the extent to which its future expectations of volatility over the respective term is likely to differ from historical measures  the absence of actively traded options for the company common stock and the company ability to review volatility of its publicly traded convertible debt with similar terms and prices to the options the company is valuing 
the company issues outperform stock options in which the value received is based on a formula involving a multiplier related to the level by which the company common stock outperforms the s p index 
the company utilizes a modified black scholes model due to the additional variables required to calculate the effect of the success multiplier for its outperform stock options  including estimating the expected volatility of the s p index 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company uses different assumptions  stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if actual forfeiture rates are materially different from the company estimate  stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current period 
valuation of long lived assets the company performs an assessment of its long lived assets  including finite lived acquisition related intangible assets  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets or asset groupings may not be recoverable 
this review requires the identification of the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of grouping assets subject to review 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flows includes long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and operating expenses 
all of these items require significant judgment and assumptions 
an impairment loss may exist when the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the long lived asset carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management assumptions and projections 
the company conducted a long lived asset impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of and and in each case concluded that its long lived assets  including its finite lived acquisition related intangible assets  were not impaired 
to the extent that future changes in assumptions and estimates cause a change in estimates of future cash flows that indicate the carrying amount of the company long lived assets  including finite lived acquisition related 
table of contents intangible assets  may not be recoverable  the company may incur impairment charges in the future to write down the carrying amount of the company long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
useful lives of long lived assets the company performs periodic internal reviews to evaluate the depreciable lives of its property  plant and equipment 
due to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment  selecting the estimated economic life of telecommunications property  plant  and equipment requires a significant amount of judgment 
the company internal reviews take into account input from the company global network services personnel regarding actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history  and assumptions regarding the benefits and costs of implementing new technology that factor in the need to meet the company financial objectives 
in connection with the acquisition of global crossing  in the company evaluated the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets and determined that the period it expected to use conduit  fiber  and certain transmission equipment was longer than the remaining useful lives originally estimated 
in determining the change in estimated useful lives  the company  with input from its engineering team  considered its historical usage patterns and retirements  estimates of technological obsolescence  and expected usage and maintenance 
the change in the estimated useful lives of conduit  fiber  and certain transmission equipment resulted in a reduction of depreciation expense of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  which was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate on a prospective basis effective october  under the accounting standard related to changes in accounting estimates applied to pre existing and acquired conduit  fiber  and transmission equipment 
goodwill the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its goodwill at the end of the fourth quarter  or more frequently if the company determines that indicators of impairment exist 
the company impairment review process considers the fair value of each reporting unit relative to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step must be performed  and the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
in accordance with recently issued accounting guidance  prior to performing the two step evaluation  an assessment of qualitative factors may be performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value 
if it is determined that it is unlikely that the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the company is not required to complete the two step goodwill impairment evaluation 
the selection and assessment of qualitative factors used to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value involves significant judgments and estimates 
in  the company reporting units consist of its three regional operating units in north america  europe  the middle east and africa emea  and latin america 
goodwill assigned to the north america  emea and latin america reporting units at december  totaled billion and was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
in  the company reporting units were consistent with its two reportable segments 
goodwill assigned to the level and global crossing reportable segments at december  totaled billion and was billion and billion  respectively 
in and  the company conducted its goodwill impairment analysis using a qualitative assessment and determined it was not necessary to complete the two step goodwill impairment evaluation and that its goodwill was not impaired 
as of december   the fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value 
to the extent that future changes in the company assumptions and estimates cause a change in the related fair value estimates that indicate the carrying amount of the company goodwill may not be recoverable  the company 
table of contents may incur impairment charges in the future to write down the carrying amount of the company goodwill to its estimated fair value 
asset retirement obligations the company asset retirement obligations consist of legal requirements to remove certain of its network infrastructure at the expiration of the underlying right of way row term and restoration requirements for leased facilities 
the initial and subsequent measurement of the company asset retirement obligations require the company to make significant estimates regarding the eventual costs and probability or likelihood that the company will be required to remove certain of its network infrastructure and restore certain of its leased properties 
in addition  the company must estimate the periods over which these costs will be incurred and the present value of such costs using the company estimate of its credit adjusted risk free interest rate upon initial recognition 
as a result of a strategic review of the company real estate portfolio in the fourth quarter of  the company completed an updated analysis and revised its estimated future cash flows of its asset retirement obligations 
the analysis required estimating the probability or likelihood that the company will be required to remove certain of its network infrastructure and restore leased properties  and the timing and amount of eventual costs 
the analysis resulted in the downward revision of the company asset retirement obligation liability 
this change in the estimated cash flows resulted in a non cash gain of million recorded within selling  general and administrative expense  and depreciation expense 
in conjunction with its review of the row obligation  the company identified an error in its assumptions used to estimated its row obligation related to the extension of the useful lives of its conduit assets effective october  see note organization and summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company recorded a non cash benefit of approximately million recorded within selling  general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter of for the change in the row term used to estimate its row obligation 
the reduction in the asset retirement obligations liability includes the change in estimate of the row term that arose in prior periods  which did not materially affect any of the company previously reported results of operations or financial condition  or the current period results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of the total revisions in estimated amount and timing of cash flows for asset retirement obligations  the company reduced its asset retirement obligations liability by million with an offsetting reduction to property  plant and equipment of million  selling  general and administrative expenses of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
the company first reduced property  plant and equipment to the extent of the carrying amount of the related asset initially recorded when the asset retirement obligations were established 
the amount of the remaining reduction to the asset retirement obligations were recorded as a reduction to depreciation expense to the extent of historical deprecation of the related asset and then to selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company periodically evaluates its asset retirement obligations to determine if the amount and timing of its cash flow estimates continue to be appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
assessment of loss contingencies the company has legal  tax and other contingencies that could result in significant losses upon the ultimate resolution of such contingencies 
the company has provided for losses in situations where its has concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
further  with respect to loss contingencies  where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and there is a range in the expected loss and no amount in the range is more likely than any other amount  the company accrues at the low end of the range 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining whether a loss is probable and reasonably estimable due to the uncertainty involved in predicting the likelihood of future events and estimating the financial impact of such events 
accordingly  it is possible that upon the further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a significant charge could be recorded in a future period related to an existing contingent matter 
for additional 
table of contents information  see note commitments  contingencies and other items in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
business combinations the accounting guidance for business combinations requires an acquiring entity to recognize all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value 
the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from global crossing and the related estimated lives of depreciable tangible and identifiable intangible assets requires a significant amount of judgment and is considered a critical estimate 
such allocation of certain aspects of the purchase price to items that are more complex to value is performed by management  taking into consideration information provided to management by an independent valuation firm

adjusted ebitda is not a measurement under generally accepted accounting principles gaap and may not be used in the same way by other companies 
management believes that adjusted ebitda is an important part of the company s internal reporting and is a key measure used by management to evaluate profitability and operating performance of the company and to make resource allocation decisions 
management believes such measurement is especially important in a capital intensive industry such as telecommunications 
management also uses adjusted ebitda to compare the company s performance to that of its competitors and to eliminate certain non cash and non operating items in order to consistently measure from period to period its ability to fund capital expenditures  fund growth  service debt and determine bonuses 
adjusted ebitda excludes non cash impairment charges and non cash stock compensation expense because of the non cash nature of these items 
adjusted ebitda also excludes interest income  interest expense and income tax benefit expense because these items are associated with the company s capitalization and tax structures 
adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non cash expenses reflect the effect of capital investments which management believes are better evaluated through cash flow measures 
adjusted ebitda excludes net other income expense because these items are not related to the primary operations of the company 
there are limitations to using non gaap financial measures such as adjusted ebitda  including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from the company s calculations 
additionally  this financial measure does not include certain significant items such as interest income  interest expense  income tax benefit expense  depreciation and amortization expense  non cash impairment charges  non cash stock compensation expense and net other income expense

as of december   the company had borrowed a total of approximately billion primarily under a senior secured term loan excluding discounts and floating rate senior notes due that bear interest at libor rates plus an applicable margin 
as the libor rates fluctuate  so too will the interest expense on amounts borrowed under the debt instruments  unless libor rates are below the minimum libor rate for a particular senior secured term loan 
the weighted average interest rate on the variable rate instruments at december   was approximately 

table of contents in march  level financing entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest payments on billion notional amount of floating rate debt

a decline in interest rates in the future will not generally benefit the company with respect to the fixed rate debt due to the terms and conditions of the indentures relating to that debt that would require the company to repurchase the debt at specified premiums if redeemed early 
indicated changes in interest rates are based on hypothetical movements and are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
future earnings and losses will be affected by actual fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts a portion of its business in currencies other than the us dollar  the currency in which the company consolidated financial statements are reported 
accordingly  the company operating results could be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate volatility relative to the us dollar 
the company european subsidiaries and certain latin american subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency  as the majority of their revenue and purchases are transacted in their local currencies 
although the company continues to evaluate strategies to mitigate risks related to the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the company will likely recognize gains or losses from international transactions 
changes in foreign currency rates could adversely affect the company operating results
