item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes thereto 
this report contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following the planned opening of approximately new american eagle outfitters stores in north america and internationally during fiscal  the success of our efforts to expand internationally in mexico and asia  engage in future franchise license agreements  and or growth through acquisitions or joint ventures  the selection of approximately to american eagle outfitters stores in the united states and canada for remodeling and refurbishing during fiscal  the potential closure of approximately to american eagle outfitters and to aerie stores in the united states and canada during fiscal  the planned opening of approximately new franchised american eagle outfitters stores during fiscal  the success of our core american eagle outfitters and aerie brands through our omni channel outlets within north america and internationally  
table of contents the expected payment of a dividend in future periods  the possibility that our credit facilities may not be available for future borrowings  the possibility that rising prices of raw materials  labor  energy and other inputs to our manufacturing process  if unmitigated  will have a significant impact to our profitability  and the possibility that we may be required to take additional store impairment charges related to underperforming stores 
we caution that these forward looking statements  and those described elsewhere in this report  involve material risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on factors beyond our control  as discussed within part i  item a of this form k 
accordingly  our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statement 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ from these estimates 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believe them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue for store sales upon the purchase of merchandise by customers 
our e commerce operation records revenue upon the estimated customer receipt date of the merchandise 
revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase  and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns and deductions for coupon redemptions and other promotions 
the estimated sales return reserve is based on projected merchandise returns determined through the use of historical average return percentages 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we estimate gift card breakage and recognize revenue in proportion to actual gift card redemptions as a component of total net revenue 
we determine an estimated gift card breakage rate by continuously evaluating historical redemption data and the time when there is a remote likelihood that a gift card will be redeemed 
we recognize royalty revenue generated from our franchise agreements based upon a percentage of merchandise sales by the franchisee 
this revenue is recorded as a component of total net revenue when earned 
merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  utilizing the retail method 
average cost includes merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses 
the company records merchandise receipts at the time merchandise is delivered to the foreign shipping port by the manufacturer fob port 
this is the point at which title and risk of loss transfer to us 
we review our inventory in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear merchandise 
additionally  we estimate a markdown reserve for future planned markdowns related to current inventory 
if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in 
table of contents customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price  additional markdowns may be necessary 
these markdowns may have a material adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
we estimate an inventory shrinkage reserve for anticipated losses for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve is calculated based on historical percentages and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory shrinkage reserve 
however  if actual physical inventory losses differ significantly from our estimate  our operating results could be adversely affected 
asset impairment 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc  property  plant  and equipment  we evaluate long lived assets for impairment at the individual store level  which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of the assets 
when events such as these occur  the impaired assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded separately as a component of operating income under loss on impairment of assets 
our impairment loss calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  our operating results could be adversely affected 
investment securities 
in accordance with asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  we measure our investment securities using level  level and level inputs 
level and level inputs are valued using quoted market prices 
in the event we hold level investments  we would use a discounted cash flow dcf model to assess fair value of our level investments 
the assumptions in our dcf model include different recovery periods depending on the type of security and varying discount factors for yield and illiquidity 
these assumptions are subjective and they are based on our current judgment and our view of current market conditions 
the use of different assumptions could result in a different valuation 
we evaluate our investments for impairment in accordance with asc  investments debt and equity securities asc 
asc provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
if  after consideration of all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of its investment  impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
additionally  asc requires additional disclosures relating to debt and equity securities both in the interim and annual periods as well as requires us to present total other than temporary impairment otti with an offsetting reduction for any non credit loss impairment amount recognized in other comprehensive income oci 
share based payments 
we account for share based payments in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation asc 
to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the expected term and the estimated volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term 

table of contents we calculate a weighted average expected term based on historical experience 
expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility 
we chose to use a combination of historical and implied volatility as we believe that this combination is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of our share based payments and the related amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we calculate income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as computed pursuant to asc deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates  based on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance  in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
changes in our level and composition of earnings  tax laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as the results of tax audits  may materially impact the effective income tax rate 
we evaluate our income tax positions in accordance with asc which prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
under asc  a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits 
the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the decision to recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position and to establish a valuation allowance require management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that our assumptions and estimates are reasonable  although actual results may have a positive or negative material impact on the balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities  valuation allowances or net income 
key performance indicators our management evaluates the following items  which are considered key performance indicators  in assessing our performance comparable sales comparable sales provide a measure of sales growth for stores and channels open at least one year over the comparable prior year period 
in fiscal years following those with weeks  including fiscal  the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks 
a store is included in comparable sales in the thirteenth month of operation 
however  stores that have a gross square footage increase of or greater due to a remodel are removed from the comparable sales base  but are included in total sales 
these stores are returned to the comparable sales base in the thirteenth month following the remodel 
sales from american eagle outfitters and aerie stores  as well as sales from aeo direct  are included in total comparable sales 
sales from franchise stores are not included in comparable sales 
individual american eagle outfitters and aerie brand comparable sales disclosures represent sales from stores only 
sales from aeo direct are included only in total comparable sales and not included at the american eagle outfitters and aerie brand levels 
we began to include aeo direct sales in the comparable sales metric in fiscal for the following reasons comparable sales is a key industry operating metric focused on evaluating and understanding sales earned by a retailer s established outlets over a given time period  aeo direct is an established outlet and has a comparable prior period sales amount similar to a comparable store  
table of contents our approach to customer engagement is omni channel  which provides a seamless customer experience through both traditional and non traditional channels  including four wall store locations  web  mobile tablet devices  social networks  email  in store displays and kiosks  shopping behavior has evolved across multiple channels that work in tandem to meet all customer needs 
for example  a customer can place an aeo direct order within a store location  which will be fulfilled by aeo direct 
additionally  returns are accepted at multiple locations ie  aeo brand stores  aerie stores or aeo direct  regardless of origin of the sale  and are recorded as a reduction to sales at the location of the return 
as a result  from a customer s perspective  channels are increasingly blurred  and while industry practice varies  there has been a move to report e commerce sales within the comparable sales metric 
our management considers comparable sales to be an important indicator of our current performance 
comparable sales results are important to achieve leveraging of our costs  including store payroll  store supplies  rent  etc 
comparable sales also have a direct impact on our total net revenue  cash and working capital 
gross profit gross profit measures whether we are optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise and achieving an optimal level of sales 
gross profit is the difference between total net revenue and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs  as well as markdowns  shrinkage  certain promotional costs and buying  occupancy and warehousing costs 
buying  occupancy and warehousing costs consist of compensation  employee benefit expenses and travel for our buyers and certain senior merchandising executives  rent and utilities related to our stores  corporate headquarters  distribution centers and other office space  freight from our distribution centers to the stores  compensation and supplies for our distribution centers  including purchasing  receiving and inspection costs  and shipping and handling costs related to our e commerce operation 
merchandise margin is the difference between total net revenue and merchandise costs  which exclude buying  occupancy and warehousing costs 
the inability to obtain acceptable levels of sales  initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations 
operating income our management views operating income as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable sales  gross profit  our ability to control selling  general and administrative expenses  and our level of capital expenditures 
management also uses earnings before interest and taxes ebit as an indicator of successful operating results 
return on invested capital our management uses return on invested capital roic as a key measure to assess our efficiency at allocating capital to profitable investments 
this measure is critical in determining which strategic alternatives to pursue 
store productivity store productivity  including total net revenue per average square foot  sales per productive hour  average unit retail price aur  conversion rate  the number of transactions per store  the number of units sold per store and the number of units per transaction  is evaluated by our management in assessing our operational performance 
inventory turnover our management evaluates inventory turnover as a measure of how productively inventory is bought and sold 
inventory turnover is important as it can signal slow moving inventory 
this can be critical in determining the need to take markdowns on merchandise 
cash flow and liquidity our management evaluates cash flow from operations  investing and financing in determining the sufficiency of our cash position 
cash flow from operations has historically been sufficient to cover our uses of cash 
our management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
our management s goals are to drive improvements to our gross profit performance  bring greater consistency to our results and to deliver profitable growth over the long term 
specifically  our planned near term financial targets are to deliver a total net revenue compounded annual growth rate cagr of to  an ebit cagr of to and a roic in the range of to  annually 

table of contents results of operations overview in  we made significant progress on our near term goals

total comparable sales for the week year increased over the corresponding week period last year  with positive comparable sales in all quarters of the year 
for the year  aeo brand comparable sales increased  aerie brand increased  and aeo direct increased 
throughout the year  strong merchandise improvements led to comparable sales growth across the assortment 
the strength of our brand  combined with a more distinct lifestyle point of view  is broadening our customer appeal 
lower product costs  improved markdown rates and better inventory management led to a higher gross margin in fiscal gross margin expanded basis points to  compared to last year 
operating income for the year was million  which includes million in restructuring and store impairment charges 
income from continuing operations was per diluted share this year  compared to income from continuing operations of per diluted share last year 
on an adjusted basis  income from continuing operations this year was per diluted share  which excludes a per diluted share impact from restructuring and impairment costs and a per diluted share tax benefit from audit settlements 
this compares to adjusted income from continuing operations last year of per diluted share  which excludes an per diluted share impact from restructuring and impairment costs 
the preceding paragraph contains non gaap financial measures non gaap or adjusted  comprised of earnings per share information excluding non gaap items 
this financial measure is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
we believe that this non gaap information is useful as an additional means for investors to evaluate our operating performance  when reviewed in conjunction with our gaap financial statements 
these amounts are not determined in accordance with gaap and therefore  should not be used exclusively in evaluating our business and operations 
the table below reconciles the gaap financial measure to the non gaap financial measure discussed above 
for the fiscal years ended february  january  income from continuing operations per diluted share gaap basis add restructuring and impairment costs less tax benefits income from continuing operations per diluted share non gaap basis restructuring and impairment costs for the weeks ended february  consist of million of pre tax asset impairments and asset write offs for the aeo and aerie brands and million of pre tax severance and related employee costs 
restructuring and impairment costs for the weeks ended january  consist of million of pre tax store asset impairment charges for the aeo and aerie brands and million of pre tax executive transition costs 
tax benefits for the weeks ended february  consist of million of benefits from federal and state audit settlements 
we ended fiscal with million in cash and short term investments  a decrease of million from last year  which primarily reflects cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases of million  partially offset by cash generated from operations 
during the year  we generated million

fair value measurements asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under asc as the exit price associated with the sale of an asset or transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date financial instruments valuation techniques used to measure fair value under asc must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
in addition  asc establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the tiers include level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 

table of contents level unobservable inputs ie  projections  estimates  interpretations  etc 
that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
as of february   we held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
these include cash equivalents and short term investments 
in accordance with asc  the following table represents the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets cash equivalents and investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of february  fair value measurements at february  in thousands carrying amount quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level cash and cash equivalents cash money market commercial paper total cash and cash equivalents short term investments treasury bills term deposits total short term investments total percent to total in the event we hold level investments  we would use a discounted cash flow dcf model to assess fair value 
refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our investment securities  including a description of the securities 
liquidity and capital resources our uses of cash are generally for working capital  the construction of new stores and remodeling of existing stores  information technology upgrades  distribution center improvements and expansion  the purchase of short term investments and the return of value to shareholders through the repurchase of common stock and the payment of dividends 
historically  these uses of cash have been funded with cash flow from operations and existing cash on hand 
additionally  our uses of cash include the development of the aerie brand and our international expansion efforts 
we expect to be able to fund our future cash requirements in north america through current cash holdings as well as cash generated from operations 
in the future  we expect that our uses of cash will also include further expansion of our brands internationally 
our growth strategy includes fortifying our brands and the further international expansion or acquisitions 
we periodically consider and evaluate these options to support future growth 
in the event we do pursue such options  we could require additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in closing any potential transaction  or that any endeavor we undertake would increase our profitability 

table of contents the following sets forth certain measures of our liquidity february  january  working capital in s current ratio the million decrease in our working capital and corresponding decrease in the current ratio as of february  compared to january   related primarily to our use of cash for investing and financing activities  offset by net income  net of non cash adjustments
