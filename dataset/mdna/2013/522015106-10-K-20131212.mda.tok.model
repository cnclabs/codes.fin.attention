overview nature of the business 
learning tree international is a leading worldwide vendor independent provider of training and education to business and government organizations for their it professionals and managers 
since our founding in  we have provided high quality training to over million it professionals and managers 
in fiscal year  while presenting courses in countries  we trained  course participants from more than  organizations  including large national and multinational companies  government organizations  and small and medium size companies 
as of september   we offered a broad proprietary library of intensive instructor led courses from one to five days in length  consisting of different course titles representing  hours of training  including it course titles and management course titles 
learning tree courses provide both breadth and depth of education and training across a wide range of technical and management disciplines  including operating systems  databases  computer networks  computer and network security  web development  programming languages  software engineering  open source applications  project management  business skills  leadership and professional development 
we market and present our courses through locally staffed operations in the united states  the united kingdom  france  canada  sweden and japan and generate approximately half of our revenues outside of the united states 
we coordinate  plan and deliver our courses at our own education centers  external hotel and conference facilities and customer sites worldwide 
our proprietary live online learning platform  learning tree anyware  allows individuals located anywhere in the world to use their internet browser to participate online in instructor led classes being conducted live in learning tree education centers or at customer locations 
we use a well defined systematic approach to develop and update the learning tree course library so as to provide training that is immediately applicable by course participants to their work in a broad range of applications and industries 
after assessing market need  courses are translated into french  swedish and japanese 
our proprietary course development process also allows us to customize our courses to specific customer requirements for delivery at their sites 
we design our own vendor independent it courses to provide participants an unbiased perspective regarding software and hardware products and the ability to compare and integrate multiple platforms and technologies from various vendors 
all learning tree courses are highly interactive  and incorporate extensive hands on exercises or case study workshops 
our it courses are designed around highly practical hands on exercises that provide participants with extensive in class experience mastering the tools and techniques they can apply immediately upon returning to their jobs 
similarly  many of our management courses utilize our innovative proprietary learning methodology that provides an environment in which course participants learn entirely by doing through extensive multi media simulations 
throughout these courses  participants gain extensive experience applying new management skills in life like  challenging situations  within the confines of the classroom and under the guidance of an expert instructor 
as a result  course participants can achieve greater mastery of effective management techniques as well as the confidence needed to apply them  and thus return to their jobs both ready and willing to immediately apply their expanded skills in their workplaces 
we had instructors as of september   who are practicing professionals with expert subject knowledge  and who average over years of hands on  real world experience 
learning tree instructors teach an average of approximately course events per year on an as needed basis 
when they are not teaching  learning tree instructors use and hone their it and management skills either as full time employees for other companies or as independent consultants 
we have structured our business so that over half of our course delivery costs are variable and depend primarily upon the number of course events conducted 
we schedule our course events throughout the year based on our assessment of demand 
since learning tree instructors typically work full time or as consultants for other business and industry employers  or in the case of management instructors as industry consultants and facilitators  they teach our course events as needed and thus  our instructor related costs are largely variable 
however  expenses associated with our own education centers and course equipment are largely fixed 
we adjust our expenditures for sales and marketing depending on our strategic objectives  which generally include an assessment of our expectations for influencing future customer demand  market conditions and other factors 
however  if our expectations regarding the results of our marketing efforts prove to be wrong  any significant revenue shortfall would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as we have for the past years  we continue to emphasize excellence in educating and training it professionals and managers from government and commercial organizations around the world 
we believe that quality is a significant differentiator in the eyes of our customers  and that our proven long term record of exceptional performance is a reason for our clients tremendous loyalty 
every one of our largest clients five years ago in fiscal year was still one of our clients five years later in fiscal year we continue our emphasis on excellence by focusing on our core strengths our expert instructors  proprietary content library  state of the art classrooms  application of technology to education  and worldwide course delivery systems 
we follow a or week fiscal year 
our year end and quarter end dates are on the friday nearest the end of the calendar quarter 
accordingly  our fiscal year ended on september  and our fiscal year ended on september  our fiscal years and each consisted of weeks 
results of operations the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated expressed as percentages of revenues fiscal year ended september  september  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses course development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations other expenses  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss fiscal year compared with fiscal year in fiscal year  our world wide revenues decreased to million from million in fiscal year loss from operations was million in fiscal year compared to million in net loss for fiscal year was million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal year revenues 
our fiscal year revenues decreased by compared to fiscal year the decrease in revenues primarily resulted from a decrease in the number of course participants and a reduction in average revenue per participant 
the decrease in revenues was situated in both our north america and european operations 
changes in foreign exchange rates reduced revenues by  predominately impacting our operation in japan 
revenues in north america of million in fiscal decreased compared to million in fiscal year for north america operations  average revenue per participant dropped while the number of participants decreased year over year 
the decrease in average revenue per participant in north america year over year was primarily the result of lower prices realized from participants attending under a special  more heavily discounted passport program  which started in our fourth quarter of fiscal and largely ended june  the decrease in the number of participants in north america in fiscal year was primarily caused by the us government s enactment of sequestration resulting in automatic reductions to government agency spending which reduced the number of participants from the us government and related government contractors 
revenues from the u 
s 
government and government contractors who purchased courses under our government contract schedules totaled million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year additionally  the number of north american participants in fiscal year was negatively impacted by hurricane sandy which disrupted our east coast  especially our new york  operations during our first quarter of fiscal year revenues from our european operations decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year exchange rates negatively impacted year over year european revenues by less than 
for european operations  average revenue per participant increased and the number of participants decreased 
the decrease in the number of participants in our european operations for fiscal year is the result of the continued adverse effects of the european economies 
during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training worldwide  a decrease of from  attendee days in fiscal year in our it courses during fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of it training worldwide  a decrease from  attendee days in fiscal year in our management courses in fiscal year  we provided  attendee days of training worldwide  an decrease from  attendee days in fiscal year cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues primarily includes the variable costs of course instructors and their travel expenses  course materials  refreshments and freight  and the fixed costs of course equipment and classroom facilities 
during fiscal year  we presented  events  less than the  events during fiscal year this resulted from our efforts over the past year to adjust our course scheduling  and thus to increase both the number of participants per event and the percentage of events that run as scheduled 
as a result of these efforts  the average number of participants per event rose to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  and the percentage of advertised events that we ran also increased substantially 
our cost of revenues for fiscal year increased to million from million in fiscal year our cost of revenues as a percentage of our revenues increased to for fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year was due to the increase in the average cost per event  partially offset by a increase in revenue per event 
the increase in our cost per event was primarily the result of higher instructor costs  increased depreciation expense related to the replacement of classroom equipment in the later part of fiscal  and the apportionment of higher fixed costs related to our education centers over fewer events 
as a result  gross profit declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal year changes in exchange rates do not materially affect our gross profit percentages since exchange rates have essentially the same impact on both revenues and cost of revenues in any time period 
course development expenses 
we maintain a disciplined process to develop new courses and update our existing courses 
all costs incurred in that process  principally for internal product development staff and for subject matter experts  are expensed when incurred and are included in course development expenses 
during fiscal year  course development expenses were of revenues compared to during fiscal year in fiscal year  we decreased our overall spending on course development by to million compared with million in fiscal year this million decrease includes million in lower rent costs due to the closure of the los angeles office 
the remaining million reflected a decrease in activities associated with new course development and existing course revisions compared to the prior year 
we introduced new it course titles in fiscal year  the same number that we added in fiscal year during fiscal year we introduced new management courses compared with in fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  the learning tree library of instructor led courses numbered titles  comprising  hours of training  compared with titles at the end of fiscal year the decrease in the number of titles in fiscal year reflected the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
in general  titles are retired when the profits they generate no longer justify the ongoing cost of marketing them and maintaining their content 
thus  we may or may not develop more titles than we retire in any period 
at september   we had it titles in our course library  compared with at the end of fiscal year our library of management titles numbered as of september   compared with management titles at the end of fiscal year sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include the cost of designing  producing and distributing direct mail and media advertisements  marketing e mails and our website  compensation and travel related costs for sales and marketing personnel  and the cost of information systems to support these activities 
our sales and marketing expenses were of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal year sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the overall decrease of million was primarily due to decreases of million in decreased personnel and benefits costs resulting from the world wide sales force reduction implemented at the end of fiscal year  and a million decrease in direct marketing and advertising expenses 
on a year over year basis  changes in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact our sales and marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal year compared to of revenues in fiscal year we reduced general and administrative expenses by million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the overall decrease was due to decreases of million in lower salary and benefit costs  million in lower severance expense  million reduced bank credit card fees  and million in lower depreciation and amortization costs 
these decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by a million increase in professional service costs primarily resulting from an unsuccessful attempt to privatize the company during fiscal year other income expense  net 
other income expense  net in fiscal year remained essentially unchanged year over year at expense of million in fiscal years and income taxes 
in fiscal year  our income tax provision was million compared to million in fiscal year our effective rate for fiscal year was compared to in fiscal year the effective rate for fiscal year is primarily related to us federal  state and foreign taxes 
the effective rate for fiscal year was primarily attributable to the valuation allowance we recorded against our deferred tax assets as a result of experiencing a net loss for in the third quarter of we established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the united states and france due to current year and projected future pre tax book losses 
this valuation allowance has been maintained to date 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether any deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carry forwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized 
realization is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a deferred tax liability for federal income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately million of our international subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of september  based on future forecasts and budgets  we plan to repatriate cash from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states 
this deferred tax liability is offset by deferred tax assets in the united states  therefore  the net impact to tax expense for fiscal year is only the of foreign withholding taxes 
geographic data learning tree education centers are located in six countries and we have historically derived roughly half of our revenues from outside the united states 
the north america operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to revenues of million in fiscal year revenues from our european operations were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year our asian operations recorded revenues of million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on segment reporting 
although our consolidated financial statements are stated in us dollars  all of our subsidiaries other than in the united states have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
gains and losses arising from the translation of the balance sheets of our subsidiaries from the functional currencies to us dollars are reported as adjustments to stockholders equity 
fluctuations in exchange rates may also have an effect on our results of operations 
since both revenues and expenses are generally denominated in the subsidiary s local currency  changes in exchange rates that have an adverse effect on our foreign revenues are partially offset by a favorable effect on our foreign expenses  and vice versa 
the impact of future exchange rates on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to date  we have not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore we continue to be subject to such risks 
in the future  we may undertake such hedging transactions 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques we might implement would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
inflation in fiscal year  inflation did not have a significant impact on our net sales  revenues and income from continuing operations 
changing prices  mainly due to larger discounting as a result of the reimplementation of the unlimited passport product  contributed to the reduction in revenue per attendee for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year see the discussion on revenues above 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu  which provides guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the standard requires entities to present either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements the effects of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income on income statement line items 
asu was effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 income taxes topic presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists asu 
the standard provides that a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit would be offset against a deferred tax asset instead of presented gross for a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward if such settlement is required or expected in the event the uncertain tax position is disallowed 
asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted  and may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the adoption date 
the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb including the emerging issues task force  the american institute of certified public accountants and the sec did not  or management believes will not  have a material impact on our present or future consolidated financial statements 
quarterly results of operations historically  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated  and that is expected to continue in the future 
typically  our first and third fiscal quarters have higher revenues and income from operations than do our second and fourth fiscal quarters 
the fluctuations may be caused by many factors such as i the frequency of course events  ii the number of weeks during which courses can be conducted in a quarter  iii the timing  timely delivery  frequency and size of and response to our direct mail marketing and advertising campaigns  iv the timing of our introduction of new course titles  v the mix between course events held at customer sites and course events held in our education centers and hotels due to differing gross profit margins  vi competitive forces within markets we serve  vii our ability to attract customers and meet their expectations  viii currency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations  ix natural disasters  external strikes  acts of war or terrorism and other external factors  and x general economic conditions and industry specific slowdowns 
fluctuations in quarter to quarter results also occur as a result of differences in the timing of our spending on the marketing and development of our courses and for seasonal factors 
our quarterly revenues and income fluctuate due to the seasonal spending patterns of our customers  which are affected by factors including i cyclic or one time budgetary considerations  ii factors specific to their business or industry  iii weather  holiday and vacation considerations  and iv other considerations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for our unaudited quarterly financial data for the eight fiscal quarters ended september  our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity at september  included cash and cash equivalents on hand of million 
during fiscal year  the total of our cash and cash equivalents increased by million primarily as a result of sales of available for sale securities totaling million offset by cash used in operations of million and million used for capital expenditures 
cash flows 
our cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at september  from million at september  fiscal year ended net change september  september  vs 
cash used in operating activities cash used in provided by investing activities cash used in financing activities effects of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash used in operating activities totaled million in fiscal year as compared to cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal year cash provided by investing activities totaled million during fiscal year compared to cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal year the change was the result of sales of available for sale securities of million in fiscal year as compared to net purchases of available for sale securities of million in fiscal and million in lower capital expenditures for purchases of equipment and other capital assets during fiscal cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year this change was primarily due to the repurchases of common stock in fiscal the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during fiscal year was million the same as in fiscal year in fiscal year  free cash flow  which we define as net cash used in operating activities plus purchases of equipment  property and leasehold improvements was a negative million 
this compares to a negative million of free cash flow in fiscal year the change in free cash flow for fiscal year is primarily due to a million decrease in purchases of capital expenditures partially offset by a million increase of cash used in operating activities 
we believe that free cash flow is useful for investors to understand our liquidity 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure and accordingly should be considered only as a supplement to  and not a replacement of  cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity 
the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities computed in accordance with gaap fiscal year september  september  cash used in operating activities less purchases of equipment  property and leasehold improvements free cash flow liquidity 
at september  our working capital current assets minus current liabilities was million  a million decrease from our working capital balance at september  the change in working capital was primarily due to the net loss for the year of million and purchases of property  plant and equipment during the year of million partially offset by million of non cash depreciation and amortization expense and the return of million of lease deposits related to the london  uk education center property 
we have no outstanding debt or line of credit agreements 
we anticipate we will continue to rely primarily on our balance of cash and cash equivalents on hand including the possible repatriation of cash from our foreign subsidiaries  cash flows from operations  and other financing available to us to finance our operating cash needs 
we believe that such funds will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for our fiscal year capital requirements 
during fiscal year  we made capital expenditures of million for the purchase of equipment worldwide  mostly computers and other equipment for use in our courses 
the capital spending in fiscal year was to replace equipment in order to provide our customers with up to date technologies when participating in our courses 
we plan to continue to invest in our infrastructure to accommodate any increased customer demand  to continue improving the quality and effectiveness of our course delivery and to incorporate significant changes in technology 
we have a number of operating leases for our administrative offices and education center classroom facilities located worldwide 
these leases expire at various dates over the next eight years 
in addition to requiring monthly quarterly payments for rent  some of the leases contain asset retirement provisions whereby we are required to return the leased facility back to a specified condition at the expiration of the lease 
we record the expense for these asset retirement obligations ratably over the life of the lease 
we have no asset retirement payments coming due in fiscal year off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting estimates and policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following list of critical accounting estimates and policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting estimates and policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition 
we offer our customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a learning tree training passport 
a learning tree training passport allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of courses over a one to two year period for a fixed price 
during fiscal year  we re introduced for a limited time the unlimited training passport which allows an individual passport holder to attend as many courses as they want  before the expiration date 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue recognized for each course attendance is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken  the weighted average list price of all courses taken and the estimated average number of courses all passport holders will actually attend 
upon expiration of each individual training passport  we record the difference  if any  between the revenues previously recognized and that specific training passport s total invoiced price 
the estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average number of course events that training passport holders have been attending 
the actual training passport attendance rate is reviewed at least semi annually  and if the training passport attendance rates change  the revenue recognition rate for active training passports and for training passports sold thereafter is adjusted prospectively 
we believe it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to most closely match revenue and related costs  as the substantial majority of our passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their training passports 
we believe that the use of recent historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by passport holders 
the average actual attendance rate for all expired training passports has closely approximated the estimated rate we utilize 
although we have seen no material changes in the historical rates as the number of course titles has changed  we monitor such potential effects 
in general  determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a training passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future 
these estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue 
if the estimates are wrong  we would record the difference between the revenues previously recognized for that training passport and the training passport selling price upon expiration of that training passport 
thus  the timing of revenue recognition may be affected by an inaccurate estimation  but the inaccuracy would have no effect on the aggregate revenue recognized over the one to two year life of each training passport 
for newer passport products for which historical utilization data is not available  we assume that the estimated average number of courses to be attended is equal to the number of courses available on the passport 
for the recently re introduced unlimited passport  we utilize historical data to estimate the expected number of courses that will be attended 
these assumed utilization rates may be revised in future periods after sufficient time has passed to amass additional historical trends 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
we use estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  based on our analysis of various factors  including our historical collection experience  current trends  specific identification of invoices which are considered doubtful and a percentage of our past due accounts receivable 
although our estimates for this reserve have in the past been reasonably accurate  these estimates could differ from actual collection experience and are subject to adjustment 
our trade accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible 
lease termination costs 
we lease education center and administrative office space under various operating lease agreements 
certain of these operating leases include space that is not used and that is currently subleased 
we calculate and record a liability related to those leases based on the difference between the present value of the net aggregate sublease rental income and the present value of the prime lease costs for the subleased space throughout the remaining term of the leases 
periodically  we evaluate the nature and extent of each of the individual provisions and make adjustments as appropriate  as new information becomes available or subsequent developments occur 
when space is vacant from time to time  we must estimate the fair value of the liability for the vacant space based upon the remaining lease costs as defined by our operating lease agreement reduced by estimated future sublease rental income that could be reasonably obtained for the property based upon prevailing real estate market conditions 
the computed short and long term portions of such liabilities are recorded as deferred facilities rent and other in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
amounts are paid under the master lease to the landlord  netted against subtenant sublease receipts  and applied to our accrued lease liability  reducing the amount of liability recorded with an offset to general and administrative expenses 
asset retirement obligations 
we record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated future cost to retire an asset 
for us  most asset retirement obligation aro liabilities are primarily associated with education facilities leasehold improvements which  at the end of a lease  we are obligated to remove in order to restore the facility back to a condition specified in the lease agreement 
at the inception of such a lease  we record the aro as a liability and also record a leasehold improvement asset in an amount equal to the fair value of the liability 
the capitalized leasehold improvement asset is then depreciated on a straight line basis over years or the term of the lease  whichever is shorter 
any difference between the actual costs incurred for the eventual retirement and the estimated liability previously recorded will be recognized as a gain or loss in our statement of operations at the termination of the lease 
the fair value of any such aro liability is estimated in three steps the costs of leasehold restoration are estimated as if they were to be performed at the inception of the lease  the cost is forecast into the future by applying an inflation rate in effect at the time of adoption together with a market risk premium for a contractor s risk for performing the work in the future  and the present value of this future cost is computed by discounting it at our credit worthiness interest rate determined at the inception of the lease 
the aro liability is subsequently increased annually by interest accretion throughout the term of the lease 
in future periods we may also make adjustments to the aro liability as a result of the availability of new information  technology changes  changes in labor costs and other factors 
the estimate of the aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment 
we cannot predict what revisions to these assumptions will be required in future periods 
the aro liability is based on a number of assumptions requiring professional judgment 
these include estimates for expected future cash flows related to contractual obligations  primarily to restore leased space back to open floor layouts as required by the lease agreements  our credit adjusted risk free rate that considers our estimated credit rating as of the date of lease inception  the market risk premium that we determine based on the length of the individual leases  and the relevant inflation factor in each affected country 
for the more significant aros we obtain third party restoration estimates specific to those leases 
we cannot predict the type of revisions to these assumptions that will be required in future periods due to the availability of additional information  technology changes  the price of labor costs and other factors 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
asc prescribes the use of the asset and liability method to compute the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts  using currently enacted tax laws 
if necessary  a valuation allowance is established  based on the weight of available evidence  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  is principally dependent upon achievement of sufficient future taxable income 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to examination by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the impact on our deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes in income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates or future taxable income levels  among other things  could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
see critical accounting estimates for significant policies on revenue recognition 
in addition to our learning tree training passports  we also offer a multiple course sales discount referred to as learning tree training vouchers 
with learning tree training vouchers  a customer buys the right to send a specified number of attendees to learning tree courses over a six to twelve month period for a fixed price 
revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance 
for the majority of training vouchers with unused seats at the expiration of the voucher  we record the pro rata selling price of the expired unused seats as revenue 
at times we make a business decision to extend the life of a training voucher beyond the normal twelve month expiration date 
training vouchers purchased under government rate schedules have no expiration date 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by assumptions regarding a number of variables including our expected stock price volatility  expected term and risk free interest rates 
we analyzed our historical volatility to estimate the expected volatility 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on the us treasury rate at the date of grant  which most closely resembles the expected life of our options 
the estimated expected life represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and has been determined based on the simplified method under asc we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated pre vesting forfeitures 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
the estimated forfeiture rate used for fiscal years and was zero 
long lived assets 
we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets  such as equipment  property and leasehold improvements  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in making such evaluations  we compare the expected future cash flows to the carrying amount of the assets 
if the total of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the long lived assets in order to calculate the impairment loss equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets 
we make significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  such as estimating cash flows  remaining useful lives  discount rates and growth rates 
the resulting cash flows are computed over an extended period of time  which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the valuation of long lived assets 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes under the provisions of fasb asc  income taxes 
deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the basis reported in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
outlook effect of exchange rates 
approximately half of our business annually is conducted in currencies other than us dollars and fluctuations in exchange rates will affect future revenues and expenses when translated into dollars 
if the exchange rates as of december  remain constant for the remainder of our first quarter of fiscal year  we would expect to report a favorable effect of approximately on our revenues during our first quarter of fiscal year compared to the same quarter of fiscal year of course  we would also see an unfavorable effect from exchange rates on our overall expenses  though this effect is less pronounced because more of our expenses are denominated in us dollars  including our corporate management and centralized it  marketing and course development activities which are located here in the united states 
first quarter revenues 
we currently expect revenues for our first quarter of fiscal year of between million and million  compared to revenues of million in our first quarter of fiscal year first quarter gross profit 
we expect a gross profit percentage in our first quarter of fiscal year of between and compared to in our first quarter of fiscal year first quarter operating expenses 
we expect overall operating expenses for our first quarter of fiscal year to be between million and million  compared to million in our first quarter last year 
first quarter income loss from operations 
as a result of the above factors  we expect to experience a first quarter of fiscal year of operating results of between a loss of million and income of million compared with a million operating loss in our first quarter of fiscal year first quarter other income  net 
we expect first quarter other income expense  net to be less than million 
first quarter pre tax income loss 
overall  we expect to report pre tax income loss for our first quarter of fiscal year of between a loss of million and income of million  compared to a pre tax loss of million in the first quarter of fiscal year item a
