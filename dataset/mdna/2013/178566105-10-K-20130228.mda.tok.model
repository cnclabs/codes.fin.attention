competition there is significant competition among commercial banks and other financial institutions in the company market areas 
california  new york  nevada  tennessee and georgia are highly competitive environments for banks and other financial organizations that provide private and business banking and wealth management services 
the company faces competitive credit and pricing pressure as it competes with other banks and financial organizations 
the company performance is also significantly influenced by california economy 
as a result of the glb act  the company also competes with other providers of financial services such as money market mutual funds  securities firms  credit unions  insurance companies and other financial services companies 
furthermore  interstate banking legislation has promoted more intense competition by eroding the geographic constraints on the financial services industry

we believe this relationship banking approach and specialized knowledge provide a business advantage in providing high client satisfaction and serving the small to mid sized businesses  entrepreneurs  professionals and other affluent individuals that comprise the company client base 
our ability to compete also depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain our senior management and other key colleagues 
further  our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and market new and innovative products and services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products and services 
economic conditions  government policies  legislation and regulation the company earnings and profitability  like most financial institutions  are highly sensitive to general business and economic conditions 
these conditions include the yield curve  inflation  available 
table of contents money supply  the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  fluctuations in both debt and equity markets  and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we conduct business 
energy and commodity prices are additional primary sources of risk and volatility 
the company financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  is highly dependent upon the business environment in the states of california  nevada  new york  tennessee and georgia  and in the united states as a whole 
while the united states is showing signs of recovery from the recent economic crisis  it is not certain that conditions will continue to improve and could worsen 
unemployment levels are improving but remain high 
uncertainty regarding continued economic improvement could lead to decreased consumer confidence and spending which could have a negative impact on our clients businesses and in turn on our business 
the company can be negatively affected by changes in the financial performance of our clients and borrowers including through decreased loan utilization rates  increased delinquencies and defaults and changes to our customers ability to meet certain credit obligations 
while real estate values have shown signs of improvement  declines in commercial real estate and housing values could have a negative impact on the value of collateral securing loans 
in addition  unresolved federal budget negotiations and the level of united states debt may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets 
europe and other global economies face continued economic stresses including increasing debt levels  that could impact the capital markets generally  including the company ability to access capital and the trading price of the company securities 
in general  the difference between the interest rates paid by the bank on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rates received by the bank on its interest earning assets  such as loans extended to its clients and securities held in its investment portfolio  comprise the major portion of the company earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the company control  such as inflation  recession  and unemployment 
see item a risk factors 
the company business and earnings are further affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and its agencies  particularly the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve 
the federal reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve are its open market operations in us government securities  including adjusting the required level of reserves for depository institutions subject to its reserve requirements  and varying the target federal funds and discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions 
the actions of the federal reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments  and deposits and also affect interest rates earned on interest earning assets and paid on interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the policies of the federal reserve may have an effect on the company business  results of operations and financial condition 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies  and other financial institutions and financial services providers are frequently introduced in the us congress  in the state legislatures  and before various regulatory agencies 
the likelihood and timing of any proposals or legislation and the impact they may have on the company cannot be determined at this time 
supervision and regulation general the corporation  the bank and the corporation non banking subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state law 
these regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors  the deposit insurance fund  and the banking system as a whole  and not for the 
table of contents protection of shareholders of the corporation 
set forth below is a summary description of the significant laws and regulations applicable to the corporation and the bank 
the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations 
regulatory agencies the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and its other subsidiaries 
as a financial holding company and a bank holding company  the corporation is regulated under the bank holding company act of the bhc act  and is subject to supervision  regulation and inspection by the federal reserve 
the corporation is also under the jurisdiction of the sec and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended  each administered by the sec 
the corporation is listed on the new york stock exchange nyse under the trading symbol cyn and is subject to the rules of the nyse for listed companies 
the bank  as a national banking association  is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight extending to all of its operations by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  its primary regulator  and also by the federal reserve  the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb and the federal depository insurance corporation fdic 
the corporation non bank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the federal reserve and other federal and state agencies  including for those non bank subsidiaries that are investment advisors  by the sec under the investment advisors act of the company registered broker dealers are regulated by the sec  the financial industry regulatory authority and state securities regulators 
the corporation the corporation is a bank holding company and a financial holding company 
in general  the bhc act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking  managing or controlling banks and other activities that the federal reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
as a result of the glb act  which amended the bhc act  bank holding companies that are financial holding companies may engage in any activity  or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity  that is either i financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity as determined by the federal reserve in consultation with the occ or ii complementary to a financial activity  and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally as determined solely by the federal reserve 
activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing  insurance underwriting and agency  and making merchant banking investments 
currently  if a bank holding company seeks to engage in the broader range of activities that are permitted under the bhc act for financial holding companies  i all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized and well managed and ii it must file a declaration with the federal reserve that it elects to be a financial holding company 
a depository institution subsidiary is considered to be well capitalized if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the section captioned capital adequacy and prompt corrective action  included elsewhere in this item 
a depository institution subsidiary is considered well managed if it received a composite rating and management rating of or on a scale of  with being the highest rating in its most recent examination 
in addition  the subsidiary depository institution must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the cra 
see the section captioned community reinvestment act included elsewhere in this item 
under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act  bank holding companies  as well as their depository institution subsidiaries  are also required to be well capitalized and well managed in 
table of contents order to engage in the broader range of activities that are permitted under the bhc act for financial holding companies 
financial holding companies that do not continue to meet all of the requirements for such status  depending on which requirement they fail to meet  may not be able to undertake new activities or acquisitions that are financial in nature  or may lose the ability to continue those activities that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies 
in addition  failure to satisfy conditions prescribed by the federal reserve to comply with any such requirements could result in orders to divest banking subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the bhc act 
the bhc act  the federal bank merger act  and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks 
the bhc act requires the prior approval of the federal reserve for the direct or indirect acquisition of control of a commercial bank or its parent holding company  whether by i the acquisition of percent or more of any class of voting securities  ii controlling the election of a majority of the directors  or iii the exercise of a controlling influence over the management or policies of the banking organization  which can include the acquisition of as little as percent of any class of voting securities together with other factors 
under the federal bank merger act  the prior approval of the occ is required for a national bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank 
in reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions  the bank regulatory authorities will consider  among other things  the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions  the capital position of the combined organization  the applicant performance record under the cra see the section captioned community reinvestment act included elsewhere in this item  fair housing laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities 
under the dodd frank act  bank regulatory authorities also review the potential risks of the transaction to the stability of the us banking system or financial system 
source of strength doctrine federal reserve policy requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and does not permit a bank holding company to conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner 
under this source of strength doctrine  a bank holding company is expected to stand ready to use its available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity  and to maintain resources and the capacity to raise capital that it can commit to its subsidiary banks 
any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment of deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks 
the bhc act provides that  in the event of a bank holding company bankruptcy  any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 
in addition  under the national bank act  if the capital stock of the bank is impaired by losses or otherwise  the occ is authorized to require payment of the deficiency by assessment upon the corporation 
if the assessment is not paid within three months  the occ could order a sale of the bank stock held by the corporation to satisfy the deficiency 
furthermore  the federal reserve has the right to order a bank holding company to terminate any activity that the federal reserve believes is a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any subsidiary bank 
the dodd frank act codifies the source of strength doctrine 
the bank the occ has extensive examination  supervision and enforcement authority over all national banks  including the bank 
if  as a result of an examination of a bank  the occ determines that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other 
table of contents aspects of the bank operations are unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation  various remedies are available to the occ 
these remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced  to direct an increase in capital  to restrict the growth of the bank  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors  and ultimately to terminate the bank deposit insurance 
the occ  as well as other federal banking agencies  has adopted regulations and guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards  including but not limited to such matters as loan underwriting and documentation  risk management  internal controls and audit systems  interest rate risk exposure  asset quality and earnings and compensation and other employee benefits 
various other requirements and restrictions under the laws of the united states affect the operations of the bank 
statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the bank operations  including reserves against deposits  ownership of deposit accounts  interest rates payable on deposits  loans  investments  mergers and acquisitions  borrowings  dividends  locations of branch offices  and capital requirements 
the dodd frank act the dodd frank act  which was signed into law on july   has had  and will continue to have  a broad impact on the financial services industry  imposing significant regulatory and compliance changes  increased capital  leverage and liquidity requirements and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of the financial services sector 
the dodd frank act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations  and to prepare numerous studies and reports for congress 
the federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the rules and regulations  and  as a result  many of the details and much of the impact of the dodd frank act may not be known for many months or years 
the dodd frank act significantly restructures the financial services regulatory scheme  including through the expansion of the scope of oversight responsibility of certain federal agencies and through the creation of new oversight bodies 
for example  the dodd frank act established the cfpb with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the cfpb has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions and non bank financial institutions  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority over all banking and non banking financial organizations with more than billion in assets 
the dodd frank act also created the financial stability oversight council which is charged with identifying risks to financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure  or ongoing activities  of nonbank financial companies and which could recommend to the federal reserve increasingly strict rules for capital  leverage  liquidity  risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity 
the dodd frank act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce state and federal consumer protection laws 
the dodd frank act impacts  among other things  the way financial services companies do business  the cost of doing business and capital standards applicable to financial services companies 
for example  the dodd frank act requires that all insured depository institutions and their holding companies be subject to the same generally applicable risk based capital and leverage rules  which led to the removal of trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a holding company tier capital and other comprehensive revisions to regulatory capital rules  including the basel iii capital standards discussed further below 
provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital 
table of contents requirements of the corporation and the bank could require the corporation and the bank to seek other sources of capital in the future 
the dodd frank act also expands the base for fdic insurance assessments 
assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
the dodd frank act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  retroactive to january  and increases the minimum reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund from to 
the dodd frank act repeals the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
the dodd frank act also provides for amendments to the electronic fund transfer act efta which have resulted in rules limiting debit card interchange fees and stringent requirements regarding remittance transfers to locations outside the united states 
provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments  payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees could increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate 
changes regarding remittance transfers to locations outside the united states may increase the costs associated with these services and discourage the provision of these services 
other significant provisions of the dodd frank act include comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives activities in the institution itself  establishment of fiduciary duties for broker dealers when providing investment advice to retail customers  which standard would be no less stringent than the standard currently applied to investment advisors  prohibitions on banking entities from engaging in most proprietary trading or from acquiring or retaining any equity  partnership or other ownership interest in  or sponsorship of  a private equity or hedge fund  subject to certain limited exceptions  mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer ability to repay  restricting variable rate lending by requiring that the ability to repay be determined for variable rate loans by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable rate loan term  and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans  new disclosures  and certain other revisions  and corporate governance requirements regarding executive compensation and related disclosure that apply to all public companies  not just financial institutions 
the increased regulatory burden on the financial services industry  including legislative and regulatory changes affecting capital  liquidity  supervision  permissible activities  corporate governance and compensation  changes in fiscal policy and steps to eliminate government support for banking organizations  may have long term effects on the business model and profitability of banking organizations that cannot now be foreseen 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company  its customers or the financial services industry more generally 
anti money laundering and ofac regulation a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing 
the bank secrecy act of bsa and subsequent laws and regulations require the bank to take steps to prevent the use of the bank or its systems from facilitating the flow of illegal or illicit money and to file suspicious activity reports 
those 
table of contents requirements include ensuring effective board and management oversight  establishing policies and procedures  developing effective monitoring and reporting capabilities  ensuring adequate training and establishing a comprehensive internal audit of bsa compliance activities 
the usa patriot act of patriot act significantly expanded the anti money laundering aml and financial transparency laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
regulations promulgated under the patriot act impose various requirements on financial institutions  such as standards for verifying client identification at account opening and maintaining expanded records including know your customer and enhanced due diligence practices and other obligations to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to aid the process of preventing  detecting  and reporting money laundering and terrorist financing 
the patriot act also applies bsa procedures to broker dealers 
an institution subject to the patriot act must provide aml training to employees  designate an aml compliance officer and annually audit the aml program to assess its effectiveness 
the occ continues to issue regulations and new guidance with respect to the application and requirements of bsa and aml 
the united states has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries  nationals and others 
based on their administration by treasury office of foreign assets control ofac  these are typically known as the ofac rules 
the ofac administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms 
generally  however  they contain one or more of the following elements i restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country  including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in  or providing investment related advice or assistance to  a sanctioned country  and ii a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest  by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons 
blocked assets eg  property and bank deposits cannot be paid out  withdrawn  set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac 
failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate bsa  aml and ofac programs  or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations  could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
fair lending laws the enforcement of fair lending laws has been an increasing area of focus for regulators  including the occ and cfpb 
fair lending laws related to extensions of credit are included in the equal credit opportunity act of and the fair housing act of which prohibit discrimination in residential real estate and credit transactions based on race  color  national origin  sex  marital status  familial status  religion  age  physical ability  the fact that all or part of the applicant income derives from a public assistance program or the fact that the applicant has exercised any right under the consumer credit protection act 
under the fair lending laws  lenders can also be liable for policies which have a disparate impact on  or result in disparate treatment of  a protected class of applicants or borrowers 
lenders are required to have a fair lending program that is of sufficient scope to monitor the inherent fair lending risk of the institution and that appropriately remediates any issues which are identified 
generally  regulatory agencies are required to refer fair lending violations to the department of justice for investigation 
in december  the department of justice and cfpb entered into a memorandum of understanding under which the agencies have agreed to share information  coordinate investigations and have generally committed to strengthen their coordination efforts 
failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement an adequate fair lending program  or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations  could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 

table of contents dividends and other transfers of funds the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
dividends from the bank constitute the principal source of cash revenues to the corporation 
the bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the corporation 
the prior approval of the occ is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the sum of the bank net profits for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years  less any required transfers to surplus 
federal law also prohibits national banks from paying dividends that would be greater than the bank undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the bank allowance for loan and lease losses 
in addition  federal bank regulatory authorities can prohibit the bank from paying dividends  depending upon the bank financial condition and compliance with capital and non capital safety and soundness standards established under the federal deposit insurance act  as described below 
federal regulatory authorities have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
federal law limits the ability of the bank to extend credit to the corporation or its other affiliates  to invest in stock or other securities thereof  to take such securities as collateral for loans  and to purchase assets from the corporation or other affiliates 
these restrictions prevent the corporation and such other affiliates from borrowing from the bank unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts 
further  such secured loans and investments by the bank to or in the corporation or to or in any other affiliate are limited individually to percent of the bank capital stock and surplus and in the aggregate to percent of the bank capital stock and surplus 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
federal law also provides that extensions of credit and other transactions between the bank and the corporation or one of its non bank subsidiaries must be on terms and conditions  including credit standards  that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the bank as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving other non affiliated companies  or  in the absence of comparable transactions  on terms and conditions  including credit standards  that in good faith would be offered to  or would apply to  non affiliated companies 
further  a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  lease or sale of property  or furnishing of services 
capital adequacy and prompt corrective action each federal banking regulatory agency has adopted risk based capital regulations under which a banking organization capital is compared to the risk associated with its operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets as well as transactions that are off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements 
under the capital regulations  the nominal dollar amounts of assets and the balance sheet equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from zero percent for asset categories with low credit risk  such as cash and certain treasury securities  to percent for asset categories with relatively high credit risk  such as commercial loans 
in total  these balances comprise the company risk weighted assets rwa which are the basis for important regulatory capital ratios 
bank holding companies and national banks such as the corporation and the bank are currently required to maintain tier and total capital equal to at least percent and percent  respectively  of their total rwa before they may be classified as adequately capitalized 
banking organizations with tier and total capital ratios above percent and percent  respectively  are eligible to be classified as well capitalized by the regulatory agencies 
the risk based capital rules reflect the credit risk of the company activities  not other risks such as interest rate  liquidity  business or operational risks 

table of contents during volatile or turbulent market conditions  bank regulators may set higher capital requirements for individual banks or for categories of banks 
in order to maintain a capital reserve sufficient to support normal banking operations during such turbulent episodes  the company uses internal capital adequacy assessment and stress testing procedures to establish board approved guidelines for capital management 
in addition to the risk based capital guidelines  federal banking regulatory agencies require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for banks with low risk balance sheets  strong liquidity  earnings and capital  and the lowest level of supervisory concern  the minimum leverage ratio is percent 
for all other banks  the minimum leverage ratio is percent 
these minimum standards are necessary for a bank to be classified as adequately capitalized 
banks with leverage capital ratios of percent or more may be classified as well capitalized 
as with the risk based capital requirements  banks with supervisory  financial  operational  or managerial weaknesses  as well as organizations that are anticipating or experiencing significant growth  are expected to maintain capital ratios above the minimum levels 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the federal banking agencies have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
at december   the corporation and the bank each exceeded the required risk based capital ratios for classification as well capitalized as well as the required minimum leverage ratios for the bank 
see management discussion and analysis balance sheet analysis capital of this report 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take prompt corrective action with respect to fdic insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
a depository institution treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend on how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors  as established by regulation 
fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations  management and capital distributions depending on the category in which an institution is classified 
failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements 
an undercapitalized bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank compliance with the plan 
the liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of five percent of the bank assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with the plan 
furthermore  in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company  such guarantee would take priority over the parent general unsecured creditors 
in addition  fdicia requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non capital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management  asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards 
the current us federal bank regulatory agencies risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord basel i of the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs 
the bcbs is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply 
for several years  the us bank regulators have been preparing to implement a new framework for risk based capital adequacy developed by bcbs  sometimes referred to as basel ii 
in july  the us bank regulators announced an agreement reflecting their then current plan for implementing the most advanced approach under basel ii for the largest  most internationally active financial institutions 
the agreement also provides that the regulators will propose rules permitting other 
table of contents financial institutions  such as the corporation  to choose between the current method of calculating risked based capital basel i and the standardized approach under basel ii 
the standardized approach under basel ii would lower risk weightings for certain categories of assets including mortgages from the weightings reflected in basel i  but would also require an explicit capital charge for operational risk  which is not required by basel i 
in july  the us bank regulators proposed a new rule  which includes the previously mentioned methods to calculate risked based capital  but for institutions using the standardized framework  modifies the method for determining the leverage ratio requirement 
at this time  basel ii does not apply to either the corporation or the bank 
in december  the bcbs published the final version of the capital accord commonly referred to as basel iii 
a key goal of the basel iii agreement is to strengthen the capital resources of banking organizations during normal and challenging business environments 
the standards established in the capital accord will be implemented by the governing regulatory agencies of the participating nations 
these standards must also be integrated with the safety and soundness standards required under the dodd frank act 
in june  united states banking regulators issued proposed standards combining basel iii and dodd frank act requirements 
the proposed requirements will be phased in over several years  and will replace the previous regulatory model established under the basel i accord 
important elements of the basel iii standards include the following increase minimum capital requirements  raise the quality of capital so banks are better able to absorb losses  implement a leverage ratio concept for international banks and us bank holding companies  establish a specific capital conservation buffer  and provide a more uniform supervisory standard for u 
s financial institution regulatory agencies 
basel iii represents both an addition to  and a revision of  the approach of basel ii 
as basel iii has not yet been finalized and implemented by the federal banking agencies  the corporation cannot be certain as to how basel iii will impact the corporation or the bank  or how the requirements of the dodd frank act will be reconciled with those of basel iii 
premiums for deposit insurance the bank deposits are insured to applicable limits by the fdic  which insurance is funded through assessments on member banks such as the bank 
the emergency economic stabilization act of temporarily raised the maximum standard deposit insurance amount to  in october  the fdic established a temporary liquidity guarantee program under which the fdic fully insured all funds in non interest bearing transaction accounts until december   which was later extended to the transaction account guarantee program and guaranteed certain senior unsecured debt of insured depository institutions or their qualified holding companies issued between october  and october  with the fdic guarantee expiring december  the debt guarantee program 
the bank did not participate in the debt guarantee program 
the bank did participate in the transaction account guarantee program until july  thereafter  the dodd frank act deposit insurance provision permanently increased the maximum deposit insurance amount from  to  effective december  and provided unlimited fdic deposit insurance on non interest bearing transactions accounts for all fdic insured banks effective from december   through december  the provision authorizing unlimited deposit insurance terminated on december   and was not extended 
the expiration of the program did not have a significant impact to the company deposit levels and the company maintains significant readily available liquidity resources to fund any further outflows 
while the company has experienced deposit outflows since december   this is primarily attributed to seasonal cash flow variability of the bank clients 

table of contents in june  the fdic imposed a special assessment equal to five basis points of assets less tier capital as of june  payable on september  and reserved the right to impose additional special assessments 
in lieu of further special assessments  on november  the fdic approved a final rule to require all insured depository institutions to prepay their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of   and on december  the prepaid assessment would be applied against the actual assessment until exhausted 
any funds remaining after june  would be returned to the institution 
if the prepayment would impair an institution liquidity or otherwise create significant hardship  it could apply for an exemption 
the dodd frank act expanded the base for fdic insurance assessments  requiring that assessments be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
in  the fdic approved a final rule to implement the foregoing provision of the dodd frank act and to make other changes to the deposit insurance assessment system applicable to insured depository institutions with over billion in assets  such as the bank 
among other things  the final rule eliminates risk categories and the use of long term debt issuer ratings in calculating risk based assessments  and instead implements a scorecard method  combining camels ratings and certain forward looking financial measures to assess the risk an institution poses to the deposit insurance fund 
the final rule also revises the base assessment rate schedule for large institutions and highly complex institutions to provide assessments ranging from to basis points 
in addition  all fdic insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the fdic to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation 
the fico assessment rates  which are determined quarterly  was for calendar year and have been set at for the first quarter of these assessments will continue until the fico bonds mature in depositor preference the federal deposit insurance act provides that  in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution  the claims of depositors of the institutions  including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors  and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver  will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution 
if an insured depository institution fails  insured and uninsured depositors  along with the fdic  will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured non deposit creditors  including the parent bank holding company  with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 
interstate banking and branching the riegle neal interstate banking and branching act permits banks and bank holding companies from any state to acquire banks located in any other state  subject to certain conditions  including certain nationwide and state imposed concentration limits 
the company also has the ability  subject to certain restrictions  to acquire branches outside its home state by acquisition or merger 
under the dodd frank act  the establishment of new interstate branches is currently permitted 
the corporation has established or acquired banking operations outside its home state of california in the states of new york  nevada  tennessee and georgia 
community reinvestment act under the community reinvestment act of  the bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound banking practices to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
cra does not establish specific 
table of contents lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with cra 
cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution  such as applications for charters  branches and other deposit facilities  relocations  mergers  consolidations and acquisitions or engage in certain activities pursuant to the glb act 
an unsatisfactory rating may be the basis for denying the application 
based on its most recent examination report from july  the bank received an overall rating of satisfactory 
in arriving at the overall rating  the occ rated the bank performance levels under cra with respect to lending high satisfactory  investment outstanding and service high satisfactory 
consumer protection laws the company is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population 
these laws include the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act  the truth in lending act  the home mortgage disclosure act  the real estate settlement procedures act  various state law counterparts  and the consumer financial protection act of  which constitutes part of the dodd frank act and establishes the cfpb  as described above 
in addition  federal law and certain state laws including california currently contain client privacy protection provisions 
these provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to affiliated companies and non affiliated third parties 
these rules require disclosure of privacy policies to clients and  in some circumstance  allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or non affiliated third parties by means of opt out or opt in authorizations 
pursuant to the glb act and certain state laws including california companies are required to notify clients of security breaches resulting in unauthorized access to their personal information 
securities and exchange commission pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of sox  publicly held companies such as the corporation have significant requirements  particularly in the area of external audits  financial reporting and disclosure  conflicts of interest  and corporate governance

item a risk factors forward looking statements this report and other reports and statements issued by the company and its officers from time to time contain forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
these statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management  and on information currently available to our management 
forward looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations  and statements preceded by  followed by  or that include the words will  believes  expects  anticipates  intends  plans  estimates  or similar expressions 
our management believes these forward looking statements are reasonable 
however  you should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements  since they are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially from those currently expected or anticipated 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance 
by their nature  forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
these statements speak only as of the date they are made 
the company does not undertake to update forward looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward looking statements are made or to update earnings guidance including the factors that influence earnings 
a number of factors  many of which are beyond the company ability to control or predict  could cause future results to differ 
table of contents materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
these factors include  without limitation  the significant factors set forth below 
factors that may affect future results general business and economic conditions may significantly affect our earnings 
our business and earnings are sensitive to general economic  political and industry conditions 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  economic growth  efficient capital markets  low inflation  high business and investor confidence and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  rising inflation or interest rates  political unrest  acts of war  terrorism  natural disasters  or a combination of these or other factors 
a political  economic or financial disruption in the united states or other countries or regions could adversely impact our business by increasing volatility in financial markets generally 
the united states in recent years has faced a severe economic crisis including a major recession from which it is slowly recovering 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions remains reduced and local governments and many businesses continue to experience financial difficulty 
while reflecting some improvement  unemployment levels remain elevated 
there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue to improve and these conditions could worsen 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in further changes in consumer spending  borrowing and savings habits which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  unresolved federal budget negotiations and the level of united states debt may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets 
europe and other global economies face continued economic stresses  including increasing debt levels  that could impact the capital markets generally  including the trading price of securities  such as our common stock  that do not have substantial direct exposure to foreign economies 
our financial performance is impacted by the business conditions in the markets where we operate and in the united states generally 
the demand for credit and other banking products and the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal on outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans is driven by economic conditions in the markets where our customers operate 
our business can be negatively affected by changes in the financial performance and or condition of our borrowers  including through decreased loan utilization rates  increased delinquencies and defaults and changes to our customers ability to meet certain credit obligations 
declines in real estate values in the markets in which we operate  including california  nevada and new york  have impacted our results of operations 
while there have been some signs of improvement  further declines in real estate values in the markets where we operate could lead to delinquencies and credit quality issues in our residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios which could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
in addition  negative economic conditions coupled with elevated unemployment and reduced consumer spending could result in higher credit losses in our commercial loan  commercial real estate loan and commercial real estate construction loan portfolios 
the dodd frank act and related legislation regarding the financial services industry may have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
the dodd frank act  which was signed into law on july   has had  and will continue to have  a broad impact on the financial services industry  imposing significant regulatory and compliance changes  increased capital  leverage and liquidity requirements and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of the financial services sector 
the dodd frank act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations  and to prepare numerous studies and reports for congress 
the federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the rules and regulations  and  as a result  many of 
table of contents the details and much of the impact of the dodd frank act may not be known for many months or years 
many of the provisions of the dodd frank act  and related legislation and rulemaking  directly affect our business  including  but not limited to  the following establishment of the financial stability oversight council fsoc which is charged with identifying risks to financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure  or ongoing activities  of nonbank financial companies 
the fsoc may recommend to the federal reserve increasingly strict rules for capital  leverage  liquidity  risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity  provisions requiring that all insured depository institutions and their holding companies be subject to the same generally applicable risk based capital and leverage rules which led to the removal of trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a holding company tier capital and other comprehensive revisions to regulatory capital rules  including the basel iii capital standards discussed further below  changes to the fdic assessment for depository institutions with assets of billion or more  such as the bank  and increases to the minimum reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund from to  repeal of the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts  establishment of the cfpb with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations and  for banking organizations with billion or more in assets  to examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer laws  amendments to the efta which have resulted in rules limiting debit card interchange fees and stringent requirements regarding remittance transfers to locations outside the united states  and establishment of mortgage reform provisions regarding a customer ability to repay  restricting variable rate lending by requiring that the ability to repay be determined for variable rate loans by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable rate loan term  and making more loans subject to provisions for higher cost loans  new disclosures  and certain other revisions 
most provisions in the dodd frank act remain subject to regulatory rule making and implementation  the effects of which are not yet known  including mandates requiring the federal reserve to establish compensation guidelines covering regulated financial institutions 
the provisions of the dodd frank act and any rules adopted to implement those provisions as well as any additional legislative or regulatory changes may impact the profitability of our business activities  may require that we change certain of our business practices  may materially affect our business model or affect retention of key personnel  may require us to raise additional regulatory capital and could expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs 
these and other changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our results of operations or financial condition 
further significant changes in banking laws or regulations  the interpretation of those rules and regulations  and changes in federal monetary policy could materially affect our business 
in addition to the dodd frank act discussed above  the banking industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the implementation of new laws or changes in existing laws  including changes in the interpretations of such laws and related rules and regulations by regulators  courts or others  could have a negative impact on our business 
federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes 
table of contents to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied 
parts of our business are also subject to federal and state securities laws and regulations 
significant changes in these laws and regulations could also affect our business 
for further discussion of the regulation of financial services  see supervision and regulation and the discussion under item  business  economic conditions  government policies  legislation and regulation 
we cannot predict the substance or impact of any change in regulation  whether by regulators or as a result of legislation  or in the way such statutory or regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced 
compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs  impede the efficiency of our internal business practices  require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner 
our business is also impacted by federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system 
federal monetary policy significantly affects our credit conditions  primarily through open market operations in us government securities  the discount rate for member bank borrowing  and bank reserve requirements 
changes in trade and monetary and fiscal policies and laws  including the interest rate policies of the board of governors of the federal reserve system could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
we may be subject to more stringent capital requirements 
as discussed above  the dodd frank act creates a financial stability oversight council that will recommend to the federal reserve increasingly strict rules for capital requirements as companies grow in size and complexity  requires that the occ seek to make countercyclical its capital requirements for national banks and applies the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies 
these requirements  and any other new regulations  could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends  or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital  including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we are also subject to risk based capital guidelines implemented by the us federal bank regulatory agencies based on the capital accord of the bcbs  referred to as basel i 
for several years  the us bank regulators have been preparing to implement a new framework for risk based capital adequacy developed by bcbs  referred to as basel ii 
in december  the bcbs published the final version of the capital accord commonly referred to as basel iii 
a key goal of the basel iii agreement is to strengthen the capital resources of banking organizations during normal and challenging business environments 
the standards established in the capital accord will be implemented by the governing regulatory agencies of the participating nations 
these standards must also be integrated with the safety and soundness standards required under the dodd frank act 
in june  united states banking regulators issued proposed standards combining basel iii and dodd frank act requirements 
the proposed requirements will be phased in over several years  and will replace the previous regulatory model established under the basel i accord 
important elements of the basel iii standards include the following increase minimum capital requirements  raise the quality of capital so banks are better able to absorb losses  implement a leverage ratio concept for international banks and us bank holding companies  establish a specific capital conservation buffer  and provide a more uniform supervisory standard for u 
s financial institution regulatory agencies 
basel iii represents both an addition to  and a revision of  the approach of basel ii 
as basel iii has not yet been finalized and implemented by the federal banking agencies  the corporation cannot be certain as to how basel iii will impact the corporation or the bank  or how the requirements of the dodd frank act will be reconciled with those of basel iii 
stricter capital requirements and capital 
table of contents ratios could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends  or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital  including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
see the section captioned capital adequacy and prompt corrective action in item business located elsewhere in this report for further discussion 
changes in interest rates affect our profitability 
we derive our income mainly from the difference or spread between the interest we earn on loans  securities  and other interest earning assets  and interest we pay on deposits  borrowings  and other interest bearing liabilities 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  such as inflation  recession  and unemployment 
in general  the greater this spread  the more we earn 
when market rates of interest change  the interest we earn on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities fluctuate 
this causes our spread to increase or decrease and affects our net interest income 
although we actively manage our asset and liability positions  we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  meaning that either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
in either event  if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap would work against us  and our earnings may be negatively affected 
in addition  interest rates affect how much money we lend  and changes in interest rates may negatively affect deposit growth 
changes in inflation  interest rates and market liquidity may also impact our margins and funding sources 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were to suffer higher than expected losses on our loans due to a slow economy  real estate cycles or other economic events which could require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses 
we assume credit risk from the possibility that we will suffer losses because borrowers  guarantors  and related parties fail to perform under the terms of their loans 
we try to minimize and monitor this risk by adopting and implementing what we believe are effective underwriting and credit policies and procedures  including how we establish and review the allowance for loan and lease losses 
we assess the likelihood of nonperformance  track loan performance  and diversify our credit portfolio 
those policies and procedures may not prevent unexpected losses that could adversely affect our results 
the company continually monitors changes in the economy  particularly housing prices and unemployment rates 
there are inherent risks in our lending activities  including flat or volatile interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate 
continuing weak economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of collateral securing those loans 
if the value of real estate in the company market declines materially  a significant portion of the loan portfolio could become under collateralized which could have a negative effect on results of operations 
we monitor the value of collateral  such as real estate  for loans made by us 
deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of the company control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
see the section captioned loan and lease portfolio and asset quality in item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our loan portfolio and our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses 
we may experience further impairments of loans covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic that could negatively impact our earnings 
covered loans consist of acquired loans that are covered under loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
the company updates its cash flow projections for covered loans on a quarterly basis 
if the expected cash flows decrease due to an anticipated deterioration of performance of covered loans and or the timing of cash flows and credit losses  a provision expense and an allowance for loan losses could be recognized 
to the extent that incorrect assumptions in the value of the covered loans result in greater than anticipated losses in the covered 
table of contents loan portfolio exceeding the losses covered by the loss sharing agreements with the fdic  it could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
disruptions to our information systems and security breaches could adversely affect our business and reputation 
in the ordinary course of business  we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our businesses and to store sensitive data  including financial information regarding our customers 
the integrity of information systems are under significant threat from cyber attacks by third parties  including through coordinated attacks sponsored by foreign nations to disrupt business operations and other compromises to data and systems for political or criminal purposes 
we employ an in depth defense approach that leverages people  processes and technology to manage and maintain cyber security controls 
we have an experienced team of information security professionals  the latest automated tools  and board approved policies  to secure our digital environment 
we employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor  block  and alert on any suspicious activity  as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats 
we have not experienced any significant compromises due to cyber security attacks 
to date there have been no security breaches of our systems  no virus outbreaks  no compromise of data  and no material financial losses related to cyber attacks 
although rogue viruses on occasion do penetrate the external automated tools  they have been caught timely by internal filters 
the historical impact of such attacks on our operations  expenses and risks has been very low  with no incidents experienced in recent years that pose any significant risks to the integrity of confidential company or client information 
although to date we have not experienced material financial losses related to these risks  there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future 
any such losses can adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations  and could expose us to reputation risk  the loss of client business  as well as additional regulatory scrutiny  possible litigation  and related financial liability 
these risks also include possible business interruption 
cyber security risks may also occur with our third party technology service providers  and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us  with attendant potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
risks and exposures related to cyber security attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats  as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking  mobile banking and other technology based products and services by us and our clients 
a portion of the income generated by our wealth management division and asset management affiliates is subject to market valuation risks 
a substantial portion of trust and investment fee income is based on equity  fixed income and other market valuations 
as a result  volatility in these markets can positively or negatively impact noninterest income 
in addition  because of the low interest rate environment  the off balance sheet money market funds managed by our wealth management business may be at a greater risk of being moved by our clients to another company or to the bank on balance sheet money market funds 
as a result  this may have an unfavorable impact on our earnings 
we may experience write downs of our financial instruments and other losses related to volatile and illiquid market conditions 
market volatility  illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets have made it difficult to value certain of our securities 
subsequent valuations  in light of factors then prevailing  may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods 
in addition  at the time of any sales and settlements of these securities  the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value 
any of these factors could require us to take write downs in the value of our securities portfolio  which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in future periods 

table of contents bank clients could move their money to alternative investments causing us to lose a lower cost source of funding 
demand deposits can decrease when clients perceive alternative investments  such as those available in our wealth management business  as providing a better risk return tradeoff 
technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds into alternative investments or other deposit accounts offered by other financial institutions or non bank service providers 
when clients move money out of bank demand deposits and into other investments  we lose a relatively low cost source of funds  increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income 
increased competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking and wealth management services could negatively impact our business 
increased competition in our markets may result in lower loan levels  a reduction in deposits and or assets under management  increased costs and may limit our ability to increase market share 
many competitors offer the banking services and wealth management services that we offer in our service area 
these competitors  both domestic and foreign  include national  regional  and community banks 
a substantial and permanent loss of either client accounts or assets under management at our wealth management affiliates or our wealth management division could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we also face intense competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  credit unions  private equity funds  mortgage banks  and other financial intermediaries 
banks  trust companies  investment advisors  mutual fund companies  multi family offices and insurance companies compete with us for trust and asset management business 
in addition  technological advances and the growth of e commerce have made it possible for non depository institutions to offer products and services that were traditionally offered only by banks 
we also face intense competition for talent 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to hire and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most businesses in which we engage can be intense 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate talented people  our business could suffer 
the dodd frank act includes mandates requiring the federal reserve to establish compensation guidelines covering regulated financial institutions 
restrictions on executive compensation could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain our talent 
our controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  but not absolute  assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls  and that the objectives of these controls have been met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures  and any failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in accounting standards or tax legislation could have a negative impact on our business 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time the financial accounting standards board and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements or elected representatives approve changes to tax laws that could affect our corporate taxes 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
businesses we acquire may not perform as expected which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
we have in the past and may in the future seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses 
we cannot predict the frequency  size or timing of our acquisitions  and we typically do not comment publicly on a possible acquisition until we have signed a definitive agreement 
there can be no assurance that our acquisitions will have the anticipated positive 
table of contents results  including results related to the total cost of integration  the time required to complete the integration  the amount of longer term cost savings  continued growth  or the overall performance of the acquired company or combined entity 
integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly 
if the businesses we acquire do not perform as expected or we are not able to integrate successfully past or future acquisitions  there is a risk that results of operations could be adversely affected 
we also expand our operations through de novo branching efforts 
if our de novo branching efforts are not successful in driving new business  it could increase our operation costs and have a negative impact on our business 
impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets associated with acquisitions would result in a charge to earnings 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually  and amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
we may be required to record a charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or intangibles is determined 
our business and financial results could be impacted materially by adverse results in legal proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries 
aspects of our business involve risk of legal liability 
we have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various legal proceedings arising from our business activities 
in addition  we may be the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry from time to time 
the results of these legal proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties  restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business  or reputational harm 
although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss 
in addition  amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question 
thus  our ultimate losses may be higher or lower  and possibly significantly so  than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies 
our business and financial performance could be adversely affected  directly or indirectly  by disasters  by terrorist activities or by international hostilities 
neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters  terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted 
however  these occurrences could impact us directly as a result of damage to our facilities or by preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course  or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers  the value of collateral  depositors  other customers  suppliers or other counterparties 
we could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters  terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region 
for example  a significant earthquake could impact us directly by disrupting our business operations or could lead to an increase in delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets  net charge offs and provisions for credit losses 
our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning  and our ability  if any  to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs 
the adverse impact of disasters or terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with  particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over 
negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings 
reputational risk  or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative public opinion  is inherent in our business 
negative public opinion can result from the actual or perceived manner in which we conduct our business activities  including activities in our private and business banking operations and investment and trust operations  our management of actual or potential conflicts of interest and ethical 
table of contents issues  and our protection of confidential client information 
negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action 
we take steps to minimize reputation risk in the way we conduct our business activities and deal with our clients  communities and vendors 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations
