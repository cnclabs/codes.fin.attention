the alliance will operate under the name sourcepoint industrial 
we sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our distribution segment canadian operations on december   and recorded a gain on the sale  net of tax  of million 
on december   we announced the distribution segment national distributor agreement with schneider electric schneider  a global specialist in energy management 
the distribution segment is now a distributor for schneider s line of industrial automation and control products as well as select power control and protection products commonly used in motor control applications 
during the fourth quarter  we recorded a net loss of million associated with the resolution of an aerospace segment program related matter 
in the fourth quarter of  we were awarded a million commercial sales contract for our joint programmable fuze jpf from a foreign military 
we delivered  fuzes under our jpf program with the us government during the fourth quarter of  for a total of  for the year ended december  on november  we replaced our million revolving credit facility with a million revolving credit facility expiring on july  in addition  we replaced our million four year term loan with a million term loan commitment expiring on july during the third quarter  a definitive agreement was signed by kaman aerospace group and kineco private limited to form a manufacturing joint venture in goa  india  kineco kaman composites india  which closed on november  we began limited operations during the fourth quarter 
the newly formed company manufactures advanced composite structures for aerospace  medical and other industries 
in july  the us marine corp approved the deployment extension of the unmanned k max 
this extension allows for k max service in afghanistan for an additional six months through march  and includes an option to extend its time through september through december   we have made cumulative payments of million aud to the commonwealth of australia in accordance with our settlement agreement related to the sh g a helicopters 
of this amount  million aud was paid in in july  we entered into a five year contract with aircelle to produce composite structures at our uk composites facility 
during the second quarter  we signed a long term agreement lta for the next multi year contract on the sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program  which will allow us to continue to perform work under this program through during the first quarter  we were awarded a million order from the united states air force usaf under option of our jpf program 
on february   our common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange 
outlook as we look at  we anticipate another year of progress toward our long term goals  with growth in both our operating segments 
we recognize that will present challenges for our business and anticipate that both reduced department of defense spending and declining industrial production will pose modest near term headwinds 
we are closely monitoring the impact these matters could have on our results and believe we are prepared to manage through these issues 
our outlook is as follows distribution sales of  million to  million  up to over sales from continuing operations operating margins of to aerospace sales of million to million  up to over operating margins of to interest expense of approximately million corporate expenses of approximately million estimated annualized tax rate of approximately capital expenditures of million to million free cash flow of million to million results of continuing operations consolidated results net sales from continuing operations in thousands distribution aerospace total change change the increase in net sales from continuing operations for as compared to was attributable to an increase in organic sales at our aerospace segment and the contribution of million in sales from the acquisitions completed in and  partially offset by lower organic sales at our distribution segment 
foreign currency exchange rates had a million unfavorable impact on sales from continuing operations during the increase in net sales from continuing operations for as compared to was attributable to an increase in organic sales at both our segments and the contribution of million in sales from the acquisitions completed in and foreign currency exchange rates had a million favorable impact on sales during see segment results of operations and financial condition below for further discussion of segment net sales 
gross profit from continuing operations in thousands gross profit change change of net sales gross profit from continuing operations increased in primarily due to the contribution of gross profit from our and acquisitions 
the distribution segment organic gross profit slightly improved  despite the lower base sales 
this was primarily due to increases in primary metal and fabricated metal manufacturing  nonmetallic mineral manufacturing and merchant wholesalers and durable goods  offset by declines in the food and beverage manufacturing industries  and the mining industry 
the aerospace segment had a slight decrease in gross profit due to the absence of commercial sales to foreign militaries of the jpf  lower shipments under our sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program due to lower customer requirements  a lower volume of work on our unmanned k max aircraft system and million in net loss resulting from the resolution of an aerospace segment program related matter and lower sales volume for our legacy fuze programs 
these decreases were mostly offset by higher sales volume related to our bearing product lines in the commercial and regional business jet markets and increased sales volume of the jpf to the usg 
gross profit from continuing operations increased in primarily due to organic increases in gross profit at both our segments and the contribution of gross profit from our and acquisitions 
the organic increase in gross profit in our distribution segment was primarily a result of higher sales volume compared to the prior year and higher gross margin rates despite increased competitive price pressures 
the organic increase in gross profit in our aerospace segment was due to increased sales volume related to our bearing product lines for the commercial and regional business jet markets  commercial sales to foreign militaries of the jpf  the contribution of gross profit from the k max unmanned aircraft systems and the absence of program related losses recorded in these increases were partially offset by decreased gross profit resulting from fewer shipments under our jpf program to the usg  lower volume in our helicopter aftermarket programs and a reduction in c program volume 
selling  general administrative expenses s  g a from continuing operations in thousands s  g a change change of net sales s  g a expenses from continuing operations increased for as compared to due to million of expenses related to our and acquisitions  an increase in organic expense at our distribution segment and higher corporate expenses 
the increase in expense at our distribution segment was attributable to an increase in employee related costs including group health insurance  and an increase in expense associated with the implementation of the new erp system 
corporate expense increased million for as compared to  with increases in our incentive compensation expense due to an increase in the number of participants  higher acquisition related costs  and the absence of the nonrecurring benefit of million associated with the death of a former executive received in partially offsetting these increases is an organic decrease in expense at our aerospace segment 
the lower expense at our aerospace segment was primarily due to the absence of a million expense associated with the settlement of the fmu matter in s  g a increased for as compared to due to increased expenses in both of our segments  including million of expenses related to our and acquisitions 
the higher expense at our distribution segment was attributable to acquisitions and an increase in variable costs such as sales commissions and other employee related costs resulting from the higher sales volume 
the increase in expense at our aerospace segment was primarily due to the additional expenses resulting from the acquisition of global aerosystems  our acquisition of vermont composites  million in expense associated with the settlement of the fmu matter and higher employee related costs 
corporate expense was relatively flat for as compared to  with increases in our incentive compensation expense and group health insurance expense virtually offset by lower acquisition related costs  lower pension expense and a nonrecurring benefit of million associated with the death of a former executive 
goodwill impairment in thousands goodwill impairment during the first quarter of  we were informally notified by a customer of its intent to terminate a contract that had been obtained in our acquisition of uk composites 
no sales were recognized related to the contract in question during the year ended december  throughout  management worked with this customer to find an acceptable resolution and maintain the work there under 
during the fourth quarter of we received a contract termination notice and  as a result  removed all future revenue and related profit associated with this contract from the reporting unit s projections when performing our annual test for impairment 
this contract loss  in addition to a reduction in revenue for other programs  reduced the revenue and earnings growth forecast to levels below those anticipated at the reporting unit s acquisition in  creating a situation in which step of the impairment analysis resulted in a fair value for the reporting unit below its carrying value 
upon completion of the step impairment analysis  we recorded a non cash non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of million representing of the total goodwill balance for the reporting unit to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
this charge was included in the operating results of our aerospace segment 
operating income from continuing operations in thousands operating income change change of net sales the increase in operating income from continuing operations for as compared to was driven by increases at both our segments 
the increase in operating income for as compared to was primarily driven by a significant increase at our distribution segment  offset slightly by a decrease at our aerospace segment 
see segment results of operations and financial condition below for further discussion of segment operating income 
interest expense  net in thousands interest expense  net net interest expense generally consists of interest charged on the revolving credit facility and other borrowings and the amortization of debt issuance costs  offset by interest income 
the increase in net interest expense for as compared to was primarily due to higher average borrowings under our revolving credit facility and a higher average interest rate for the period  partially offset by lower bank commitment fees and letter of credit fees 
at december   the interest rate for outstanding amounts on both the revolving credit facility and term loan agreement was compared to at december  the increases in net interest expense for as compared to were primarily due to the absence of the million of look back interest income received in  interest expense on our convertible notes and higher amortization of capitalized fees  partly offset by lower interest rates on our revolving credit facility and lower average bank borrowings during the year 
effective income tax rate for continuing operations effective income tax rate the effective tax rate for continuing operations represents the combined federal  state and foreign tax effects attributable to pretax earnings for the year 
the decrease in the effective rate for as compared to was due principally to the reversal of a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
the decrease in the effective rate for as compared to was due to the non cash non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of million recorded by the aerospace segment in and the receipt of non taxable life insurance proceeds in gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax the company sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our distribution segment canadian operations on december  the sale resulted in a net gain on disposal of discontinued operations of million

organic sales per sales day net sales acquisition sales organic sales sales days organic sales per sales day a change a organic sales per sales day is a metric management uses to evaluate performance trends in its distribution segment and is calculated by taking total organic sales divided by the number of sales days 
an acquisition is included in organic sales beginning with the thirteenth month following the date of acquisition 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non gaap financial measures 
net sales net sales for increased as compared to due to the contribution of million in sales for from our and acquisitions 
the distribution segment organic sales decreased slightly from as a result of current economic conditions  the industries in which this segment operates experienced slower growth during specifically  there were declines in the food and beverage manufacturing industries  mining industry and machinery manufacturing industry  mostly offset by increases in primary metal and fabricated metal manufacturing  nonmetallic mineral manufacturing and merchant wholesalers and durable goods 
net sales for increased as compared to due to a increase in organic sales  when measured on a same day sales basis  with our and acquisitions contributing million in sales for the growth in organic sales was due to increases in sales volume to both original equipment manufacturer oem and maintenance  repair and operations mro customers and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates for of million 
operating income operating income increased during as compared to primarily due to the increased sales volume as a result of our and acquisitions 
the increases were partially offset by an increase in employee related costs  including group health insurance  and an increase in expense associated with the implementation of our new erp system 
operating income increased during as compared to primarily due to the increased sales volume and the resulting impact on our ability to leverage operating costs  higher gross margin and the contribution of operating income from our acquisitions 
the increases were partially offset by an increase in variable costs such as sales commissions and other employee related costs resulting from the higher sales volume 
other matters parker we continue the process of implementing our national reseller agreement with parker hannifin corporation parker hydraulics  fluid connectors and automation products via their select tri motion distributors 
we have made progress toward the conversion of several brands of fluid power products to parker and will continue training initiatives in the coming quarters as we transition our customers requirements 
sales of parker branded products  when measured on a same store basis  were up in as compared to the prior year  however  this growth has been more than offset by declines in the other fluid power brands 
we believe our relationship with parker is an important long term marketing and strategic growth initiative for our distribution segment 
schneider during the fourth quarter  the distribution segment entered into a national distributor agreement with schneider electric  a global leader in electrical energy management 
we will now distribute schneider s line of industrial automation and control products commonly used in factory automation and motor control applications 
as part of the agreement  schneider will become the segment primary line of ac drives  sensors  low voltage controls and automation 
the deal also authorizes the sale of schneider electric programmable logic controllers plcs  human machine interfaces hmis and signaling equipment 
we expect to begin stocking these products at locations throughout the us in the first quarter of enterprise resource planning system in july  we announced our decision to invest in a new enterprise wide business system for our distribution segment 
the current anticipated total investment in the new system is approximately million  which will be spread over a number of years 
of the total investment  approximately will be capitalized 
depreciation and amortization of the capitalized cost is expected to begin in and increase over the following three to four years 
in order to minimize disruptions to our ongoing operations we have developed a project plan that takes a phased approach to implementation and includes appropriate contingencies 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of expense associated with the implementation of the new system 
aerospace segment our strategy our strategy for the aerospace segment is to expand our global market position in defense and commercial markets  while maintaining leadership in product technical performance and application engineering support  and continuing to concentrate on lean manufacturing techniques  lead time reduction and low cost sourcing 
results of operations the following table presents selected financial data for our aerospace segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales net sales net sales increased for as compared to due to increased shipments to the usg of the jpf  an increase in sales volume of our bearings products  the incremental contribution of sales from the acquisition of vermont composites in  increased deliveries under our boeing a program  an increase in sales volume on our commercial composite programs  higher volume of sales on our k max commercial spares and related parts programs  higher volume of sales on our bell blade program  increased shipments on the boeing due to customer requested rate increases  and the receipt of million related to the resolution of a program related matter during the fourth quarter 
these increases were partially offset by lower commercial sales of the jpf to foreign militaries  lower shipments under our sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program due to lower customer requirements  a lower volume of work on our unmanned k max aircraft system  a decrease in sales volume on our legacy fuze programs  a decrease in sales volume on our helicopter aftermarket programs  including the sh g e upgrade program  sh g spare parts to new zealand and our blade erosion coating program  lower volume on our helicopter offload programs  specifically the phase out of joining and installation work under the sikorsky offload program  a decrease in engineering design services for commercial platforms primarily driven by customer requirements  and an unfavorable impact of currency exchange rate changes of million 
net sales increased for as compared to due to an increase in sales volume on bearings products  the incremental contribution of sales from the acquisition of global aerosystems and vermont composites  work on the us naval air systems command contract for k max unmanned aircraft systems  an increase in commercial sales of the jpf fuze to foreign militaries  higher volume on the egypt sh g e upgrade program  an increase in sales volume on our legacy fuze programs  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates which favorably impacted sales by million 
these increases were partially offset by reduced shipments to the usg of the jpf fuze resulting from issues encountered during acceptance testing that interrupted production at various times throughout the year  reduced requirements under our sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program  reduced volume on our c program  and lower volume on our helicopter after market programs  including blade erosion coating programs 
operating income operating income increased for as compared to due to increased gross profit due to higher shipments of the jpf to the usg  increased gross profit due to higher sales volume on our bearings products primarily in the commercial  business regional jet  helicopter and military markets  decreased sg a costs  including the absence of costs associated with the settlement of the fmu matter in and related legal fees  higher gross profit on our k max commercial spares and related parts programs  and the incremental contribution of operating income from vermont composites 
these increases were partially offset by lower commercial sales of the jpf to foreign militaries  lower gross profit on our legacy fuze programs  lower shipments under our sikorsky black hawk programs due to reduced customer requirements  lower volume of work on our unmanned k max aircraft system  lower volume of work on our helicopter aftermarket programs  including the sh g e upgrade program and sales of sh g spare parts to new zealand  a net loss of million related to the resolution of a program related matter  and additional losses recorded on the sikorsky canadian mh helicopter program 
operating income increased for as compared to due to higher gross profit generated by our bearings products resulting from the increased sales volume noted above  contribution of gross profit from the k max unmanned aircraft systems  the absence of program related losses experienced in on the sikorsky canadian mh program and on one of our fuze programs  and operating income contributed by global aerosystems and to a lesser extent vermont composites 
these increases were partially offset by million in expense associated with the settlement of the fmu matter and decreased gross profit on our helicopter aftermarket programs due to decreased volume and a decrease in gross profit on our jpf program as a result of the suspension of deliveries due to production issues encountered in the second half of long term contracts for long term aerospace contracts  we generally recognize sales and income based on the percentage of completion method of accounting  which allows for recognition of revenue as work on a contract progresses 
we recognize sales and profit based on either the cost to cost method  in which sales and profit are recorded based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs to complete the contract  or the units of delivery method  in which sales are recognized as deliveries are made and cost of sales is computed on the basis of the estimated ratio of total cost to total sales 
revenue and cost estimates for all significant long term contracts for which revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting are reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
based upon these reviews  we record the effects of adjustments in profit estimates each period 
if at any time management determines that in the case of a particular contract total costs will exceed total contract revenue  we record a provision for the entire anticipated contract loss at that time 
the net decrease in our operating income from changes in contract estimates totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  these decreases were primarily driven by cost growth on aerostructure assemblies and additional cost for our jpf program 
backlog in thousands backlog the backlog balance remained consistent from to  however  the composition of backlog changed 
backlog related to our jpf program decreased by million  which was primarily offset by a million increase in our uh backlog and a million increase in backlog for our commercial composites programs 
the backlog balance decreased slightly from to vermont composites  acquired in the fourth quarter of  added million to our december  backlog 
this increase was offset by a million reduction in the uh backlog 
major programs product lines defense markets a the segment has contracted with boeing to produce the wing control surfaces inboard and outboard flaps  slats and deceleron assemblies for the us air force s a fleet 
this contract has a potential value of over million  however  annual quantities will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders boeing receives from the us air force 
initial deliveries under this program began in the third quarter of  however  our customer scheduling changed and the timing of deliveries shifted 
full rate production for this program began during the fourth quarter of approximately ship sets were delivered in bearings our bearings products are included on military platforms manufactured in north america and europe 
these products are used as original equipment and or specified as replacement parts by the manufacturers 
the most significant portion of our military sales is derived from us military platforms  such as the ah  c and f a aircraft  and sales in europe for the typhoon program 
these products are primarily proprietary self lubricating  ball and roller bearings for aircraft flight controls  turbine engines  and landing gear and driveline couplings for helicopters 
black hawk the sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program involves the manufacture of cockpits including the installation of all wiring harnesses  hydraulic assemblies  control pedals and sticks  seat tracks  pneumatic lines  and the composite structure that holds the windscreen for most models of the black hawk helicopter 
during the year ended december   we delivered cockpits compared to cockpits for the same period in the decline is due to a reduction in the requirements of our customer 
on may   we signed a long term agreement lta for the next multi year contract for this program  which will allow us to continue to perform work under this program through orders placed to date for the program will allow us to continue deliveries through included in backlog at december  is million for orders under this program 
the segment also performs additional subcontract work involving blade erosion coating on this aircraft 
during the fourth quarter  this program was put on stop work by the customer  due to a supplier related matter 
ah z the segment manufactures cabins for the increased capability ah z attack helicopter  which is produced by bell helicopter bell for the us marine corps 
the cabin is the largest and most complex airframe structure utilized in the final assembly of the ah z helicopter and has not been manufactured new since we currently have million in backlog for orders under this program  with potential follow on options the program value could exceed million 
this program has experienced delays due to the complexity of the assembly 
we have worked with our customer to resolve these issues and expect the first cabin delivery in the first half of c the segment continues production of structural wing subassemblies for the boeing c we have received orders under this program that will extend our work through the third quarter of during  we delivered ship sets 
we expect to ship ship sets in egypt sh g e the segment continues work under a program for depot level maintenance and upgrades for nine kaman sh g e helicopters originally delivered to the egyptian government during the s 
this program has a total contract value of approximately million 
as of december   million remains in backlog for this program 
fmu joint programmable fuze jpf we manufacture the jpf  an electro mechanical bomb safe and arming device  which allows the settings of a weapon to be programmed in flight 
during  we entered into a contract modification with the usaf for the award of options  and under our multi option jpf contract 
under option  we were awarded a total of million in jpf orders from the usaf for fuzes to be delivered in and additionally  during the fourth quarter of we were awarded a million commercial sales contract for jpf from a foreign military 
total jpf backlog at december   is million 
a total of  fuzes passed acceptance testing and were delivered to our customer during the fourth quarter  for a total of  fuzes delivered in the product line continues to perform above contract requirements for lot acceptance and operational reliability has been in excess of 
we occasionally experience lot acceptance test failures due to the complexity of the product and the extreme parameters of the acceptance test 
given the maturity of the product  we now generally experience isolated failures  rather than systematic ones 
as a result  identifying a root cause can take longer and result in less smooth delivery performance from quarter to quarter 
test failures did occur during and we worked closely with our customer to review our findings and ensure appropriate corrective actions were taken 
we continue to perform lot acceptance testing on fuze components and we expect to deliver approximately  to  fuzes in mh the sikorsky canadian mh helicopter program includes the manufacture and assembly of composite tail rotor pylons 
this program has undergone numerous customer directed design changes that caused costs on this program to exceed the originally proposed price for the contract 
during  we finalized contract price negotiations for this program increasing the contract value from million to approximately million 
although we received additional consideration for this contract we were not able to recover all the anticipated cost growth and because the price was less than anticipated we recorded a million contract loss during the third quarter of to date  we have recorded million in contract losses  million of which was recorded in as of december   we have nine units left to ship under this program 
commercial markets in late  we signed a seven year follow on contract with boeing for the production of fixed wing trailing edge assemblies for the boeing and aircraft 
during  on average we delivered ship sets per month on the boeing platform and ship sets per month on the boeing for  we currently estimate deliveries on the program to slightly increase while deliveries on the will decline to approximately ship sets per month 
this multi year contract has a potential value in excess of million  however  annual quantities will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders boeing receives from its customers 
airbus our uk composites operations provide composite components for many airbus platforms 
the most significant of these are the a  a  a and a orders for all of these platforms are dependent on the customer s build rate 
during we entered into a contract with aircelle to produce composite structures for the a platform at our uk composites facility 
additionally  we received an award letter in the fourth quarter for work on the aneo platform 
final contract negotiations are in process 
bearings our bearings products are included on commercial airliners and regional business jets manufactured in north and south america  europe and asia and are used as original equipment and or specified as replacement parts by airlines and aircraft manufacturers 
these products are primarily proprietary self lubricating  ball and roller bearings for aircraft flight controls  turbine engines  and landing gear  and driveline couplings for helicopters 
the most significant portion of our commercial sales is derived from boeing and airbus platforms  such as the boeing   and and the airbus a  a  a and a bell helicopter in september  we were awarded a five year contract with a potential value of million to build composite helicopter blade skins and skin core assemblies for bell helicopter 
under the terms of the contract  we are providing different assemblies for h       and ba aircraft 
all work is being performed at our full service aerospace innovation and manufacturing support center in bloomfield  connecticut 
first article deliveries to bell hurst  texas facility began in late  with full production starting in the first quarter of included in backlog at december  is million for orders under this program 
annual quantities for this program will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders bell receives from its customers 
other matters sh g i negotiations regarding a potential sale of sh g i super seasprite helicopters to the government of new zealand are in process 
no investment decisions have been made by new zealand at this time and we continue to market the eleven sh g i aircraft  spare parts and equipment to other potential customers 
sequestration the bca enacted year discretionary spending caps which are expected to generate over trillion in savings for the us government  a substantial portion of which comes from dod baseline spending reductions 
on january   the atra was signed into law  which among other things effectively delayed the implementation of the automatic sequestration process by approximately two months and reduced the spending cuts that were scheduled to occur during in proportion to the delay 
although we cannot predict where these cuts will be made  we believe our portfolio of programs and product offerings are well positioned and will not be materially impacted by such proposed dod budget cuts 
we conducted a program by program review of our aerospace segment to better assess the potential impact that sequestration may have on us  and our initial analysis  conducted during the fourth quarter of  indicates that approximately million to million of revenue is at risk for while significant  this is less than one and a half percent of our anticipated consolidated revenue  and any decline is expected to be more than offset by increased sales on our commercial programs due to production rate increases at boeing and airbus  as well as increased revenues on the ah z and a programs 
for a discussion of other matters related to our aerospace segment see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
liquidity and capital resources discussion and analysis of cash flows we assess liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund working capital and investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from or used by operating activities  capital expenditures  investments in our business segments and their programs  acquisitions  divestitures  dividends  availability of future credit  adequacy of available bank lines of credit  and factors that might otherwise affect the company business and operations generally  as described under the heading risk factors and forward looking statements in item a of part i of this form k 
we continue to rely upon bank financing as an important source of liquidity for our business activities including acquisitions 
we believe this  when combined with cash generated from operating activities  will be sufficient to support our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may decide to raise additional debt or equity capital to support other business activities including potential future acquisitions 
we anticipate our capital expenditures will be approximately to million in  primarily related to machinery and equipment and information technology infrastructure 
in addition to our working capital requirements  one or more of the following items could have an impact on our liquidity during the next months the matters described in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  including  the revenue sharing arrangement with the commonwealth of australia  and the cost of existing environmental remediation matters  required pension and supplemental employees retirement plan serp contributions  or the extension of payment terms by our customers 
however  we do not believe any of these matters will lead to a shortage of capital resources or liquidity that would prevent us from continuing with our business operations as expected 
we regularly monitor credit market conditions to identify potential issues that may adversely affect  or provide opportunities for  the securing and or pricing of additional financing  if any  that may be necessary to continue with our growth strategy and finance working capital requirements 
this is evidenced by our new credit agreement entered into during the fourth quarter of and our million issuance of convertible notes in november management regularly monitors its pension plan asset performance and the assumptions used in the determination of our benefit obligation  comparing them to actual performance 
we continue to believe the assumptions selected are valid due to the long term nature of our benefit obligation 
pursuant to the terms of the revenue sharing agreement with the commonwealth of australia  we will share all proceeds from the resale of the sh g i  formerly sh g a  aircraft  spare parts  and equipment with the commonwealth on a predetermined basis 
minimum payments of at least million aud must be made to the commonwealth regardless of sales 
cumulative payments of million aud have been made through december  an additional payment of million aud must be paid on march   to the extent that cumulative payments have not yet reached million aud as of that date 
to secure these payments  we have provided the commonwealth with an unconditional letter of credit  which is being reduced as such payments are made 
as of december   the us dollar value of the remaining million aud required payment was million

net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased million in compared to  primarily due to the following increased net earnings  driven by increased operating income at both our segments 
decreased contributions to the qualified pension plan  and decreases in our accounts receivable balances due to improved collections 
net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations increased million due to an increases in cash used for acquisitions and the purchase of property  plant and equipment  including the new erp system at our distribution segment 
these increases were partially offset by the receipt of million from the disposal of our distribution segment canadian operations 
net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations decreased million in compared to in  we had net repayments under the former revolving credit agreement of million  compared to net borrowings of million in additionally  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of long term debt in and had debt repayments million on the term loan agreement vs 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million in compared to  primarily due to increased net earnings  driven by increased operating income at both our segments and a reduction in the amount of our pension contribution  partially offset by the first guaranteed payment to the commonwealth of australia  which was reduced by the receipt of cash from our counterparties upon settlement of australian dollar foreign currency exchange contracts 
net cash used in investing activities increased million due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions and an increase in cash used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased million in compared to  primarily due to a reduction in borrowing and the use of cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program

the term loan commitment requires quarterly payments of principal which commence on march  at the rate of million with million payable in the final quarter of the facility term 
we may increase the aggregate amount of each of the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility by up to million in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement 
interest rates on amounts outstanding under the credit agreement are variable 
at december   the interest rate for the outstanding amounts on the credit agreement was 
at december   the interest rate for the outstanding amounts on our former revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement was 
in addition  we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused revolving loan commitment amount at a rate ranging from to per annum  based on the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio 
fees for outstanding letters of credit range from to  based on the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio 
the financial covenants associated with the credit agreement include a requirement that i the ratio of consolidated senior secured indebtedness to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  cannot be greater than to  ii the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  cannot be greater than to  and iii the ratio of consolidated ebitda to to the sum of a all interest  premium payments  debt discounts  fees  charges and related expenses and b the portion of rent expense under capital leases that is treated as interest expense  as defined in the credit agreement  cannot be less than to 
the company was in compliance with those financial covenants as of and for the quarter ended december   and management does not anticipate noncompliance in the foreseeable future 
total average bank borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan facility during the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december  as of december  and december   there was million and million available for borrowing  respectively  net of letters of credit 
letters of credit are generally considered borrowings for purposes of calculating available borrowings 
a total of million and million in letters of credit was outstanding as of december  and december   respectively 
at december  and december   million and million of our letters of credit  respectively  related to the guaranteed minimum payments to australia in connection with the ownership transfer of the sh g a helicopters along with spare parts and associated equipment 
the letter of credit balance will continue to be reduced as payments are made to australia 
the company will make the final guaranteed minimum payment to australia on march   if not before that date 
convertible notes in november  we issued convertible unsecured notes due on november  in the aggregate principal amount of million in a private placement offering 
these notes bear interest per annum on the principal amount  payable semiannually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning on may  proceeds from the offering were million  net of fees and expenses  which were capitalized 
the notes will mature on november   unless earlier redeemed  purchased by us or converted  and are convertible into cash and  at our election  shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  in certain circumstances 
the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest 
upon conversion  we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  at our election  with respect to any remaining amounts due 
prior to may   the notes are convertible only in the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after april  and only during any such fiscal quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock was greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price for at least trading days whether or not consecutive in the period of the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  or during the five consecutive business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which  for each day of that period  the trading price for the notes was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate on such trading day 
on and after may   until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date  holders may convert their notes at any time  regardless of the foregoing circumstances 
upon a change in control or termination of trading  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the offering  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of the initial purchasers of the notes 
these transactions are intended to reduce the potential dilution to our shareholders upon any future conversion of the notes 
the call options  which cost an aggregate million  were recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
we also entered into warrant transactions concurrently with the offering  pursuant to which we sold warrants to acquire up to approximately million shares of our common stock to the same counterparties that entered into the convertible note hedge transactions 
proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately million and were recorded as additional paid in capital 
the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions effectively increased the conversion price of the convertible notes 
during  we increased the dividend paid to our shareholders 
this resulted in an adjustment to the conversion rate for the convertible notes 
the following table illustrates the conversion rate at each date december  december  convertible notes conversion rate conversion price contingent conversion price aggregate shares to be issued upon conversion warrants warrant price the note payable principal balance at the date of issuance of million was bifurcated into the debt component of million and the equity component of million 
the difference between the note payable principal balance and the value of the debt component is being accreted to interest expense over a period of years 
the debt component was recognized at the present value of associated cash flows discounted using a discount rate  the borrowing rate at the date of issuance for a similar debt instrument without a conversion feature 
we recorded million of debt issuance costs as on offset to additional paid in capital 
the balance  million  is being amortized over the term of the notes 
debt issuance costs total expense associated with the amortization of debt issuance costs for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively 
total amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  including the million write off of capitalized fees related to the former revolving credit agreement 
interest rate swaps during the first quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging our eight quarterly variable rate interest payments on the term loan agreement due in and these interest rate swap agreements were designated as cash flow hedges 
they were intended to manage interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings and minimize the impact on our earnings and cash flows of interest rate fluctuations attributable to changes in libor rates 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of additional interest expense associated with the interest rate swap agreement 
as of december   these interest rate swap agreements had all matured 
other sources uses of capital pension we contributed million to the qualified pension plan and million to the serp during in  we contributed million to the qualified pension plan and million to the serp 
we plan to contribute million to the qualified pension plan and million to the serp in acquisitions the company invested the following in acquisitions for the year ended december  in thousands cash paid for acquisitions completed during the year cash paid for holdback payments during the year earnout and other payments during the year total investment we contractually committed to spend million for the two acquisitions completed in and million for acquisitions completed in both of the acquisitions are included in our distribution segment 
as of december   we have million remaining that represents holdback provisions related to acquisitions and million remaining that represents holdback provisions related to acquisitions  to be paid in future periods 
we anticipate that we will continue to identify and evaluate potential acquisition candidates  the purchase of which may require the use of additional capital 
stock repurchase plan in november  our board of directors approved a replenishment of our stock repurchase program  providing for repurchase of an aggregate of million common shares for use in administration of our stock plans and for general corporate purposes 
during  there were no shares repurchased under this program 
there were  shares repurchased at an average price of during under this program 
at december   approximately million shares remained authorized for repurchase under this program 
non gaap financial measures management believes that the non gaap generally accepted accounting principles measures used in this report on form k provide investors with important perspectives into our ongoing business performance 
we do not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 
other companies may define the measures differently 
we define the non gaap measures used in this report and other disclosures as follows organic sales per sales day organic sales per sales day is defined as gaap net sales from the distribution segment less sales derived from acquisitions completed during the preceding twelve months divided by the number of sales days in a given period 
sales days are the number of business days that the distribution segment s branch locations were open for business and exclude weekends and holidays 
management believes sales per sales day provides investors with an important perspective on how net sales may be impacted by the number of days the segment is open for business 
management uses organic sales per sales day as a measurement to compare periods in which the numbers of sales days differ 
free cash flow free cash flow is defined as gaap net cash provided by used in operating activities less expenditures for property  plant equipment  both of which are presented in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows 
management believes free cash flow provides an important perspective on the cash available for dividends to shareholders  debt repayment  and acquisitions after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation 
free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt 
management uses free cash flow internally to assess both business performance and overall liquidity 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain of the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total within year years years more than years long term debt convertible notes interest payments on debt a operating leases purchase obligations b other long term obligations c planned funding of pension and serp d payments to the commonwealth of australia e total note for more information refer to note  debt  note  commitments and contingencies  note  other long term liabilities  note  pension plans  and note  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
a interest payments on debt are calculated based on the applicable rate and payment dates for each instrument 
for variable rate instruments  interest rates and payment dates are based on management s estimate of the most likely scenarios for each relevant debt instrument 
b this category includes purchase commitments to suppliers for materials and supplies as part of the ordinary course of business  consulting arrangements and support services 
only obligations in the amount of at least  are included 
c this category includes obligations under the company long term incentive plan  deferred compensation plan  environmental liabilities  acquisition holdbacks and unrecognized tax benefits 
d this category includes planned funding of the company s serp and qualified defined benefit pension plan 
projected funding for the qualified defined benefit pension plan beyond one year has not been included as there are several significant factors  such as the future market value of plan assets and projected investment return rates  which could cause actual funding requirements to differ materially from projected funding 
e the company is actively engaged in efforts to resell the former australia sh g a now designated the sh g i aircraft  spare parts and equipment to other potential customers 
pursuant to the terms of its revenue sharing agreement with the commonwealth of australia  the company will share all proceeds from the resale of the aircraft  spare parts  and equipment with the commonwealth on a predetermined basis  and total payments of at least million aud must be made to the commonwealth regardless of sales 
cumulative payments of million aud have been made through december  an additional payment of million aud must be paid on march   to the extent that cumulative payments have not yet reached million aud as of that date 
off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes the company s off balance sheet arrangements payments due by period in millions total within year years years more than years acquisition earn out total the obligation to pay earn out amounts depends upon the attainment of specific milestones for kpp orlando  an operation acquired in the company currently maintains million in outstanding standby letters of credit under the credit agreement 
of this amount  million is related to the guaranteed minimum payments to australia in connection with the ownership transfer of the sh g a helicopters along with spare parts and associated equipment 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosures based upon historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant 
we are also responsible for evaluating the propriety of our estimates  judgments  and accounting methods as new events occur 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management periodically reviews the company s critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the most significant areas currently involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
long term contracts methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions for long term aerospace contracts  we generally recognize sales and income based on the percentage of completion method of accounting  which allows for recognition of revenue as work on a contract progresses 
we recognize sales and profit based upon either the cost to cost method  in which sales and profit are recorded based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs to complete the contract  or the units of delivery method  in which sales are recognized as deliveries are made and cost of sales is computed on the basis of the estimated ratio of total cost to total sales 
management performs detailed quarterly reviews of all of our significant long term contracts 
based upon these reviews  we record the effects of adjustments in profit estimates each period 
if at any time management determines that in the case of a particular contract total costs will exceed total contract revenue  we record a provision for the entire anticipated contract loss at that time 
the percentage of completion method requires that we estimate future revenues and costs over the life of a contract 
revenues are estimated based upon the original contract price  with consideration being given to exercised contract options  change orders and in some cases projected customer requirements 
contract costs may be incurred over a period of several years  and the estimation of these costs requires significant judgment based upon the acquired knowledge and experience of program managers  engineers  and financial professionals 
estimated costs are based primarily on anticipated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
the complexity of certain programs as well as technical risks and uncertainty as to the future availability of materials and labor resources could affect the company s ability to accurately estimate future contract costs 
while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to calculate our long term revenues and costs  estimating the percentage of work complete on certain programs is a complex task 
as a result  changes to these estimates could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
these programs include the sikorsky canadian mh program  the sikorsky black hawk program  the jpf program  the boeing a program  our bell helicopter programs and several other programs 
estimating the ultimate total cost of these programs is challenging due to the complexity of the programs  the increase in production of new programs  the nature of the materials needed to complete these programs  change orders related to the programs and the need to manage our customers expectations 
these programs are an important element in our continuing strategy to increase operating efficiencies and profitability as well as broaden our business base 
management continues to monitor and update program cost estimates quarterly for these contracts 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more of these programs could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the net decrease in our operating income from changes in contract estimates totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  allowance for doubtful accounts methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivable balance 
these estimates are based on known past due amounts and historical write off experience  as well as trends and factors impacting the credit risk associated with specific customers 
in an effort to identify adverse trends for trade receivables  we perform ongoing reviews of account balances and the aging of receivables 
amounts are considered past due when payment has not been received within a pre determined time frame based upon the credit terms extended 
for our government and commercial contracts  we evaluate  on an ongoing basis  the amount of recoverable costs 
the recoverability of costs is evaluated on a contract by contract basis based upon historical trends of payments  program viability and the customer s credit worthiness 
write offs are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts only after we have exhausted all collection efforts 
actual write offs and adjustments could differ from the allowance estimates due to unanticipated changes in the business environment as well as factors and risks associated with specific customers 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
receivables written off  net of recoveries  in and were million and million  respectively 
currently we do not believe that we have a significant amount of risk relative to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a change in the allowance would have a million effect on pre tax earnings 
inventory valuation methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have four types of inventory a merchandise for resale  b contracts in process  c other work in process  and d finished goods 
merchandise for resale is stated at the lower of the cost of the inventory or its fair market value 
contracts in process  other work in process and finished goods are valued at production cost comprised of material  labor and overhead  including general and administrative expenses on certain government contracts 
contracts in process  other work in process  and finished goods are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we include raw material amounts in the contracts in process and other work in process balances 
raw material includes certain general stock materials but primarily relates to purchases that were made in anticipation of specific programs that have not been started as of the balance sheet date 
the total amount of raw material included in these in process amounts was less than of the total inventory balance as of both december  and the process for evaluating inventory obsolescence or market value often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
we adjust our inventory by the difference between the estimated market value and the actual cost of our inventory to arrive at net realizable value 
changes in estimates of future sales volume may necessitate future write downs of inventory value 
the k max inventory balance  consisting of work in process and finished goods  was million as of december  we believe that it is stated at net realizable value  although lack of demand for spare parts in the future could result in additional write downs of the inventory value 
overall  management believes that our inventory is appropriately valued and not subject to further obsolescence in the near term 
on february   we completed the transfer of title to the australian sh g a super seasprite helicopters  including related inventory and equipment 
at december   million of sh g i  formerly sh g a  inventory was included in contracts and other work in process inventory 
we believe there is market potential for these aircraft and we are actively marketing them to interested potential customers  however  a significant portion of this inventory will be sold after december   based upon the time needed to market the aircraft and prepare them for sale 
inventory valuation at our distribution segment generally requires less subjective management judgment than the valuation of certain inventory in the aerospace segment 
management reviews the k max inventory balance on an annual basis to determine whether any additional write downs are necessary 
if such a write down were to occur  this could have a significant impact on our operating results 
a write down of the december   inventory balance would have affected pre tax earnings by approximately million in management reviewed the sh g i inventory balance at december   to determine that no write down was necessary 
if such a write down were to occur  this could have a significant impact on our operating results 
a write down of the december   inventory balance would have affected pre tax earnings by approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and certain intangible assets that have indefinite lives are evaluated at least annually for impairment 
the annual evaluation is generally performed during the fourth quarter  using forecast information 
all intangible assets are also reviewed for possible impairment whenever changes in conditions indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its carrying value 
in the distribution segment  this testing is conducted at the segment level as no components represent reporting units 
in the aerospace segment  testing is conducted at a level one level below the segment level  and components are not aggregated for purposes of goodwill testing 
the carrying value of goodwill as of december   was million and million for the distribution and aerospace segments  respectively 
the aerospace specific reporting units contributing to the total goodwill balance were as follows kpp orlando  million  rwg  million  kaman engineering services  million  vt composites  million  and uk composites  million 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  net  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these assets 
the carrying value of other intangible assets as of december   was million and million for the distribution and aerospace segments  respectively 
in determining whether events or circumstances indicated it was necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test  management considered the following qualitative factors  general economic conditions in the markets served by the reporting units carrying goodwill  relevant industry specific performance statistics  changes in the carrying value of the individual reporting units  and assumptions used in the most recent fair value calculation  including forecasted results of operations  the weighted average cost of capital and recent transaction multiples 
the results of management assessment indicated that we were required to complete the two step test for vt composites and uk composites 
in all other cases  evidence suggested that the fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value 
management estimated the fair value of the two reporting units using an income methodology based on management estimates of forecasted cash flows  with those cash flows discounted to present value using rates commensurate with the risks of those cash flows 
in addition  management used a market based valuation method involving analysis of market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for i a group of comparable public companies and ii recent transactions  if any  involving comparable companies 
assumptions used by management were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing valuations of our reporting units 
in performing our test we used an assumed terminal growth rate of for these reporting units 
the discount rate utilized to reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets and specifically in our internally developed earnings projections ranged from for these reporting units 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our tests for goodwill impairment 
for the reporting units subject to the two step goodwill test  management performed a sensitivity analysis relative to the discount rate and growth rate selected 
we performed the step one test for these units and the percentage by which the fair value exceeds the carrying value is for vt composites and for uk composites 
a decrease of in our terminal growth rates or an increase of in our discount rates would not result in a fair value calculation less than the carrying value for either reporting unit 
additionally  a decrease in the fair value of these reporting units also would not have resulted in fair value calculations less than the carrying values 
as with all assumptions  there is an inherent level of uncertainty and actual results that are different could have a material impact on our fair value 
for example  multiples for similar type reporting units could deteriorate due to changes in technology or a downturn in economic conditions 
a reduction in customer demand would impact our assumed growth rate resulting in a reduced fair value 
potential events or circumstances could have a negative effect on the estimated fair value 
the loss of a major customer or program would have a significant impact on the future cash flows of the reporting unit 
advances in technology by our competitors could result in our products becoming obsolete 
we do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
long term incentive programs methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions the company maintains a stock incentive plan  which provides for share based payment awards  including non statutory stock options  restricted stock  stock appreciation rights  and long term incentive program ltip awards 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using a black scholes model 
we determine the fair value of our restricted share awards at the date of grant using an average of the high and low market price of our stock 
ltip awards provide certain senior executives an opportunity to receive award payments  generally in cash 
for each performance cycle  the company s financial results are compared to the russell indices for the same periods based upon the following a average return on total capital  b earnings per share growth and c total return to shareholders 
no awards will be payable unless the company s performance is at least in the th percentile of the designated indices 
the maximum award is payable if performance reaches the th percentile of the designated indices 
awards for performance between the th and th percentiles are determined by straight line interpolation 
awards will be paid out at at the th percentile 
in order to estimate the liability associated with ltip awards  management must make assumptions as to how our current performance compares to current russell data based upon the russell s historical results 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis 
when sufficient russell data for a year is available  which typically will not be until may or june of the following year  management will adjust the liability to reflect its best estimate of the total award 
actual results could differ significantly from management s estimates 
the total estimated liability as of december   was million 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
our long term incentive plan requires management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving long term company goals as well as estimate the impact the russell results may have on our accrual 
we do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   would have affected pre tax earnings by approximately million in due to the timing of availability of the russell data  there is a risk that the amount we have recorded as ltip expense could be different from the actual payout 
a percentage point increase in the total performance factor earned for our ltip would result in a reduction of pretax earnings of million 
pension plans methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension  as well as a non qualified supplemental employees retirement plan serp  for certain key executives 
see note  pension plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further discussion of these plans 
expenses and liabilities associated with each of these plans are determined based upon actuarial valuations 
integral to these actuarial valuations are a variety of assumptions including expected return on plan assets and discount rate 
we regularly review these assumptions  which are updated at the measurement date  december st 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the impact of differences between actual results and the assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods  which will affect expense recognized in future periods 
the discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension obligation 
for  management reviewed the citigroup pension discount curve and liability index to determine the continued appropriateness of our discount rate assumptions 
this index was designed to provide a market average discount rate to assist plan sponsors in valuing the liabilities associated with postretirement obligations 
additionally  we reviewed the changes in the general level of interest rates since the last measurement date noting that overall rates had decreased when compared with based upon this information  we used a discount rate as of december   for the qualified defined benefit pension plan 
this rate takes into consideration the participants in our pension plan and the anticipated payment stream as compared to the citigroup index and rounds the results to the nearest fifth basis point 
for the serp  we used the same methodology as the pension plan and derived a discount rate of in for the benefit obligation 
the difference in the discount rates is primarily due to the expected duration of serp payments  which is shorter than the anticipated duration of benefit payments to be made to the average participant in the pension plan 
the qualified defined benefit pension plan and serp used discount rates of and at december   respectively  for purposes of calculating the benefit obligation 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated benefit payments 
the expected return on assets assumption is developed based upon several factors 
such factors include current and expected target asset allocation  our historical experience of returns by asset class type  a risk premium and an inflation estimate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension expense in by million 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension expense in by million 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense 
for  the expected rate of return on plan assets was reduced to from 
the reduction was primarily driven by the changes in the allocation targets of our investments during the year 
a one percentage point increase decrease in the assumed return on pension plan assets assumption would have changed pension expense in by approximately million 
during the actual return on pension plan assets was significantly higher than our expected rate of return on pension plan assets of 
income taxes methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions tax laws in certain of our operating jurisdictions require items to be reported for tax purposes at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements 
one example of such temporary differences is depreciation expense 
other differences are permanent  such as expenses that are never deductible on our tax returns  an example being a charge related to the impairment of goodwill 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as tax deductions or credits in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment is not yet due or the realized tax benefit of expenses we have already reported in our tax returns  but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
as of december   we had recognized million of deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
the realization of these benefits is dependent in part on future taxable income 
for those us states where the expiration of tax loss or credit carryforwards or the projected operating results indicates that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
management believes that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize deferred income tax assets  net of valuation allowances recorded 
the realization of these deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws or statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was for our effective tax rate is based on expected or reported income or loss  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are valid and defensible  we believe that certain positions may not prevail if challenged 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit or changes in tax legislation 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate 
this rate is then applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item 
we do not anticipate a significant change in our unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
we file tax returns in numerous us and foreign jurisdictions  with returns subject to examination for varying periods  but generally back to and including it is our policy to record interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income taxes 
a one percent increase decrease in our tax rate would affect our earnings by million 
environmental costs methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations 
as a result  we have established and update  as necessary  policies relating to environmental standards of performance for our operations worldwide 
when we become aware of an environmental risk  we perform a site study to ascertain the potential magnitude of contamination and the estimated cost of remediation 
this cost is accrued using a reasonable discount factor based on the estimated future cost of remediation 
we continually evaluate the identified environmental issues to ensure the time to complete the remediation and the total cost of remediation are consistent with our initial estimate 
if there is any change in the cost and or timing of remediation  the accrual is adjusted accordingly 
environmental costs are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
liabilities with fixed or readily determinable payment dates are discounted 
we believe that expenditures necessary to comply with the present regulations governing environmental protection will not have a material effect upon our competitive position  consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   amounts accrued for known environmental remediation costs were million 
a change in this accrual would have impacted pre tax earnings by million 
further information about our environmental costs is provided in note  environmental costs  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting standards a summary of recent accounting standards is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in
