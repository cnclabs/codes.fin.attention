overview company background bluelinx is a leading distributor of building products in the united states 
as of december   we distributed approximately  products from over suppliers to service approximately  customers nationwide  including dealers  industrial manufacturers  manufactured housing producers and home improvement retailers 
we operate our distribution business from sales centers in atlanta and denver  and our network of approximately distribution centers 
we distribute products in two principal categories structural products and specialty products 
structural products include plywood  osb  rebar and remesh  lumber and other wood products primarily used for structural support  walls and flooring in construction projects 
structural products represented approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively

specialty products accounted for approximately and of our fiscal and fiscal gross sales  respectively 

table of contents industry conditions we operate in a changing environment in which new risks can emerge from time to time 
a number of factors cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
many of these factors are seasonal or cyclical in nature 
conditions in the united states us housing market continue to be at historically low levels 
our operating results have declined during the past several years as they are closely tied to us housing starts 
additionally  the mortgage markets have experienced substantial disruption due to an unprecedented number of defaults in the subprime market 
this disruption and the related defaults have increased the inventory of homes for sale and also have caused lenders to tighten mortgage qualification criteria  which further reduces demand for new homes 
while there has been some recent improvement  we expect the lower than historical average level of new housing activity will continue to negatively impact our operating results 
we continue to prudently manage our inventories  receivables and spending in this environment 
however  along with many forecasters  we believe that we are in the beginning of a housing recovery and that us housing demand will continue to improve in the long term based on population demographics and a variety of other factors 
as the housing market and general economic conditions continue to improve  the company believes that additional capital would allow the company to participate more fully in these improving conditions  and therefore the company currently is seeking additional capital 
the company s sales depend heavily on the strength of national and local new residential construction and home improvement and remodeling markets  which are showing signs of significant improvement 
moreover  the government s legislative and administrative measures aimed at restoring liquidity to the credit markets and providing relief to homeowners facing foreclosure are beginning to show positive results 
the overall housing market and economy are also improving  which is expected to lead to a considerable increase in residential construction and  to a lesser extent  in home improvement activity 
if the company and its industry continue to recover from the historic housing market downturn  the company expects its sales to improve and therefore its need for inventory and its accounts receivable to increase 
this increase in working capital is expected to use some of the company s current excess availability under its revolving credit facilities 
stock rights offerings on january   we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec for a planned rights offering of our common stock to our stockholders  which seeks to raise gross proceeds of million 
in addition to being able to purchase their pro rata portion of the shares offered based on their ownership as of the record date for the rights offering  stockholders may oversubscribe for additional shares of common stock 
the estimated net proceeds from the rights offering of approximately million will be used to pay down the us revolving credit facility 
cerberus abp investor llc cerberus  the company s majority stockholder  has indicated that it intends  subject to the exercise price of the rights being set at an acceptable amount  to exercise all of the rights issued to it and to subscribe for the maximum additional shares pursuant to the over subscription privilege that it would be entitled to purchase 
however  such indication is not binding  and cerberus is not legally obligated to do so 
the company anticipates that the record date and the subscription price will be determined at or about the time that the sec declares the company s registration statement effective 
on july   we concluded an offering of our common stock to our stockholders the rights offering  pursuant to which we distributed to our common stockholders transferable rights to subscribe for and purchase up to million of our common stock 
the rights offering was fully subscribed and resulted in gross proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds from the rights offering were approximately million  and million of the net proceeds were used to pay down the us revolving credit facility 
we accounted for the rights issued as a component of additional paid in capital as they were indexed to the company s equity and there were no net cash settlement provisions 
private label products on february   our three year purchase agreement with g p for engineered lumber expired in accordance with its terms 
in february of  we launched our own privately branded engineered product line for all geographic markets other than new england 
in addition  on february  we entered into a distribution agreement with weyerhaeuser company for the sale of certain engineered wood products in the new england region 
we have subsequently increased the number of private label products that we offer to customers and currently offer several products under our private labels 

table of contents restructuring charges during fiscal  we announced a plan to adjust our cost structure in order to manage our costs more effectively 
the plan included the consolidation of our corporate headquarters and sales center to one building from two buildings which resulted in certain charges recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into an amendment to our corporate headquarters lease in atlanta  georgia related to the unoccupied building 
this amendment released us from our obligations with respect to this unoccupied space as of january   in exchange for a million space remittance fee  which was paid in the first quarter of we also paid million in the third quarter of fiscal and are obligated to pay an additional million on or before december  related to contractually obligated tenant improvement reimbursement expense 
the provisions relating to the occupied building remain unchanged 
under the existing provisions  the current term of the lease ends on january  the amendment resulted in a reduction of our restructuring reserve of approximately million  with the credit recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations during fiscal selected factors that affect our operating results our operating results are affected by housing starts  mobile home production  industrial production  repair and remodeling spending and non residential construction 
we believe a substantial percentage of our sales are directly related to new home construction 
our operating results also are impacted by changes in product prices 
structural products prices can vary significantly based on short term and long term changes in supply and demand 
the prices of specialty products also can vary from time to time  although they generally are significantly less variable than structural products

seasonality we are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors 
these seasonal factors are common in the building products distribution industry 
the first and fourth quarters are typically our slowest quarters due to the impact of poor weather on the construction market

if we fail to maintain this minimum excess availability  the amended us revolving credit facility requires us to i maintain certain financial ratios  which we would not meet with current operating results  triggering the lender s right to make the debt callable  and ii limit our capital expenditures  which would have a negative impact on our ability to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures 

table of contents in the event that excess availability falls below million or of the lesser of the borrowing base or million  the us revolving credit facility gives the lenders the right to dominion of our bank accounts

while the company believes that the amounts currently available from its revolving credit facilities and other sources will be sufficient to fund its routine operations and capital requirements for at least the next months  the company believes that additional capital will provide it with a stronger liquidity position and allow it to more fully participate in the improving housing market 
the company believes that this stronger liquidity position will also give the company an advantage over many competitors that have less liquidity and less or no access to additional capital  and therefore may not be able to fully participate in the opportunities that arise in a growing market

table of contents purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table 
amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets to the extent entered into prior to the end of the applicable period as accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make judgments and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our management believes that we consistently apply these judgments and estimates and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any differences between these judgments and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and financial position 
critical accounting estimates  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting estimates include those regarding revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  income taxes  defined benefit pension plans  and stock based compensation 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to the buyer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated as fob free on board shipping point 
for sales transactions designated fob destination  revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer s delivery site 
all revenues are recorded at gross 
the key indicators used to determine when and how revenue is recorded are as follows we are the primary obligor responsible for fulfillment and all other aspects of the customer relationship 
title passes to bluelinx  and we carry all risk of loss related to warehouse  reload inventory and inventory shipped directly from vendors to our customers 
we are responsible for all product returns 
we control the selling price for all channels 
we select the supplier 
we bear all credit risk 
in addition  we provide inventory to certain customers through pre arranged agreements on a consignment basis 
customer consigned inventory is maintained and stored by certain customers  however  ownership and risk of loss remains with us 
when the inventory is sold by the customer  we recognize revenue on a gross basis 
all revenues recognized are net of trade allowances  cash discounts and sales returns 
cash discounts and sales returns are estimated using historical experience 
trade allowances are based on the estimated obligations and historical experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on discounts and returns have been insignificant for each of the reported periods 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts and related reserves we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers and their creditworthiness 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for each aging category on our aged trial balance based on our historical loss experience 
this estimate is periodically adjusted when we become aware of specific customers inability to meet their financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or other evidence of liquidity problems 
as we determine that specific balances will ultimately be uncollectible  we remove them from our aged trial balance 
additionally  we maintain reserves for cash discounts that we expect customers to earn as well as expected returns 
inventory valuation inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of all inventories is determined by the moving average cost method 
we include all charges directly or indirectly incurred in bringing inventory to its existing condition and location 
we evaluate our inventory value at the end of each quarter to ensure that first quality  actively moving inventory  when viewed by category  is carried at the lower of cost or market 
additionally  we maintain a reserve for the estimated value impairment associated with damaged  excess and obsolete inventory 
the damaged  excess and obsolete reserve generally includes discontinued items or inventory that has turn days in excess of days  excluding new items during their product launch 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets with definite useful lives  are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we consider whether there were indicators of potential impairment on a quarterly basis 
indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses  management s decision to exit a facility  reductions in the fair market value of real properties and changes in other circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our evaluation of long lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows  which is generally the individual distribution facility 
in the event of indicators of impairment  the assets of the distribution facility are evaluated by comparing the facility s undiscounted cash flows over the estimated useful life of the asset  which ranges between years  to its carrying value 
if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the estimated fair market value 
impairment losses are recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
our estimate of undiscounted cash flows is subject to assumptions that affect estimated operating income at a distribution facility level 
these assumptions are related to future sales  margin growth rates  economic conditions  market competition and inflation 
in the event that undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of a facility  our estimates of fair market value are generally based on market appraisals and our experience with related market transactions 
we use a two year average of cash flows based on ebitda and projected ebitda  which includes a growth factor assumption  to estimate undiscounted cash flows 
these assumptions used to determine impairment are considered to be level measurements in the fair value hierarchy as defined in note 
table of contents our operating results have declined during the past several years as they are closely tied to us housing starts  which have been at historically low levels 
during fiscal  we began to see signs of a housing recovery and our results have improved  however our sales are still at historically low levels 
to the extent that reductions in volume and operating income have resulted in impairment indicators  in all cases our carrying values continue to be less than our projected undiscounted cash flows 
as such  we have not identified significant known trends impacting the fair value of long lived assets to an extent that would indicate impairment 
during the first quarter of fiscal our newtown  connecticut facility was damaged due to severe winter weather 
as a result of the damage to the facility and its contents  we have received approximately million in proceeds from the insurance company comprised of million related to the damaged building  million related to damaged and destroyed inventory and million related to the recovery of additional expenses incurred as a result of the damage 
cash received related to the damaged building was classified as an investing cash inflow in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended december  and used to reduce the principal of our mortgage  which was classified as a financing cash outflow 
all other cash inflows related to the insurance settlement were classified as operating cash flows in our consolidated statement of cash flows in the appropriate period 
the majority of the remaining cash inflows were used to fund costs incurred related to the newtown loss 
we recognized a million gain in fiscal of which million related to the damaged building and million related to the recovery of gross margin on the inventory 
we recorded an additional gain of million related to the damaged building during the second quarter of we recorded all gains related to the events above at the time the recovery of the minimum expected proceeds under our insurance policy became probable and was estimable 
these gains were recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes the federal statutory income tax rate was 
our provision for benefit from income taxes is reconciled to the federal statutory amount as follows fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended january  in thousands benefit from income taxes computed at the federal statutory tax rate benefit from state income taxes  net of federal benefit valuation allowance change nondeductible items  other provision for benefit from income taxes our income before provision for income taxes for our canadian operations was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal  we recognized tax expense of million 
the expense recognized for the year is primarily comprised of million for current state income tax expense related to earnings generated on a separate company basis 
for fiscal  we recognized tax expense of million 
the expense recognized for the year is primarily comprised of million for current state income tax expense related to earnings generated on a separate company basis and million of current income tax expense resulting from foreign income taxes 
in accordance with the intraperiod tax allocation provisions of us gaap  we are required to consider all items including items recorded in other comprehensive income in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations that should be allocated to continuing operations 
in fiscal and fiscal  there was no intraperiod tax allocation due to the fact that there was a loss in other comprehensive income for the period 
while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported in our consolidated statements of operations  the income tax expense on other comprehensive income is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is a component of stockholders equity 

table of contents as of december   our deferred income tax assets were million  which are offset by a full valuation allowance 
deferred income tax assets and income tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
our financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets which have arisen primarily as a result of tax benefits associated with the loss before income taxes incurred during fiscal and fiscal  as well as net deferred income tax assets resulting from other temporary differences related to certain reserves  pension obligations and differences between book and tax depreciation and amortization 
we record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets when we determine that based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we considered the four sources of taxable income that should be considered when determining whether a valuation allowance is required including from least to most subjective taxable income in prior carryback years  if carryback is permitted under the tax law  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie  offset gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating and non operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income 
substantial changes in these assumptions could result in changes in our judgments around our ability to realize future tax benefit 
defined benefit pension plans we sponsor several defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our hourly employees 
our estimates of the amount and timing of our future funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans are based upon various assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  projected return on plan assets  compensation increase rates  mortality rates  retirement patterns  and turnover rates 
in addition  the amount and timing of our pension funding obligations can be influenced by funding requirements that are established by the employee retirement income and security act of erisa  the pension protection act  congressional acts  or other governing bodies 
during fiscal and  we met our required contribution to our defined benefit pension plans 
we recognize the unfunded status ie  the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of our pension plan in our consolidated balance sheets  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
on december   we measured the fair value of our plan assets and benefit obligations 
as of december  and december   the net unfunded status of our benefit plan was million and million  respectively 
these amounts were included in other non current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the net adjustment to other comprehensive loss for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal was million loss million loss  net of tax  offset by a valuation allowance  million loss million loss  net of tax  offset by a valuation allowance  million loss million loss  net of tax  respectively  which represents the net unrecognized actuarial loss gain and unrecognized prior service cost 
the company s required cash contribution to the pension plan in was approximately million 
the required contribution was comprised of approximately million related to our minimum required contribution and approximately million related to our minimum required contribution 
the company s minimum required contribution for plan year was million 
the company has funded the million related to its minimum required contribution with cash in however  in an effort to preserve additional cash for operations  we applied for a waiver from the irs for our minimum required contribution 
the waiver is still being reviewed by the irs 
we have not made the million of required contributions related to the minimum required contribution 
if we are granted the requested waiver  our contributions for will be amortized over the following five years  increasing our future minimum required contributions 
we are currently required to make three quarterly cash contributions during fiscal of million per quarter related to our minimum required contribution 
we are pursuing contributing personal property to the pension plan during fiscal we will designate the contribution such that it will offset our future minimum required contribution 

table of contents we used a discount rate of to compute the projected benefit obligation  which was determined by matching of plan liability cash flows to a portfolio of bonds 
a change in the discount rate of basis points  from to  while holding all other assumptions constant  would have resulted in a reduction in the company s projected benefit obligation of approximately million in we used an estimated rate of future compensation increases of to compute the projected benefit obligation 
a change in the rate of basis points  from to  while holding all other assumptions constant  would have resulted in an increase in the company s projected benefit obligation of less than million in plan assets are managed as a balanced portfolio comprised of two major components an equity portion and a fixed income portion 
the expected role of plan equity investments will be to maximize the long term real growth of fund assets  while the role of fixed income investments will be to generate current income  provide for more stable periodic returns  and provide some downside protection against the possibility of a prolonged decline in the market value of equity investments 
we review this investment policy statement at least once per year 
in addition  the portfolio will be reviewed quarterly to determine the deviation from target weightings and will be rebalanced as necessary 
target allocations for fiscal are domestic and international equity investments  fixed income investments  and cash 
the expected long term rate of return for the plan s total assets is based on the expected return of each of the above categories  weighted based on the target allocation for each class 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value for all share based payment awards that are expected to vest 
this expense is recorded on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award  unless the awards are subject to market or performance conditions  in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche to the extent market and performance conditions are considered probable 
the calculation of fair value related to stock compensation is subject to certain assumptions discussed in more detail in note management updates such estimates when circumstances warrant 
all compensation expense related to our share based payment awards is recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued guidance which amends existing gaap fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to converge gaap and international financial reporting standards requirements for measuring amounts at fair value as well as disclosures about these measurements 
this guidance is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued guidance which eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the update also requires the presentation of a single statement of comprehensive income or consecutive presentation of the statement of income and the statement of comprehensive income  if a company elects to present two separate statements 
finally  reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income are required to be presented on the face of the financial statements 
the new guidance and subsequent amendment are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we have formally adopted this guidance during fiscal and presented the total of comprehensive income loss  the components of net income loss and the components of other comprehensive income loss in a single continuous statement on the face of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
there were no other accounting pronouncements adopted during fiscal that had a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
we are exposed to risks such as changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we employ a variety of practices to manage these risks including the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading  and are not used to address risks related to foreign currency exchange rates 
we record derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding our market risk exposure 
interest rates 
our revolving credit facilities accrue interest based on a floating benchmark rate the prime rate or libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
a change in interest rates under the revolving credit facility would have an impact on our results of operations 
however  a change of basis points in the market rate of interest would have an impact of million and million based on borrowings outstanding at december  and december   respectively  which we do not believe to be material 
additionally  to the extent changes in interest rates impact the housing market  we would be impacted by such changes 
we have a million mortgage loan with the german american capital corporation 
the mortgage has a term of ten years and a fixed interest rate of 
by entering into this fixed rate mortgage  we insulated ourselves from changes in market interest rates on a portion of our indebtedness 
this mortgage replaced our previously existing million floating rate mortgage  which had a interest rate when it was terminated 
foreign exchange rates 
less than of our net sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and we do not believe our total exposure to currency fluctuations to be significant 
commodity prices 
we believe that general inflation did not significantly affect our operating results or markets in fiscal  fiscal or fiscal as discussed above  our results of operations were both favorably and unfavorably impacted by increases and decreases in the pricing of certain commodity based products 
commodity price fluctuations have from time to time created cyclicality in our financial performance and may do so in the future 
for the year ended december   we believe that a change in the prices underlying our commodity based products would have resulted in a million  million and million change in revenue  cost of sales and gross margin  respectively 
for the year ended december   we believe that a change in the prices underlying our commodity based products would result in a million  million and million change in revenue  cost of sales and gross margin  respectively
