we believe that a number of factors and strategies will enable us to continue to achieve our objectives of long term sustainable growth in net operating income defined below and ffo defined below as well as maximization of long term stockholder value 
these factors and strategies include the quality and location of our properties  our ability to efficiently manage our assets as a low cost provider of commercial real estate through our seasoned management team possessing core capabilities in all aspects of real estate ownership  including property management  leasing  marketing  financing  accounting  legal  construction and development management  our ability to capitalize on inflection points in a real estate cycle to add quality assets to our portfolio at substantial discounts to long term value  through either acquisition  development or redevelopment  our strong financial position that has and will continue to allow us to pursue attractive acquisition and development and redevelopment opportunities  our access to development  redevelopment  acquisition  and leasing opportunities as a result of our extensive experience and significant working relationships with major west coast property owners  corporate tenants  municipalities  and landowners given our over year presence in the west coast markets  our capital recycling program see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity sources for additional information pertaining to the company capital recycling program and related property dispositions  and our future development pipeline of undeveloped land sites 
net operating income is defined as operating revenues rental income  tenant reimbursements  and other property income less property and related expenses property expenses  real estate taxes  provision for bad debts  and ground leases before depreciation 
ffo is funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations and non gaap supplemental financial measures funds from operations for a reconciliation of these measures to generally accepted accounting principles gaap net income available to common stockholders 
operating strategies 
we focus on enhancing long term growth in net operating income and ffo from our properties by maximizing cash flow from our properties through active leasing  early renewals  and effective property management  structuring leases to maximize returns and internal growth  managing portfolio credit risk through effective underwriting  including the use of credit enhancements and interests in collateral to mitigate portfolio credit risk  managing operating expenses through the efficient use of internal management  leasing  marketing  financing  accounting  legal  and construction management functions  maintaining and developing long term relationships with a diverse tenant base  managing our properties to offer the maximum degree of utility and operational efficiency to tenants  building substantially all of our recent development projects to leadership in energy and environmental design leed specifications  achieving gold or silver certification levels for several of our buildings  including the first leed platinum ground up commercial development in san francisco at mission street  actively pursuing leed certification for over million square feet of office space within our existing portfolio  aggressively pursuing high performance environmental building initiatives that create economic value for our tenants  shareholders and employees  continuing to effectively manage capital improvements to enhance our properties competitive advantages in their respective markets and improve the efficiency of building systems  enhancing our management team with individuals who have extensive regional experience and are highly knowledgeable in their respective markets  and attracting and retaining motivated employees by providing financial and other incentives to meet our operating and financial goals 
acquisition strategies 
we believe we are well positioned to acquire properties and development and redevelopment opportunities as the result of our extensive experience  strong financial position  and ability to access capital 
we continue to actively monitor our target markets and focus on acquiring additional high quality office properties and development and redevelopment opportunities that provide attractive yields and significant potential for growth in cash flow from property operations  present growth opportunities in our existing or other strategic markets  and demonstrate the potential for improved performance through intensive management  repositioning and leasing that should result in increased occupancy and rental revenues 
development and redevelopment strategies 
we and our predecessors have developed office and industrial properties primarily located in california since as of december   our future development pipeline was comprised of nine potential development sites  representing gross acres of undeveloped land on which we believe we have the potential to develop over two million rentable square feet of office space  depending upon economic conditions 
our strategy with respect to development is to maintain a disciplined approach by emphasizing pre leasing  commencing development in stages  or phasing  and cost control  continue to execute our build to suit philosophy in which we develop properties to be leased by specific committed tenants providing for lower risk development  be the premier provider of modern and collaborative office buildings on the west coast  reinvest capital from dispositions of nonstrategic assets into new state of the market development and acquisition assets with higher cash flow and rates of return  evaluate redevelopment opportunities in supply constrained markets because such efforts generally achieve similar returns to new development with reduced entitlement risk and shorter construction periods  and execute on our development projects under construction and our future development pipeline 
redevelopment opportunities are those projects in which we spend significant development and construction costs on existing buildings pursuant to a formal plan  the intended result of which is a higher economic return on the property 
we may engage in the additional development or redevelopment of office properties when market conditions support a favorable risk adjusted return on such development or redevelopment 
we expect that our significant working relationships with tenants  municipalities  and landowners on the west coast will give us further access to development and redevelopment opportunities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop or redevelop any of our properties or that we will have access to additional development or redevelopment opportunities 
financing strategies 
our financing policies and objectives are determined by our board of directors 
our goal is to limit our dependence on leverage and maintain a conservative ratio of debt to total market capitalization 
as of december   our total debt as a percentage of total market capitalization was  and our total debt and liquidation value of our preferred equity as a percentage of total market capitalization was  both of which were calculated based on the quoted closing price per share of the company common stock of on december  see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources of the company capitalization for additional information 
our financing strategies include maintaining financial flexibility  including a low secured to unsecured debt ratio  to maximize our ability to access a variety of both public and private capital sources  maintaining a staggered debt maturity schedule in which the maturity dates of our debt are spread over several years to limit risk exposure at any particular point in the capital and credit market cycles  completing financing in advance of the need for capital  and managing interest rate exposure by generally maintaining a greater amount of fixed rate debt as compared to variable rate debt 
we utilize multiple sources of capital  including borrowings under our unsecured line of credit  proceeds from the issuance of public or private debt or equity securities and other bank and or institutional borrowings  and dispositions of nonstrategic assets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain capital as needed on terms favorable to us or at all 
see the discussion under the caption item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may influence future results of operations and item a risk factors 
significant tenants as of december   our largest tenants in terms of annualized base rental revenues represented approximately of our total annualized base rental revenues  defined as annualized monthly contractual rents from existing tenants as of december  annualized base rental revenue includes the impact of straight lining rent escalations and the amortization of free rent periods and excludes the impact of the following amortization of deferred revenue related tenant funded tenant improvements  amortization of above below market rents  amortization for lease incentives due under existing leases  and expense reimbursement revenue

segment and geographic financial information for the year ended december   we only had one segment  our office properties segment 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our entire portfolio of industrial properties and  as a result  no longer owned any industrial properties at december  for information about our office property revenues and long lived assets and other financial information  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report and item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
all of our properties are located and all of our business is currently conducted in the state of california with the exception of the ownership and operation of ten office properties located in the state of washington 
employees as of december   we employed people through the operating partnership  ksllc  and kilroy realty trs  inc we believe that relations with our employees are good 
environmental regulations and potential liabilities government regulation relating to the environment 
many laws and governmental regulations relating to the environment are applicable to our properties  and changes in these laws and regulations  or their interpretation by agencies and the courts  occur frequently and may adversely affect us 
existing conditions at some of our properties 
independent environmental consultants have conducted phase i or similar environmental site assessments on all of our properties 
we generally obtain these assessments prior to the acquisition of a property and may later update them as required for subsequent financing of the property or as requested by a tenant 
site assessments are generally performed to american society for testing and materials standards then existing for phase i site assessments and typically include a historical review  a public records review  a visual inspection of the surveyed site  and the issuance of a written report 
these assessments do not generally include any soil samplings or subsurface investigations 
depending on the age of the property  the phase i may have included an assessment of asbestos containing materials 
for properties where asbestos containing materials were identified or suspected  an operations and maintenance plan was generally prepared and implemented 
historical operations at or near some of our properties  including the presence of underground or above ground storage tanks  may have caused soil or groundwater contamination 
in some instances  the prior owners of the affected properties conducted remediation of known contamination in the soils on our properties  and we do not believe that further clean up of the soils is required 
we are not aware of any such condition  liability  or concern by any other means that would give rise to material environmental liability 
however  the assessments may have failed to reveal all environmental conditions  liabilities  or compliance concerns  there may be material environmental conditions  liabilities  or compliance concerns that arose at a property after the review was completed  future laws  ordinances  or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability  and environmental conditions at our properties may be affected in the future by tenants  third parties  or the condition of land or operations near our properties  such as the presence of underground storage tanks 
we cannot be certain that costs of future environmental compliance will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders 
use of hazardous materials by some of our tenants 
some of our tenants handle hazardous substances and wastes on our properties as part of their routine operations 
environmental laws and regulations may subject these tenants  and potentially us  to liability resulting from such activities 
we generally require our tenants in their leases to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities 
as of december   other than routine cleaning materials  approximately of our tenants handled hazardous substances and or wastes on less than of the aggregate square footage of our properties as part of their routine operations 
these tenants are primarily involved in the life sciences business 
the hazardous substances and wastes are primarily comprised of diesel fuel for emergency generators and small quantities of lab and light manufacturing chemicals including  but not limited to  alcohol  ammonia  carbon dioxide  cryogenic gases  dichlorophenol  methane  naturalyte acid  nitrogen  nitrous oxide  and oxygen which are routinely used by life science companies 
we are not aware of any material noncompliance  liability  or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products in connection with any of our properties  and management does not believe that on going activities by our tenants will have a material adverse effect on our operations 
costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters 
under applicable environmental laws and regulations  we may be liable for the costs of removal  remediation  or disposal of certain hazardous or toxic substances present or released on our properties 
these laws could impose liability without regard to whether we are responsible for  or even knew of  the presence or release of the hazardous materials 
government investigations and remediation actions may have substantial costs  and the presence or release of hazardous substances on a property could result in governmental clean up actions  personal injury actions  or similar claims by private plaintiffs 
potential environmental liabilities may exceed our environmental insurance coverage limits or transactional indemnities 
we carry what we believe to be commercially reasonable environmental insurance 
our environmental insurance policies are subject to various terms  conditions and exclusions 
similarly  in connection with some transactions we obtain environmental indemnities that may not be honored by the indemnitors or may fail to address resulting liabilities adequately 
therefore  we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage or transactional indemnities will be sufficient or that our liability  if any  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to security holders 
item a risk factors the following section sets forth material factors that may adversely affect our business and operations 
the following factors  as well as the factors discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may influence future results of operations and other information contained in this report  should be considered in evaluating us and our business 
risks related to our business and operations global market and economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and those of our tenants 
in the united states  market and economic conditions continue to be challenging with stricter regulations and modest growth 
while recent economic data reflects moderate economic growth in the united states  the cost and availability of credit may continue to be adversely affected by governmental budget and global economic factors 
concern about continued stability of the economy and credit markets generally  and the strength of counterparties specifically  has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce and  in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
volatility in the us and international capital markets and concern over a return to recessionary conditions in global economies  and in the california economy in particular  may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the liquidity and financial condition of our tenants 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability and the ability of our tenants to timely refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
all of our properties are located in california and greater seattle  washington and we may therefore be susceptible to adverse economic conditions and regulations  as well as natural disasters  in those areas 
because all of our properties are concentrated in california and seattle  washington we may be exposed to greater economic risks than if we owned a more geographically dispersed portfolio 
further  within california  our properties are concentrated in los angeles  orange county  san diego county  and the san francisco bay area  exposing us to risks associated with those specific areas 
we are susceptible to adverse developments in the economic and regulatory environments of california and greater seattle  washington such as business layoffs or downsizing  industry slowdowns  relocations of businesses  increases in real estate and other taxes  costs of complying with governmental regulations or increased regulation and other factors as well as adverse weather conditions and natural disasters that occur in these areas such as earthquakes  wind  landslides  fires and other events 
in addition  california is also regarded as more litigious and more highly regulated and taxed than many other states  which may reduce demand for office space in california 
any adverse developments in the economy or real estate market in california and the surrounding region  or in seattle  washington or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the california or seattle regulatory or business environment could impact our ability to generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses or other obligations  which would adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  the quoted trading price of the company common stock and of the operating partnership publicly traded notes and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
our performance and the market value of our securities are subject to risks associated with our investments in real estate assets and with trends in the real estate industry 
our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and  consequently the market value of the company securities  are subject to the risk that our properties may not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses or other obligations 
a deficiency of this nature would adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
events and conditions applicable to owners and operators of real estate that are beyond our control and could impact our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets may include local oversupply or reduction in demand for office or other commercial space  which may result in decreasing rental rates and greater concessions to tenants  inability to collect rent from tenants  vacancies or inability to rent space on favorable terms or at all  inability to finance property development and acquisitions on favorable terms or at all  increased operating costs  including insurance premiums  utilities  and real estate taxes  costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations  the relative illiquidity of real estate investments  changing submarket demographics  the development of harmful mold or other airborne toxins or contaminants that could damage our properties or expose us to third party liabilities  and property damage resulting from seismic activity or other natural disasters 
we depend upon significant tenants and the loss of a significant tenant could adversely affect our financial condition  revenues and results of operations 
as of december   our largest tenants represented approximately of total annualized base rental revenues 
see further discussion on the composition of our tenants by industry and our largest tenants under item properties significant tenants 
our financial condition  results of operations  ability to borrow funds  and cash flows would be adversely affected if any of our significant tenants fails to renew its lease s  renew its lease s on terms less favorable to us  or becomes bankrupt or insolvent or otherwise unable to satisfy its lease obligations 
downturn in tenants businesses may reduce our cash flows 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenues from continuing operations from rental income and tenant reimbursements 
a tenant may experience a downturn in its business  which may weaken its financial condition and result in its failure to make timely rental payments or result in defaults under our leases 
in the event of default by a tenant  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant also may adversely affect the income produced by our properties 
if any tenant becomes a debtor in a case under federal bankruptcy law  we cannot evict the tenant solely because of the bankruptcy 
in addition  the bankruptcy court might permit the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us 
our claim against the tenant for unpaid and future rent could be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease 
therefore  our claim for unpaid rent would likely not be paid in full 
any losses resulting from the bankruptcy of any of our existing tenants could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
a large percentage of our tenants operate in a concentrated group of industries and downturns in these industries could adversely affect our financial condition  revenues and results of operations 
as of december   as a percentage of our annualized base rental revenue  of our tenants operated in the technology and media industry  in the finance  insurance and real estate industry  in the professional  business and other services industry  and in the education and health services industry of which approximately are in the for profit education sector 
as we expand our acquisition and development activities in markets populated by high growth tenants in the technology and media industry  our tenant mix may become more concentrated  further exposing us to risks associated with that industry 
for a further discussion of the composition of our tenants by industry  see item properties significant tenants 
an economic downturn in any of these industries  or in any industry in which a significant number of our tenants currently or may in the future operate  could negatively impact the financial condition of such tenants and cause them to fail to make timely rental payments or default on lease obligations  fail to renew their leases or renew their leases on terms less favorable to us  become bankrupt or insolvent  or otherwise become unable to satisfy their obligations to us 
as a result  a downturn in an industry in which a significant number of our tenants operate could adversely affect our financial conditions and result of operations 
we may be unable to renew leases or re lease available space 
we had office space representing approximately  of the total square footage of our properties that was not occupied as of december  in addition  leases representing approximately and of the leased rentable square footage of our properties are scheduled to expire in and  respectively 
above market rental rates on some of our properties may force us to renew or re lease expiring leases at rates below current lease rates 
as of december   we believe that the weighted average cash rental rates for our overall portfolio  including recently acquired properties  are approximately at the current average quoted market rental rates  and weighted average cash rental rates for leases scheduled to expire during are approximately below the current average quoted market rental rates  although individual properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased at  above  or below the current market rental rates within that submarket 
we cannot provide any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be re leased at rental rates equal to or above the current rental rates 
if the average rental rates for our properties decrease or existing tenants do not renew their leases  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders could be adversely affected 
we are subject to governmental regulations that may affect the development  redevelopment  and use of our properties 
we are subject to governmental regulations that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
our properties are subject to regulation under federal laws  such as the americans with disabilities act of the ada pursuant to which all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons  and state and local laws addressing earthquake  fire  and life safety requirements 
although we believe that our properties substantially comply with requirements under applicable governmental regulations  none of our properties have been audited or investigated for compliance by any regulatory agency 
if we were not in compliance with material provisions of the ada or other regulations affecting our properties  we might be required to take remedial action  which could include making modifications or renovations to properties 
federal  state  or local governments may also enact future laws and regulations that could require us to make significant modifications or renovations to our properties 
if we were to incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or any other regulations  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders could be adversely affected 
our properties are subject to land use rules and regulations that govern our development  redevelopment  and use of our properties 
restrictions on our ability to develop  redevelop  or use our properties resulting from changes in the existing land use rules and regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  quoted trading price of our securities  our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
our debt level reduces cash available for distribution and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 
payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate our properties or to pay in cash the distributions necessary to maintain the company reit qualification 
our level of debt and the limitations imposed by our debt agreements may have substantial consequences to us  including the following we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity  or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness  cash flows may be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments  we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties  possibly on disadvantageous terms  we may default on our obligations  and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure the loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases  and our default under one mortgage loan could result in a default on other indebtedness with cross default provisions 
if one or more of these events were to occur  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders could be adversely affected 
in addition  foreclosures could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds  which could require us to borrow or sell assets to raise the funds necessary to meet the reit distribution requirements discussed below  even if such actions are not on favorable terms 
as of december   we had approximately billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness  million of which is contractually due prior to december  our total debt and preferred equity at december  represented of our total market capitalization which we define as the aggregate of our long term debt  liquidation value of our preferred equity  and the market value of the company common stock and the operating partnership common units of limited partnership interest  or common units 
in january  we repaid million of the total amount contractually due prior to december  in addition  on january   the operating partnership issued million of senior unsecured notes due and used the proceeds from the offering to repay the remaining outstanding balance on the operating partnership million unsecured revolving credit facility 
for calculation of our market capitalization and additional information on debt maturities see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources of the company capitalization and liquidity uses 
the covenants in the operating partnership revolving credit facility and term loan facility may limit our ability to make distributions to the holders of our common stock 
the operating partnership revolving credit facility and million unsecured term loan facility contain financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us on our common stock and preferred stock 
we rely on cash distributions we receive from the operating partnership to pay distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and to satisfy our other cash needs  and the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility provide that the operating partnership may not  in any year  make partnership distributions to us or other holders of its partnership interests in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of of the operating partnership consolidated funds from operations as similarly defined in each of the revolving credit facility and term loan facility agreements for such year  and an amount which results in distributions to us excluding any preferred partnership distributions to the extent the same have been deducted from consolidated funds from operations for such year in an amount sufficient to permit us to pay dividends to our stockholders that we reasonably believe are necessary to a maintain our qualification as a reit for federal and state income tax purposes and b avoid the payment of federal or state income or excise tax 
in addition  the revolving credit facility and term loan facility provide that  if the operating partnership fails to pay any principal of or interest on any borrowings under the revolving credit facility or term loan facility  respectively  when due  then the operating partnership may make only those partnership distributions to us and other holders of its partnership interests necessary to enable us to make distributions to our stockholders that we reasonably believe are necessary to maintain our status as a reit for federal and state income tax purposes 
any limitation on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders  whether as a result of these provisions in the revolving credit facility  the term loan facility or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and preferred stock 
a downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
the credit ratings assigned to the debt securities of the operating partnership and our preferred stock could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition 
these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies  and we cannot assure you that any rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if  in its judgment  circumstances warrant 
moreover  these credit ratings do not apply to our common stock and are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold any other securities 
if any of the credit rating agencies that have rated the debt securities of the operating partnership or our preferred stock downgrades or lowers its credit rating  or if any credit rating agency indicates that it has placed any such rating on a so called watch list for a possible downgrading or lowering or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative  it could have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of capital  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make dividends and distributions on our common stock and preferred stock 
we face significant competition  which may decrease the occupancy and rental rates of our properties 
we compete with several developers  owners  and operators of office and other commercial real estate  many of which own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located but which have lower occupancy rates than our properties 
therefore  our competitors have an incentive to decrease rental rates until their available space is leased 
as previously mentioned  as of december  we believe that the weighted average cash rental rates for our overall portfolio are approximately at the current average quoted market rental rates 
if our competitors offer space at rental rates below the rates currently charged by us for comparable space  we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those currently charged in order to retain tenants when our tenant leases expire 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders may be adversely affected 
in order to maintain the quality of our properties and successfully compete against other properties  we must periodically spend money to maintain  repair  and renovate our properties  which reduces our cash flows 
if our properties are not as attractive to current and prospective tenants in terms of rent  services  condition  or location as properties owned by our competitors  we could lose tenants or suffer lower rental rates 
as a result  we may from time to time be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain the competitiveness of our properties 
there can be no assurances that any such expenditure would result in higher occupancy or higher rental rates  or deter existing tenants from relocating to properties owned by our competitors 
potential casualty losses  such as earthquake losses  may not be covered by insurance and payment of such losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage  rental loss  and terrorism insurance covering all of our properties 
management believes the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate given the relative risk of loss  the cost of the coverage  and industry practice 
we do not carry insurance for generally uninsurable losses such as loss from riots or acts of god 
in addition  all of our properties are located in earthquake prone areas 
we carry earthquake insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles that management believes are commercially reasonable 
however  the amount of our earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes 
we may also discontinue earthquake insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for earthquake insurance exceeds the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss 
if we experience a loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits  we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties 
further  if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness  we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness  even if the properties were irreparable 
we are subject to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  and any costs to comply with  or liabilities arising under  such laws and regulations could be material 
as an owner  operator  manager  acquirer and developer of real properties  we are subject to environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
certain of these laws and regulations impose joint and several liability  without regard to fault  for investigation and clean up costs on current and former owners and operators of real property and persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment 
at some of the properties  there are asbestos containing materials  or tenants routinely handle hazardous substances as part of their operations 
in addition  historical operations  including the presence of underground storage tanks  have caused soil or groundwater contamination at or near some of the properties 
although we believe that the prior owners of the affected properties or other persons may have conducted remediation of known contamination at these properties  not all such contamination has been remediated 
unknown or unremediated contamination or the compliance with existing or new environmental or health and safety laws and regulations could require us to incur costs or liabilities that could be material 
see item business environmental regulations and potential liabilities 
we may be unable to complete acquisitions and successfully operate acquired properties 
we continually evaluate the market of available properties and may continue to acquire office properties and undeveloped land when strategic opportunities exist 
our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully operate them is subject to the following risks we may potentially be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other real estate investors with significant capital  including both publicly traded reits and institutional investment funds  the possibility that  even if we enter into agreements for the acquisition of office properties  we may be unable to complete such acquisitions because they remain subject to customary conditions to closing including the completion of due diligence investigations to management satisfaction  we may be unable to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or at all  we may spend more than budgeted amounts in operating costs or to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties  we may lease acquired properties at economic lease terms different than projected  we may acquire properties that are subject to liabilities for which we may have limited or no recourse  and we may be unable to complete an acquisition after making a nonrefundable deposit and incurring certain other acquisition related costs 
if we cannot finance property acquisitions on favorable terms or operate acquired properties to meet financial expectations  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders could be adversely affected 
we may be unable to successfully complete and operate acquired  developed  and redeveloped properties 
there are significant risks associated with property acquisition  development  and redevelopment including the possibility that we may be unable to lease acquired  developed  or redeveloped properties at projected economic lease terms or within budgeted timeframes  we may not complete development or redevelopment properties on schedule or within budgeted amounts  we may expend funds on and devote management time to acquisition  development  or redevelopment properties that we may not complete  we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning  land use  and other required entitlements  and building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations  we may encounter delays  refusals  unforeseen cost increases  and other impairments resulting from third party litigation  and we may fail to obtain the financial results expected from properties we acquire  develop  or redevelop 
if one or more of these events were to occur in connection with our acquired properties  undeveloped land  or development or redevelopment properties under construction  we could be required to recognize an impairment loss 
these events could also have an adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
while we historically have acquired  developed  and redeveloped office properties in california markets  over the past three years we have acquired ten properties in the state of washington and may in the future acquire  develop  or redevelop properties for other uses and expand our business to other geographic regions where we expect the development or acquisition of property to result in favorable risk adjusted returns on our investment 
presently  we do not possess the same level of familiarity with development of property types other than mixed use  office  or with certain outside markets  which could adversely affect our ability to acquire  develop or redevelop properties or to achieve expected performance 
we could default on leases for land on which some of our properties are located 
as of december   we owned eleven office buildings  located on various land parcels and regions  which we lease individually on a long term basis 
as of december   we had approximately million aggregate rentable square feet  or of our total stabilized portfolio  of rental space located on these leased parcels 
in addition  we had ground lease obligations for the land at one redevelopment property encompassing approximately  rentable square feet 
in  we exercised our option to purchase this land for a purchase price of million and we currently expect we will close the transaction in the second quarter of if we default under the terms of any particular lease  we may lose the ownership rights to the property subject to the lease 
upon expiration of a lease  we may not be able to renegotiate a new lease on favorable terms  if at all 
the loss of the ownership rights to these properties or an increase of rental expense could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
real estate assets are illiquid  and we may not be able to sell our properties when we desire 
our investments in our properties are relatively illiquid  limiting our ability to sell our properties quickly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
in addition  the code generally imposes a prohibited transaction tax on the company on profits derived from sales of properties held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  which effectively limits our ability to sell properties other than on a selected basis 
these restrictions on our ability to sell our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
we may invest in securities related to real estate  which could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
we may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and may  in the future  also invest in mortgages 
in general  investments in mortgages are subject to several risks  including borrowers may fail to make debt service payments or pay the principal when due  the value of the mortgaged property may be less than the principal amount of the mortgage note securing the property  and interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than our cost for the funds used to acquire these mortgages 
owning these securities may not entitle us to control the ownership  operation  and management of the underlying real estate 
in addition  we may have no control over the distributions with respect to these securities  which could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
future terrorist activity or engagement in war by the united states may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
terrorist attacks in the united states and other acts of terrorism or war  may result in declining economic activity  which could harm the demand for and the value of our properties 
in addition  the public perception that certain locations are at greater risk for attack  such as major airports  ports  and rail facilities  may decrease the demand for and the value of our properties near these sites 
a decrease in demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re lease our properties at these sites at lease rates equal to or above historical rates 
terrorist activities also could directly impact the value of our properties through damage  destruction  or loss  and the availability of insurance for these acts may be less  and cost more  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
to the extent that our tenants are impacted by future attacks  their businesses similarly could be adversely affected  including their ability to continue to honor their existing leases 
terrorist acts and engagement in war by the united states also may adversely affect the markets in which our securities trade and may cause further erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending and may result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies 
any one of these events may cause a decline in the demand for our office leased space  delay the time in which our new or renovated properties reach stabilized occupancy  increase our operating expenses  such as those attributable to increased physical security for our properties  and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital 
the enactment of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act will subject us to substantial additional federal regulation 
there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related requirements that have been  and will in the future be  imposed on publicly traded companies under the dodd frank act 
several of these provisions require the sec to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas 
for example  the dodd frank act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation and so called golden parachute payments  heightens certain independence standards for compensation advisers and authorizes the sec to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates for board seats using a registrant proxy materials 
our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  an increase in expenses and a diversion of management time from other business activities 
in addition  if stockholders do not vote to approve our executive compensation practices and or our equity plan amendments  these actions may interfere with our ability to attract and retain key personnel who are essential to our future success 
given the uncertainty associated with both the results of the existing dodd frank act requirements and the manner in which additional provisions of the dodd frank act will be implemented by various regulatory agencies and through regulations  the full extent of the impact that such requirements will have on our operations is unclear 
accordingly  the changes resulting from the dodd frank act may impact the profitability of business activities  require changes to certain business practices  or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  the quoted trading price of the company common stock and of the operating partnership publicly traded notes and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
our property taxes could increase due to reassessment or property tax rate changes 
we are required to pay some state and local taxes on our properties 
in addition  the real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change 
for example  under a current california law commonly referred to as proposition  property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a change in ownership of a property  as specially defined for purposes of those rules 
because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a change in ownership or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred  we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction 
therefore  the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past  including on a retroactive basis 
in addition  from time to time voters and lawmakers have announced initiatives to repeal or amend proposition to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial property and or introduce split tax roll legislation 
such initiatives  if successful  would increase the assessed value and or tax rates applicable to commercial property in california  including our office properties 
an increase in the assessed value of our properties or our property tax rates could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  the quoted trading price of the company common stock and of the operating partnership publicly traded notes and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
our business could be adversely impacted if there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 
the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors  misstatements or misrepresentations 
while management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time 
deficiencies  including any material weakness  in our internal control over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations  restatements of our financial statements  or otherwise adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  the quoted trading price of the company common stock and of the operating partnership publicly traded notes and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
we face risks associated with security breaches through cyber attacks  cyber intrusions or otherwise  as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology it networks and related systems 
we face risks associated with security breaches  whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions over the internet  malware  computer viruses  attachments to e mails  persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization  and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems 
the risk of a security breach or disruption  particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion  including by computer hackers  foreign governments and cyber terrorists  has generally increased as the number  intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased 
our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day to day operations including managing our building systems  and  in some cases  may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging 
a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  the quoted trading price of the company common stock and of the operating partnership publicly traded notes and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
risks related to our organizational structure loss of our key personnel could harm our operations and adversely affect the quoted trading price of our securities the leadership and performance of our executive and senior officers  particularly john b 
kilroy  jr  president and chief executive officer  jeffrey c 
hawken  executive vice president and chief operating officer  eli khouri  executive vice president and chief investment officer  tyler h 
rose  executive vice president and chief financial officer  and justin w 
smart  executive vice president  development and construction services  play a key role in the success of the company 
they are integral to the company success for many reasons  including that each has a strong national or regional reputation in our industry and investment community 
in addition  they have significant relationships with investors  lenders  tenants and industry personnel  which benefit the company 
our future performance will be substantially dependent on our ability to retain and motivate these individuals 
the loss or limited availability of the services of our key personnel could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition and could be negatively perceived in the capital markets 
our growth depends on external sources of capital that are outside of our control and the inability to obtain capital on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all  could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the company is required under the code to distribute at least of its taxable income subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain  and the operating partnership is required to make distributions to the company to allow the company to satisfy these reit distribution requirements 
because of these distribution requirements  the operating partnership is required to make distributions to the company  and we may not be able to fund future capital needs  including any necessary acquisition financing  from operating cash flow 
consequently  management relies on third party sources of capital to fund our capital needs 
we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage 
access to third party sources of capital depends  in part  on general market conditions and the availability of credit  the market perception of our growth potential  our current and expected future earnings  our cash flows and cash distributions  and the quoted trading price of our securities 
if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  the quoted trading price of our securities  and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders may be adversely affected 
our common limited partners have limited approval rights  which may prevent us from completing a change of control transaction that may be in the best interests of all our security holders 
the company may not withdraw as the operating partnership general partner or transfer its general partnership interest in the operating partnership without the approval of the holders of at least of the units representing common limited partnership interests  including the common units held by the company in its capacity as the operating partnership general partner 
in addition  the company may not engage in a merger  consolidation  or other combination or the sale of substantially all of its assets or such similar transaction  without the approval of the holders of of the common units  including the common units held by the company in its capacity as the operating partnership general partner 
the right of our common limited partners to vote on these transactions could limit our ability to complete a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interest of all our security holders 
in certain circumstances  our limited partners must approve our dissolution and the disposition of properties contributed by the limited partners 
for as long as limited partners own at least of all of the operating partnership partnership interests  we must obtain the approval of limited partners holding a majority of the units representing common limited partnership interests before we may dissolve 
as of december   limited partners owned approximately of the operating partnership partnership interests  of which was owned by john b 
kilroy  sr 
and john b 
kilroy  jr 
in addition  we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the tax consequences to common limited partners resulting from the repayment  refinancing  replacement  or restructuring of debt  or any sale  exchange  or other disposition of any of our other assets 
the exercise of one or more of these approval rights by the limited partners could delay or prevent us from completing a transaction that may be in the best interest of all our security holders 
the chairman of our board of directors and our president and chief executive officer each have substantial influence over our affairs 
john b 
kilroy  sr 
is the chairman of our board of directors and the father of john b 
kilroy  jr  our president and chief executive officer 
each is a member of our board of directors  and together  as of december   they beneficially owned approximately of the total outstanding shares of the company common stock 
the percentage of outstanding shares of common stock beneficially owned includes  shares of common stock   restricted stock units that were vested and held by john b 
kilroy  jr 
at december   and assumes the exchange into shares of the company common stock of the  common units of the operating partnership held by messrs 
kilroy which are redeemable in exchange for  at the option of the company  an equal number of shares of the company common stock 
pursuant to the company charter  no stockholder may own  actually or constructively  more than by value or by number of shares  whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding company common stock without obtaining a waiver from the board of directors 
the board of directors has waived the ownership limits with respect to john b 
kilroy  sr  john b 
kilroy  jr  members of their families  and some of their affiliated entities 
these named individuals and entities may own either actually or constructively  in the aggregate  up to of the company outstanding common stock  excluding operating partnership units that are exchangeable into shares of company common stock 
consequently  messrs 
kilroy have substantial influence on the company  and because the company is the manager of the operating partnership  on the operating partnership  and could exercise their influence in a manner that is not in the best interest of our stockholders  noteholders or unitholders 
also  they may  in the future  have a substantial influence on the outcome of any matters submitted to our stockholders or unitholders for approval 
there are restrictions on the ownership of the company capital stock that limit the opportunities for a change of control at a premium to existing security holders 
provisions of the maryland general corporation law  the company charter and bylaws  and the operating partnership partnership agreement may delay  deter  or prevent a change of control of the company  or the removal of existing management 
any of these actions might prevent our security holders from receiving a premium for their common shares or common units over the then prevailing market price of the shares of the company common stock 
in order for the company to qualify as a reit under the code its stock must be beneficially owned by or more persons during at least days of a taxable year of months other than the first year for which an election to be a reit has been made or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year 
also  not more than of the value of the outstanding shares of the company stock may be owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities during the last half of a taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be a reit has been made 
the company charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of its capital stock that are intended to assist the company in complying with these requirements and continuing to qualify as a reit 
no single stockholder may own  either actually or constructively  absent a waiver from the board of directors  more than by value or by number of shares  whichever is more restrictive of the company outstanding common stock 
similarly  absent a waiver from the board of directors  no single holder of the company series g cumulative redeemable preferred stock the series g preferred stock may actually or constructively own more than by value or by number of shares  whichever is more restrictive of the company series g preferred stock  and no single holder of the company series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock the series h preferred stock may actually or constructively own more than by value or by number of shares  whichever is more restrictive of the company series h preferred stock 
the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals and or entities to be owned constructively by one individual or entity 
as a result  the acquisition of less than the applicable ownership limit of a particular class of the company capital stock could  nevertheless  cause that individual or entity  or another individual or entity  to constructively own stock in excess of  and thereby subject such stock to  the applicable ownership limit 
the board of directors may waive the ownership limits if it is satisfied that the excess ownership would not jeopardize the company reit status and if it believes that the waiver would be in our best interest 
the board of directors has waived the ownership limits with respect to john b 
kilroy  sr  john b 
kilroy  jr  members of their families  and some of their affiliated entities 
these named individuals and entities may own either actually or constructively  in the aggregate  up to of the company outstanding common stock  excluding common units that are exchangeable into shares of common stock 
the board of directors has also waived the ownership limits with respect to the initial purchasers of the exchangeable senior notes due the exchangeable notes and certain of their affiliated entities to beneficially own up to  in the aggregate  of the company common stock in connection with hedging the capped call transactions 
if anyone acquires shares in excess of any ownership limits  the transfer to the transferee will be void with respect to the excess shares  the excess shares will be automatically transferred to a trust for the benefit of a qualified charitable organization  and the purported transferee or owner will have no rights with respect to those excess shares 
the company charter contains provisions that may delay  deter  or prevent a change of control transaction 
the following provisions of the company charter may delay or prevent a change of control over us  even if a change of control might be beneficial to our security holders  deter tender offers that may be beneficial to our security holders  or limit security holders opportunity to receive a potential premium for their shares and or units if an investor attempted to gain shares beyond the company ownership limits or otherwise to effect a change of control the company charter authorizes the board of directors to issue up to  shares of the company preferred stock  including convertible preferred stock  without stockholder approval 
the board of directors may establish the preferences  rights  and other terms  including the right to vote and the right to convert into common stock any shares issued 
the issuance of preferred stock could delay or prevent a tender offer or a change of control even if a tender offer or a change of control was in our security holder interest 
as of december    shares of the company preferred stock were issued and outstanding  consisting of  shares of the company series g preferred stock and  shares of the company series h preferred stock  and the company charter states that any director  or the entire board of directors  may be removed from office at any time  but only for cause and then only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two thirds of the votes of the company capital stock entitled to be cast in the election of directors 
the board of directors may change investment and financing policies without unitholder or stockholder approval  causing us to become more highly leveraged  which may increase our risk of default under our debt obligations 
we are not limited in our ability to incur debt 
our financing policies and objectives are determined by the board of directors 
our goal is to limit our dependence on leverage and maintain a conservative ratio of debt to total market capitalization 
however  our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness  funded or otherwise  that we may incur 
as of december   we had approximately billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding  which represented of our total market capitalization 
our total debt and the liquidation value of our preferred equity as a percentage of total market capitalization was approximately as of december  in addition  on january   the operating partnership issued million of senior unsecured notes due see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources of the company capitalization for a calculation of our market capitalization 
these ratios may be increased or decreased without the consent of our unitholders or stockholders 
increases in the amount of debt outstanding would result in an increase in our debt service  which could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to pay dividends and distributions to our security holders 
higher leverage also increases the risk of default on our obligations and limits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future 
we may issue additional common units and shares of capital stock without unitholder or stockholder approval  as applicable  which may dilute unitholder or stockholder investment 
the company may issue shares of our common stock  preferred stock  or other equity or debt securities without stockholder approval  including the issuance of shares to satisfy reit dividend distribution requirements 
similarly  the operating partnership may offer its common or preferred units for contributions of cash or property without approval by its unitholders 
further  under certain circumstances  the company may issue shares of our common stock in exchange for the operating partnership outstanding exchangeable notes 
existing security holders have no preemptive rights to acquire any of these securities  and any issuance of equity securities under these circumstances may dilute a unitholder or stockholder investment 
sales of a substantial number of shares of the company securities  or the perception that this could occur  could result in decreasing the quoted trading price per share of the company common stock and of the operating partnership publicly traded notes 
management cannot predict whether future issuances of shares of the company common stock or the availability of shares for resale in the open market will result in decreasing the market price per share of the company common stock 
as of december    shares of the company common stock and  shares of the company preferred stock  consisting of  shares of series g preferred stock and  shares of series h preferred stock  were issued and outstanding 
as of december   the company had reserved for future issuance the following shares of common stock  shares issuable upon the exchange  at the company option  of the operating partnership common units   shares remained available for grant under our incentive award plan see note to our consolidated financial statements   shares issuable upon settlement of rsus  and  shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options  as well as  shares potentially issuable under certain circumstances  in exchange for the exchangeable notes 
the company has a currently effective registration statement registering  shares of our common stock for possible issuance to the holders of the operating partnership common units 
that registration statement also registers  shares of common stock held by certain stockholders for possible resale 
the company also has a currently effective registration statement registering the  shares of our common stock that may potentially be issued in exchange for the operating partnership presently outstanding exchangeable notes 
consequently  if and when the shares are issued  they may be freely traded in the public markets 
risks related to taxes and the company status as a reit loss of the company reit status would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of the company common stock 
the company currently operates in a manner that is intended to allow it to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code 
if the company were to lose its reit status  the company would face adverse tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to its stockholders for each of the years involved because the company would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing the company taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  the company could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes  and unless entitled to relief under statutory provisions  the company could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which the company was disqualified 
in addition  if the company failed to qualify as a reit  it would not be required to make distributions to its stockholders 
as a result of all these factors  the company failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value and quoted trading price of the company common stock 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations 
the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code is greater in the case of a reit that  like the company  holds its assets through a partnership 
the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect the company ability to continue to qualify as a reit 
for example  to qualify as a reit  at least of the company gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources 
also  the company must make distributions to its stockholders aggregating annually at least of the company net taxable income excluding any net capital gains 
in addition  legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations  or court decisions may adversely affect the company security holders or the company ability to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 
although management believes that we are organized and operate in a manner to permit the company to continue to qualify as a reit  we cannot provide assurances that the company has qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes 
we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs regarding the company qualification as a reit 
to maintain the company reit status  we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions 
to qualify as a reit  the company generally must distribute to its stockholders at least of the company net taxable income each year excluding any net capital gains  and the company will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that it distributes less than of its net taxable income each year 
in addition  the company will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which distributions it pays in any calendar year are less than the sum of of its ordinary income  of its net capital gains  and of its undistributed income from prior years 
to maintain the company reit status and avoid the payment of federal income and excise taxes  the operating partnership may need to borrow funds and distribute or loan the proceeds to the company so it can meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings 
these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes  or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures  the creation of reserves  or required debt or amortization payments 
if a transaction intended to qualify as a section exchange is later determined to be taxable  we may face adverse consequences 
from time to time we dispose of properties in transactions that are intended to qualify as section exchanges 
if the qualification of a transaction as a section exchange is successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable  we generally would be required to pay taxes on any gain recognized upon the disposition of the property  including any interest and penalties  for the particular year in question  to the extent such amounts were not otherwise distributed to our stockholders 
in such case  we would have less cash available to distribute to our stockholders and may be required to borrow funds in unfavorable conditions in order to pay such amounts 
in addition  we may be required to amend our tax returns for the applicable year in question  including any information reports we sent to our stockholders 
dividends payable by reits  including us  generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 
qualified dividends payable to us stockholders that are individuals  trusts and estates generally are subject to tax at preferential rates 
subject to limited exceptions  dividends payable by reits are not eligible for these reduced rates and are taxable at ordinary income tax rates 
the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals  trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non reit corporations that pay dividends  which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits  including the shares of our capital stock 
the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes 
a reit net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a penalty tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property  other than foreclosure property  held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business  unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors  such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors 
complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of our income  the nature and diversification of our assets  the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our capital stock 
if we fail to comply with one or more of the asset tests at the end of any calendar quarter  we must correct the failure within days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences 
in order to meet these tests  we may be required to forego investments we might otherwise make or to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 
thus  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our performance and reduce amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 
legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect us 
in recent years  numerous legislative  judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in reits and similar entities 
additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future  and any such changes may impact our ability to qualify as a reit  our tax treatment as a reit or the tax treatment of our stockholders

includes the noncontrolling interest of the common units of the operating partnership 
the company calculates ffo in accordance with the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit 
the white paper defines ffo as net income or loss calculated in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items  as defined by gaap  gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate and impairment write downs associated with depreciable real estate  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management believes that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of the company operating performance 
the exclusion from ffo of gains and losses from the sale of operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of the company activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
also  because ffo is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of reits  it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other reits 
however  other reits may use different methodologies to calculate ffo  and accordingly  the company ffo may not be comparable to all other reits 
implicit in historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap is the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  management believes that ffo along with the required gaap presentations provides a more complete measurement of the company performance relative to its competitors and a more appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating  financing  and investing activities than the required gaap presentations alone would provide 
however  ffo should not be viewed as an alternative measure of the company operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company properties  which are significant economic costs and could materially impact the company results from operations 
noncash adjustments to arrive at ffo were as follows noncontrolling interest in earnings of the operating partnership  depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and net gain loss from dispositions of operating properties 
for additional information  see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non gaap supplemental financial measure funds from operations including a reconciliation of the company gaap net income available for common stockholders to ffo for the periods presented

this discussion of our critical accounting policies is intended to supplement the description of our accounting policies in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements and to provide additional insight into the information used by management when evaluating significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
rental revenue recognition rental revenue is our principal source of revenue 
the timing of when we commence rental revenue recognition depends largely on our conclusion as to whether we are or the tenant is the owner for accounting purposes of the tenant improvements at the leased property 
when we conclude that we are the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes  we record the cost to construct the tenant improvements as an asset  and we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of or controls the finished space  which is typically when such tenant improvements are substantially complete 
the determination of whether we are or the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements for accounting purposes is subject to significant judgment 
in making that determination  we consider numerous factors and perform a detailed evaluation of each individual lease 
no one factor is determinative in reaching a conclusion 
the factors we evaluate include but are not limited to the following whether the lease agreement requires landlord approval of how the tenant improvement allowance is spent prior to installation of the tenant improvements  whether the lease agreement requires the tenant to provide evidence to the landlord supporting the cost and what the tenant improvement allowance was spent on prior to payment by the landlord for such tenant improvements  whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or reusable by other tenants  whether the tenant is permitted to alter or remove the tenant improvements without the consent of the landlord or without compensating the landlord for any lost utility or diminution in fair value  and whether the ownership of the tenant improvements remains with the landlord or remains with the tenant at the end of the lease term 
in addition  we also record the cost of certain tenant improvements paid for or reimbursed by tenants when we conclude that we are the owner of such tenant improvements using the factors discussed above 
for these tenant funded tenant improvements  we record the amount funded or reimbursed by tenants as deferred revenue  which is amortized and recognized as rental revenue over the term of the related lease beginning upon substantial completion of the leased premises 
during the years ended december    and  we capitalized million  million  and million  respectively  of tenant funded tenant improvements 
leases at our development and redevelopment properties generally have higher tenant funded tenant improvements and we expect the trend to continue to increase as our development and redevelopment activities increase 
for those periods  we also recognized million  million  and million  respectively  of noncash rental revenue related to the amortization of deferred revenue recorded in connection with tenant funded tenant improvements 
when we conclude that we are not the owner and the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes  we record our contribution towards those improvements as a lease incentive  which is amortized as a reduction to rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease  and rental revenue recognition begins when the tenant takes possession of or controls the space 
our determination as to whether we are or the tenant is the owner of tenant improvements for accounting purposes is made on a lease by lease basis and has a significant impact on the amount of noncash rental revenue that we record related to the amortization of deferred revenue for tenant funded tenant improvements  and can also have a significant effect on the timing of our overall revenue recognition 
tenant reimbursement revenue reimbursements from tenants consist of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate taxes  and other recoverable costs  including capital expenditures 
calculating tenant reimbursement revenue requires an in depth analysis of the complex terms of each underlying lease 
examples of judgments and estimates used when determining the amounts recoverable include estimating the final expenses  net of accruals  that are recoverable  estimating the fixed and variable components of operating expenses for each building  conforming recoverable expense pools to those used in establishing the base year or base allowance for the applicable underlying lease  and concluding whether an expense or capital expenditure is recoverable pursuant to the terms of the underlying lease 
during the year  we accrue estimated tenant reimbursement revenue in the period in which the tenant reimbursable costs are incurred based on our best estimate of the amounts to be recovered 
throughout the year  we perform analyses to properly match tenant reimbursement revenue with reimbursable costs incurred to date 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of each year  we perform preliminary reconciliations and accrue additional tenant reimbursement revenue or refunds 
subsequent to year end  we perform final detailed reconciliations and analyses on a lease by lease basis and bill or refund each tenant for any cumulative annual adjustments in the first and second quarters of each year for the previous year s activity 
our historical experience for the years ended december    and has been that our final reconciliation and billing process resulted in final amounts that approximated the total annual tenant reimbursement revenues recognized 
allowances for uncollectible current tenant receivables and deferred rent receivables tenant receivables and deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for uncollectible current tenant receivables and deferred rent receivables 
current tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments and reimbursements of common area maintenance expenses  property taxes  and other costs recoverable from tenants 
deferred rent receivables represent the amount by which the cumulative straight line rental revenue recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the lease agreement 
as of december  and  current receivables were carried net of an allowance for uncollectible amount of million for each period and deferred rent receivables were carried net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts of million and million  respectively 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible current tenant receivables and the allowance for deferred rent receivables is performed using a methodology that incorporates a specific identification analysis and an aging analysis and includes an overall evaluation of our historical loss trends and the current economic and business environment 
this determination requires significant judgment and estimates about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimates are made  including the creditworthiness of specific tenants  specific industry trends and conditions  and general economic trends and conditions 
since these factors are beyond our control  actual results can differ from our estimates  and such differences could be material 
with respect to the allowance for uncollectible tenant receivables  the specific identification methodology analysis relies on factors such as the age and nature of the receivables  the payment history and financial condition of the tenant  our assessment of the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations  and the status of negotiations of any disputes with the tenant 
with respect to the allowance for deferred rent receivables  given the longer term nature of these receivables  the specific identification methodology analysis evaluates each of our significant tenants and any tenants on our internal watchlist and relies on factors such as each tenant s financial condition and its ability to meet its lease obligations 
we evaluate our reserve levels quarterly based on changes in the financial condition of tenants and our assessment of the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations  overall economic conditions  and the current business environment 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded a total provision for bad debts for both current tenant receivables and deferred rent receivables of approximately   and  respectively  of rental revenue 
the negative provision for the year ended december  reflects the reversal of approximately million of a provision for bad debts recorded in prior years against outstanding receivables from a former tenant due to the settlement of outstanding litigation with the former tenant in excluding the million reversal of the provision in  our historical experience has been that actual write offs of current tenant receivables and deferred rent receivables has approximated the provision for bad debts recorded for the years ended december    and in the event our estimates were not accurate and we had to change our allowances by of recurring revenue  the potential impact to our net income available to common stockholders would be approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
acquisitions we record the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of acquisitions of all operating properties and those development and redevelopment opportunities that meet the accounting criteria to be accounted for as business combinations at fair value at the acquisition date 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize available market information and discount and or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the acquired assets and assumed liabilities for an operating property acquisition generally include but are not limited to land  buildings and improvements  construction in progress and identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities associated with in place leases  including tenant improvements  leasing costs  value of above market and below market operating leases and ground leases  acquired in place lease values and tenant relationships  if any 
the fair value of land is derived from comparable sales of land within the same submarket and or region 
the fair value of buildings and improvements  tenant improvements  and leasing costs are based upon current market replacement costs and other relevant market rate information 
the fair value of the above market or below market component of an acquired in place operating lease is based upon the present value calculated using a market discount rate of the difference between i the contractual rents to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining non cancellable lease term and ii management estimate of the rents that would be paid using fair market rental rates and rent escalations at the date of acquisition measured over the remaining non cancellable term of the lease for above market operating leases and the initial non cancellable term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options  if applicable  for below market operating leases 
the amounts recorded for above market operating leases are included in deferred leasing costs and acquisition related intangibles  net on the balance sheet and are amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction of rental income over the remaining term of the applicable leases 
the amounts recorded for below market operating leases are included in deferred revenue and acquisition related liabilities  net on the balance sheet and are amortized on a straight line basis as an increase to rental income over the remaining term of the applicable leases plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options  if applicable 
our below market operating leases generally do not include fixed rate or below market renewal options 
the fair value of acquired in place leases is derived based on management assessment of lost revenue and costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased 
this fair value is based on a variety of considerations including  but not necessarily limited to the value associated with avoiding the cost of originating the acquired in place leases  the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs estimated to be incurred during the assumed lease up period  and the value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during the assumed lease up period 
factors considered by us in performing these analyses include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses  and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand at market rates 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
the amount recorded for acquired in place leases is included in deferred leasing costs and acquisition related intangibles  net on the balance sheet and amortized as an increase to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining term of the applicable leases 
if a lease were to be terminated or if termination were determined to be likely prior to its contractual expiration for example resulting from bankruptcy  amortization of the related unamortized in place lease intangible would be accelerated 
the determination of the fair value of any debt assumed in connection with a property acquisition is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
the determination of the fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities of operating property acquisitions requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about the numerous inputs discussed above 
the use of different assumptions in these fair value calculations could significantly affect the reported amounts of the allocation of our acquisition related assets and liabilities and the related amortization and depreciation expense recorded for such assets and liabilities 
in addition  because the value of above and below market leases are amortized as either a reduction or increase to rental income  respectively  our judgments for these intangibles could have a significant impact on our reported rental revenues and results of operations 
costs directly associated with all operating property acquisitions and those development and redevelopment acquisitions that meet the accounting criteria to be accounted for as business combinations are expensed as incurred 
during the years ended december    and  we expensed million  million and million of acquisition costs respectively  based on the level of our acquisition activity during those years 
our acquisition expenses are directly related to our acquisition activity and if our acquisition activity was to increase or decrease  so would our acquisition costs 
costs directly associated with development acquisitions accounted for as asset acquisitions are capitalized as part of the cost of the acquisition 
during the year ended december   we capitalized million of such acquisition costs 
we did not capitalize any acquisition costs during the years ended december  and evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate our real estate assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a given asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate our real estate assets for impairment on a property by property basis 
indicators we use to determine whether an impairment evaluation is necessary include low occupancy levels or forecasted low occupancy levels at a specific property  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a historical pattern or future projection of potential continued operating or cash flow losses at a specific property  deterioration in rental rates for a specific property as evidenced by sudden significant rental rate decreases or continuous rental rate decreases over numerous quarters  which could signal a continued decrease in future cash flow for that property  deterioration of a given rental submarket as evidenced by significant increases in market vacancy and or negative absorption rates or continuous increases in market vacancy and or negative absorption rates over numerous quarters  which could signal a decrease in future cash flow for properties within that submarket  significant increases in property sales yields  continuous increases in property sales yields over several quarters  or recent property sales at a loss within a given submarket  each of which could signal a decrease in the market value of properties  significant change in strategy or use of a specific property or any other event that could result in a decreased holding period  including classifying a property as held for sale  or significant development delay  evidence of material physical damage to the property  and default by a significant tenant when any of the other indicators above are present 
when we evaluate for potential impairment our real estate assets to be held and used  we first evaluate whether there are any indicators of impairment 
if any impairment indicators are present for a specific real estate asset  we then perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis and compare the net carrying amount of the real estate asset to the real estate asset s estimated undiscounted future cash flow over the anticipated holding period 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flow is less than the net carrying amount of the real estate asset  we perform an impairment loss calculation to determine if the fair value of the real estate asset is less than the net carrying value of the real estate asset 
our impairment loss calculation compares the net carrying amount of the real estate asset to the real estate asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated discounted future cash flow calculations or third party valuations or appraisals 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s net carrying amount exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the estimated fair value of the asset becomes its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset 
our undiscounted cash flow and fair value calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flow and property fair values  including selecting the discount or capitalization rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flow 
estimating projected cash flow is highly subjective as it requires assumptions related to future rental rates  tenant allowances  operating expenditures  property taxes  capital improvements  and occupancy levels 
we are also required to make a number of assumptions relating to future economic and market events and prospective operating trends 
determining the appropriate capitalization rate also requires significant judgment and is typically based on many factors including the prevailing rate for the market or submarket  as well as the quality and location of the properties 
further  capitalization rates can fluctuate resulting from a variety of factors in the overall economy or within regional markets 
if the actual net cash flow or actual market capitalization rates significantly differ from our estimates  the impairment evaluation for an individual asset could be materially affected 
because of the economic and market environment  circumstances indicated that an analysis for potential impairment of certain of our properties was necessary in each of the years ended december    and as a result  for each property where such an indicator occurred and or for properties within a given submarket where such an indicator occurred  we completed an impairment evaluation 
after completing this process  we determined that for each of the operating properties evaluated  undiscounted cash flows over the holding period were in excess of carrying value and  therefore  we did not record any impairment losses for these periods 
we determined that for each of the properties held for sale  that the sale price less estimated costs to sell exceeded the carrying value and therefore we did not record any impairment losses for these properties 
cost capitalization and depreciation we capitalize costs associated with development and redevelopment activities  capital improvements  tenant improvements  and leasing activities 
for the years ended december    and we capitalized million  million  and million respectively  of internal costs to our qualifying redevelopment and development projects 
amounts capitalized are depreciated or amortized over estimated useful lives determined by management 
we depreciate buildings and improvements based on the estimated useful life of the asset  and we amortize tenant improvements and leasing costs over the shorter of the estimated useful life or estimated remaining life of the related lease 
all capitalized costs are depreciated or amortized using the straight line method 
determining whether expenditures meet the criteria for capitalization and the assignment of depreciable lives requires management to exercise significant judgment 
expenditures that meet one or more of the following criteria generally qualify for capitalization provide benefit in future periods  extend the useful life of the asset beyond our original estimates  and increase the quality of the asset beyond our original estimates 
our historical experience has demonstrated that we have not had material write offs of assets and that our depreciation and amortization estimates have been reasonable and appropriate 
share based incentive compensation accounting at december   the company had one share based incentive compensation plan  the kilroy realty incentive award plan  which is described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the executive compensation committee determines compensation for our chief executive officer  chief operating officer  chief investment officer and chief financial officer the executive officers 
compensation cost for all share based awards  including options  requires measurement at estimated fair value on the grant date and compensation cost is recognized over the service vesting period  which represents the requisite service period 
the grant date fair value for compensation plans that contain market measures are performed using complex pricing valuation models that require the input of assumptions  including judgments to estimate expected stock price volatility  expected life  and forfeiture rate 
specifically  the grant date fair value of market measure based share based compensation plans are calculated using a monte carlo simulation pricing model and the grant date fair value of stock option grants are calculated using the black scholes valuation model 
for the year ended december  we recorded approximately million of compensation expense related to plans that contained market measures and were therefore subject to such valuation models 
if the valuation of the grant date fair value for such plans changed by  the potential impact to our net income available to common stockholders would be approximately million for the year ended december  there was no compensation expense related to market measure based plans recorded for the years ended december  and since our market measure based share based compensation plans and options were granted in factors that may influence future results of operations acquisitions 
during the year ended december   we acquired office buildings in seven transactions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million and six development and redevelopment opportunity projects in six transactions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we acquired ten office buildings and one redevelopment opportunity project in eight transactions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information 
as of the date of this report  we have completed the acquisition of one additional office building with a purchase price of approximately million 
we generally finance our acquisitions through proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities  borrowings under our revolving revolving credit facility  proceeds from our capital recycling program and the assumption of existing debt 
as a key component of our growth strategy  we continually evaluate acquisition opportunities including office properties  undeveloped land  and development and redevelopment opportunities as they arise 
as a result  at any point in time we may have one or more potential acquisitions under consideration that are in varying stages of evaluation  negotiation or due diligence review  which may include potential acquisitions under contract 
as of the date of the filing of this report  we were also in negotiations to acquire an additional future development opportunity 
we cannot provide assurance that we will acquire this property 
in the future  we may enter into agreements to acquire other properties  either as wholly owned properties or through joint ventures  and those agreements typically will be subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions 
we cannot provide assurance that we will enter into any agreements to acquire properties  or that the potential acquisitions contemplated by any agreements we may enter into in the future will be completed 
costs associated with acquisitions accounted for as business combinations are expensed as incurred  and we may be unable to complete an acquisition after making a nonrefundable deposit or incurring acquisition related costs 
in addition  acquisitions are subject to various other risks and uncertainties 
capital recycling program 
during the year ended december   we disposed of seven office properties and our entire industrial portfolio  which was comprised of industrial properties  with a combined  rentable square feet  for a total gross sales price of approximately million at a net gain of million see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information 
in connection with this transaction  the dispositions were structured to qualify as section exchanges 
approximately million of the sales proceeds  which were included in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets at december   were reinvested into qualifying replacement properties as of the filing date of this report 
as part of our current and ongoing strategy  we continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties and undeveloped land in our portfolio with the intent of recycling the proceeds generated from the disposition of non strategic properties into capital to fund new operating and development acquisitions  development and redevelopment expenditures  to repay long term debt and for other general corporate purposes 
as part of our capital recycling strategy  we intend  when practical  to enter into section exchanges to defer some or all of the taxable gains  if any  on the sales for federal and state income tax purposes 
the timing of any potential future deposition transactions will depend on market conditions and other factors  including but not limited to our capital needs and our ability to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales 
we cannot assure you that we will dispose of any additional properties  or that future acquisitions and or dispositions  if any  will qualify as section exchanges 
leasing activity and changes in rental rates 
the amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space  newly developed or redeveloped properties  newly acquired properties with vacant space  and space available from unscheduled lease terminations 
the amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in our submarkets 
negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods

calculated as the percentage of space either renewed or expanded into by existing tenants or subtenants at lease expiration 
during the year  leases totaling approximately  rentable square feet were signed but had not commenced as of december  as of december   we believe that the weighted average cash rental rates for our stabilized portfolio  including recently acquired operating properties  are approximately at the current average market rental rates  although individual properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased either above  below  or at the current market rates within that submarket  and the average rental rates for individual submarkets may be above  below  or at the average cash rental rate of our portfolio 
in general  market rental rates increased in the majority of our submarkets during our rental rates and occupancy are impacted by general economic conditions  including the pace of regional economic growth and access to capital 
therefore  we cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be re leased at rental rates equal to or above the current market rates 
additionally  decreased demand and other negative trends or unforeseeable events that impair our ability to timely renew or re lease space could have further negative effects on our future financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows

the leases scheduled to expire in and represent approximately million rentable square feet of office space  or of our total annualized base rental revenue 
we believe that the weighted average cash rental rates are approximately under the current average quoted market rates for leases scheduled to expire during and  although individual properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased either above  below  or at the current quoted market rates within that submarket  and the average rental rates for individual submarkets may be above  below  or at the average cash rental rate of our overall portfolio 
our ability to re lease available space depends upon both general market conditions and the market conditions in the specific regions in which individual properties are located 
redevelopment projects we believe that a portion of our potential long term future growth will continue to come from redevelopment opportunities both through acquired properties and within our existing portfolio 
redevelopment opportunities are those projects in which we spend significant development and construction costs on existing or acquired buildings pursuant to a formal plan  the intended result of which is a higher economic return on the property 
during the fourth quarter ended december   we completed construction of the following two redevelopment projects 
e 
imperial highway  el segundo  submarket of los angeles  on which we commenced redevelopment in the third quarter of the redevelopment project  encompassing approximately  rentable square feet  has a total estimated investment of approximately million  including the million net carrying value of the project at the commencement of redevelopment 
the building was pre leased to directv  our largest tenant 
directv began paying cash rent on the entire building in december wateridge vista drive  sorrento mesa  submarket of san diego  on which we commenced redevelopment in the third quarter of the redevelopment project encompasses approximately  rentable square feet 
as part of the redevelopment  we incorporated one of our undeveloped land parcels 
the redevelopment project has a total estimated investment of approximately million  including the million net carrying value of the project at the commencement of redevelopment 
the building was pre leased to td ameritrade and rent commenced in october as of december   we had one redevelopment project in lease up and another redevelopment project under construction 
airport way  long beach  submarket of los angeles  on which we commenced redevelopment in the third quarter of this lease up property  encompassing approximately  rentable square feet  was leased prior to the commencement of redevelopment which was done in two phases 
redevelopment on the first half  which was leased  was completed during the second quarter of  and redevelopment on the second half was completed in the fourth quarter of the lease up project will have a total estimated investment of approximately million upon completion  including the million net carrying value of the project at the commencement of redevelopment 
third street  south of market area  submarket of san francisco  on which we commenced redevelopment in the fourth quarter of the redevelopment project  which encompasses approximately  rentable square feet  will have a total estimated investment of approximately million at completion  including the million net carrying value of the project at the commencement of redevelopment plus million that we expect to pay in the second quarter of to acquire the land that is currently subject to a ground lease 
construction is currently expected to be completed in the first quarter of as of december   the building was approximately leased and occupied 
in process and future development pipeline we believe that a portion of our long term future growth will also come from the completion of our under construction and in process projects as well as executing on our future development pipeline  subject to market conditions 
during  we increased our focus on value add and highly accretive development opportunities and expanded our future development pipeline through targeted acquisitions of development opportunities on the west coast 
we have a proactive planning process by which we continually evaluate the size  timing  costs and scope of our development program and  as necessary  scale activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist in our strategic submarkets 
we expect to proceed in our development program with discipline and will be pursuing opportunities with attractive economic returns  in locations with transportation and retail amenities and in markets with strong fundamentals and visible demand 
we plan to develop in phases as appropriate and we strongly favor starting projects that are pre leased 
as of the date of this report  our near term development pipeline consisted of the following four projects under construction and two projects expected to commence in e 
middlefield road  mountain view  california  which we acquired in may we acquired the project for million  comprised of a cash purchase price of million plus million of assumed leasing commissions and other net accrued liabilities 
the development project  which is pre leased to synopsis  inc  has a total estimated investment of approximately million and is expected to encompass approximately  rentable square feet upon completion 
construction is currently in process and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fairchild drive  mountain view  california  which we acquired in december and is pre leased 
we acquired the project for million plus million of development costs to be reimbursed to the seller and are planning to develop an approximately  square foot building 
the development project has a total estimated investment of approximately million 
construction is currently in process and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of mission street  south of market financial district  san francisco  california  which we acquired in october for approximately million 
shortly after acquisition  we pre leased the entire project to salesforce 
com and are currently planning to develop an approximately  square foot  story office tower that adapts our open plan workspace concepts to a high rise office environment 
the property is expected to be leed platinum certified and the first ground up development property in the city to receive this designation 
the development project has a total estimated investment of approximately million 
we are currently pursuing entitlements to increase this project to a story office tower  which would increase the estimated rentable square feet and total estimated investment 
construction is currently in process and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of n 
mathilda avenue  sunnyvale  california  which we acquired in december for approximately million 
the project  which is comprised of one operating property and a future development site  is pre leased 
our plan at this project is to continue operating the existing building and develop an approximately  square foot office complex for linkedin  the tenant in the current existing building 
the development project has a total estimated investment of approximately million 
construction is currently in progress and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of brannan street  south of market area  san francisco  california  which we acquired in july for approximately million 
we currently expect to develop an approximately  rentable square foot office building on this site that will include all the features  amenities and systems that tech and media tenants need to accommodate their increased densities for a total estimated investment of approximately million 
we currently expect to begin construction in the fourth quarter of columbia square  in hollywood  california  which we acquired in september for approximately million 
this project is a historic media campus located in the heart of hollywood  two blocks from the corner of sunset boulevard and vine street 
the site is fully entitled for the development of an  rentable square foot office  retail and multi family mixed use project under a year development agreement that includes three existing buildings and which we plan to develop in phases 
we intend to redevelop the three existing buildings  which encompass approximately  rentable square feet  and to develop more than  square feet of office  retail and residential space 
we currently expect to invest an additional million for a total estimated investment of approximately million 
our plan is to create a mixed use campus that preserves the historical character while establishing a new center for many entertainment and media companies 
we expect to commence redevelopment of the three historic buildings  and initial construction of the office component in early to mid with completion of phase one targeted for as of the date of this report  we were also in negotiations to acquire an additional future development opportunity 
we cannot provide assurance that we will acquire this project 
in the future  we may also enter into agreements to acquire other development or redevelopment opportunities  either as wholly owned properties or through joint ventures and those agreements typically will be subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions 
in addition  as of december   we had additional undeveloped land holdings  located primarily in various submarkets in san diego county with an aggregate cost basis of approximately million 
this increase in our development and redevelopment activities  primarily as a result of acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of  will cause an increase in the average development asset balances qualifying for interest and other carry cost capitalization in future periods 
incentive compensation 
our executive compensation committee determines compensation  including equity and cash incentive programs  for our executive officers in accordance with the terms and conditions of applicable agreements and incentive award programs 
incentive compensation for our executive officers for was structured to allow the executive compensation committee to evaluate a variety of key factors and metrics at the end of the year and make a determination of incentive compensation for executive officers based on the company and management overall performance 
as a result  accrued incentive compensation and compensation expense for future incentive compensation awards could be affected by our operating and development performance  financial results  total shareholder return  market conditions and other performance conditions 
consequently  we cannot predict the amounts that will be recorded in future periods related to such incentive compensation 
share based compensation

we define net operating income as operating revenues rental income  tenant reimbursements  and other property income less operating expenses property expenses  real estate taxes  provision for bad debts  and ground leases 
net operating income is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income loss because we believe it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of our properties excluding corporate and financing related costs and non cash depreciation and amortization 
net operating income is an unlevered operating performance metric of our properties and allows for a useful comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets 
this measure thereby provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from gaap income loss from operations or net income loss 
in addition  net operating income is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful starting point for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets 
other real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating net operating income  and accordingly  our presentation of net operating income may not be comparable to other real estate companies 
because of the exclusion of the items shown in the reconciliation below  net operating income should only be used as a supplemental measure of our financial performance and not as an alternative to gaap income loss from operations or net income loss 
management further evaluates net operating income by evaluating the performance from the following property groups same store properties which includes the results of all of the office properties that were owned and included in our stabilized portfolio as of january  and still owned and included in the stabilized portfolio as of december   acquisition properties which includes the results  from the dates of acquisition through the periods presented  for the ten office buildings we acquired during and the fourteen office buildings we acquired during  stabilized redevelopment properties which includes the results generated by two office buildings that were moved into the stabilized portfolio upon completion of redevelopment in the fourth quarter of both office buildings were moved into redevelopment during  thus the prior year results reflect operating results for the properties prior to redevelopment 
other properties which includes the results of properties not included in our stabilized portfolio 
these properties consist of one office building in lease up  one redevelopment project under construction and one office building that was moved from the stabilized portfolio during to development since the property is being repositioned

the company business is operated primarily through the operating partnership 
distributions from the operating partnership are the company source of capital 
the company believes the operating partnership sources of working capital  specifically its cash flow from operations and borrowings available under its revolving credit facility  are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the company and  in turn  for the company to make its dividend payments to its preferred and common stockholders for the next months 
cash flows from operating activities generated by the operating partnership for the year ended december  were sufficient to cover the company payment of cash dividends to its stockholders 
however  there can be no assurance that the operating partnership sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs  including its ability to make distributions to the company 
the unavailability of capital could adversely affect the operating partnership ability to make distributions to the company  which would in turn  adversely affect the company ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders 
the company is a well known seasoned issuer  and the company and the operating partnership have an effective shelf registration statement that provides for the public offering and sale from time to time by the company of its preferred stock  common stock  debt securities and guarantees of debt securities and by the operating partnership of its debt securities  in each case in unlimited amounts 
the company evaluates the capital markets on an ongoing basis and  as circumstances warrant  the company and the operating partnership may issue securities of all of these types in one or more offerings at any time and from time to time on an opportunistic basis  depending upon  among other things  market conditions  available pricing and capital needs 
when the company receives proceeds from the sales of its preferred or common stock  it is required by the operating partnership partnership agreement to contribute the net proceeds from those sales to the operating partnership in exchange for corresponding preferred or common units of the operating partnership 
the operating partnership may use these proceeds and proceeds from the sale of its debt securities to repay debt  including borrowings under its revolving credit facility  to develop new or existing properties  to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties  or for general corporate purposes 
as the sole general partner with control of the operating partnership  the company consolidates the operating partnership for financial reporting purposes  and the company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the operating partnership 
therefore  the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the company and the operating partnership are substantially the same on their respective financial statements 
the section entitled liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the company on a consolidated basis and how the company is operated as a whole 
distribution requirements the company is required to distribute of its taxable income subject to certain adjustments and excluding net capital gain on an annual basis to maintain qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes and is required to pay income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent it distributes less than of its taxable income including capital gains 
as a result of these distribution requirements  the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on going operations to the same extent as other companies whose parent companies are not reits 
in addition  the company may be required to use borrowings under the operating partnership revolving credit facility  if necessary  to meet reit distribution requirements and maintain its reit status 
the company may also need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership working capital needs  as well as potential developments of new or existing properties or acquisitions 
the company intends to continue to make  but has not committed to make  regular quarterly cash distributions to common stockholders and common unitholders from cash flow from operating activities 
all such distributions are at the discretion of the board of directors 
the company has historically distributed amounts in excess of our taxable income resulting in a return of capital to its stockholders and the company currently believes it has the ability to maintain distributions at the levels to meet its reit requirements for the company considers market factors and its performance in addition to reit requirements in determining our distribution levels 
amounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders are invested primarily in interest bearing accounts and short term interest bearing securities  which are consistent with the company intention to maintain its qualification as a reit 
such investments may include  for example  obligations of the government national mortgage association  other governmental agency securities  certificates of deposit  and interest bearing bank deposits 
on december   the board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of per common share payable on january  to stockholders of record on december  and caused a per operating partnership common unit cash distribution to be paid in respect of the operating partnership common limited partnership interests  including those owned by the company 
these dividends and distributions are equivalent to an annual rate of per share  which in aggregate totals approximately million of annualized common dividends and distributions per year based on shares of common stock  rsus  and common units outstanding at december  on march  and august   the company issued  shares of its series g cumulative redeemable preferred stock series g preferred stock and  shares of its series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock series h preferred stock  respectively  at a public offering price of per share  for a total of approximately million of net proceeds for each offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering related costs

general our primary liquidity sources and uses are as follows liquidity sources net cash flow from operations  borrowings under the revolving credit facility  proceeds from additional secured or unsecured debt financings  proceeds from public or private issuance of debt or equity securities  and proceeds from the disposition of nonstrategic assets through our capital recycling program 
liquidity uses property or undeveloped land acquisitions  property operating and corporate expenses  capital expenditures  tenant improvement and leasing costs  debt service and principal payments  including debt maturities  distributions to common and preferred security holders  development and redevelopment costs  and outstanding debt repurchases 
general strategy our general strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet with a top credit profile and to maintain a capital structure that allows for financial flexibility and diversification of capital resources 
we manage our capital structure to reflect a long term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our long term capital requirements 
we believe that our current projected liquidity requirements for the next month period  as set forth above under the caption liquidity uses  will be satisfied using a combination of the liquidity sources listed above 
we believe our conservative leverage and staggered debt maturities provide us with financial flexibility and enhances our ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity if necessary  and  therefore  we are well positioned to refinance or repay maturing debt and to pursue our strategy of seeking attractive acquisition opportunities  which we may finance  as necessary  with future public and private issuances of debt and equity securities 
summary of funding transactions we have been active in the capital markets  loan originations and assumptions  and our capital recycling program to finance our acquisition activity and our continued desire to improve our debt maturities and lower our overall weighted average cost of capital

at the market stock offering program under our at the market stock offering program  which commenced in july  we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to million from time to time in at the market offerings 
during the year ended december   we sold  shares of common stock under the program for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds of approximately million  after sales agent compensation 
the proceeds from the sales were used to fund acquisitions and general corporate purposes including repayment of borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
since commencement of the program  we have sold  shares of common stock and  as of december   approximately million remains available to be sold under this program 
actual sales will depend upon a variety of factors including but not limited to market conditions  the trading price of the company common stock and our capital needs 
we have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under this program 
shelf registration statement as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources of the company  the company is a well known seasoned issuer and the company and the operating partnership have an effective shelf registration statement that provides for the public offering and sale from time to time by the company of its preferred stock  common stock  debt securities and guarantees of debt securities and by the operating partnership of its debt securities  in each case in unlimited amounts 
the company evaluates the capital markets on an ongoing basis and  as circumstances warrant  the company and the operating partnership may issue securities of all of these types in one or more offerings at any time and from time to time on an opportunistic basis  depending upon  among other things  market conditions  available pricing and capital needs 
when the company receives proceeds from the sales of its preferred or common stock  it is required by the operating partnership partnership agreement to contribute the net proceeds from those sales to the operating partnership in exchange for corresponding preferred or common units of the operating partnership 
the operating partnership may use these proceeds and proceeds from the sale of its debt securities to repay debt  including borrowings under its revolving credit facility  to develop new or existing properties  to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties  or for general corporate purposes 
unsecured term loan facility in march  we entered into a new term loan facility  which is included in unsecured debt  net on our consolidated balance sheets

potential future capital requirements debt maturities as of december   we had one secured loan with a principal balance of million scheduled to mature in  which we repaid subsequent to year end with a portion of the remaining proceeds from the sale of our industrial portfolio 
potential future acquisitions in  we acquired buildings for approximately million in cash 
in  we acquired buildings for approximately million in cash  all of which we funded through various capital raising activities  and in selected instances  the assumption of existing indebtedness 
in addition  in we acquired six development property project opportunities for approximately million in cash and other assumed liabilities subsequent to december   we acquired a two building office complex in seattle  washington for approximately million with a portion of the remaining proceeds from the sale of our industrial portfolio 
we continually evaluate selected acquisition opportunities as they arise 
as a result  at any point in time  we may have one or more potential acquisitions under consideration that are in varying stages of evaluation  negotiation or due diligence review  which may include potential acquisitions under contract 
we expect that any material acquisitions will be funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility  the public or private issuance of debt or equity securities  or through the disposition of assets under our capital recycling program 
redevelopment and development opportunities as of december   we had one redevelopment and four development projects under construction 
these projects have a total estimated investment of approximately million  of which we have incurred approximately million as of december  of the remaining million yet to be incurred  we are currently contractually obligated to pay approximately million over the next year  which are included in our contractual obligations table above 
we may also incur up to approximately million in additional leasing related costs for these projects over the next year  depending on leasing activity 
in addition  we currently have additional development and redevelopment projects that are scheduled to commence construction in if these projects commence as currently projected  we will invest between million and million in addition to the above commitments 
this estimate is based on market conditions and our anticipation of project approvals 
actual costs could vary depending on changes in circumstances 
ultimate timing of these expenditures may fluctuate given the ultimate progress and leasing status of the projects 
potential future leasing costs and capital improvements given the current economic conditions  the amounts we are required to spend on tenant improvements and leasing costs would need to remain at current levels for us to be able to execute leases at current market terms  as evidenced in the table below 
the amounts we ultimately incur for tenant improvements and leasing costs will depend on actual leasing activity 
tenant improvements and leasing costs generally fluctuate in any given period depending on factors such as the type of property  the term of the lease  the type of the lease  the involvement of external leasing agents  and overall market conditions 
capital expenditures may fluctuate in any given period subject to the nature  extent  and timing of improvements required to maintain our properties 
we believe we could spend between to million in capital improvements  tenant improvements  and leasing costs in for properties within our stabilized portfolio  depending on leasing activity  in addition to approximately million of lease and contractual commitments discussed in our capital commitments table above 
the following tables set forth our historical actual capital expenditures  and tenant improvements and leasing costs for deals commenced  excluding tenant funded tenant improvements  for renewed and re tenanted space within our stabilized portfolio for each of the three years during the period ended december  on a per square foot basis 
year ended december  office properties capital expenditures capital expenditures per square foot tenant improvement and leasing costs replacement tenant square feet tenant improvements per square foot commenced leasing commissions per square foot commenced total per square foot renewal tenant square feet tenant improvements per square foot commenced leasing commissions per square foot commenced total per square foot total per square foot per year average remaining lease term in years includes only tenants with lease terms of months or longer 
excludes leases for month to month and first generation tenants 
capital expenditures per square foot increased moderately in as all of our properties are well maintained and do not require significant capital improvements  we currently anticipate future capital expenditure levels to be consistent with historical levels 
the increase in replacement tenant improvements per square foot commenced is primarily due to increased activity in san diego and san francisco  which command higher lease and tenant improvement rates 
the decrease in renewal tenant improvements per square foot commenced is primarily due to the commencement of one significant lease renewal in excluding this one lease  office tenant improvements per square foot leased would be materially consistent with the previous year 
distribution requirements for a discussion of our dividend and distribution requirements  see liquidity and capital resources of the company distribution requirements 
other potential future liquidity uses as of the filing date  we are in various stages of negotiation on other potential future acquisition opportunities  including potential joint venture opportunities 
we expect that any material acquisitions or development activities will be funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility  the public or private issuance of debt or equity securities  the disposition of assets under our capital recycling program or through the assumption of existing debt 
in addition  the amounts we are required to spend on tenant improvements and leasing costs we ultimately incur will depend on actual leasing activity 
tenant improvements and leasing costs generally fluctuate in any given period depending on factors such as the type of property  the term of the lease  the type of the lease  the involvement of external leasing agents  and overall market conditions 
capital expenditures may fluctuate in any given period subject to the nature  extent  and timing of improvements required to maintain or improve our properties 
factors that may influence future sources of capital and liquidity of the company and operating partnership we continue to evaluate sources of financing for our business activities  including borrowings under the revolving credit facility  issuance of public and private equity securities  unsecured debt and fixed rate secured mortgage financing  and proceeds from the disposition of nonstrategic assets through our capital recycling program 
however  the operating partnership ability to obtain new financing or refinance existing borrowings on favorable terms could be impacted by various factors  including the state of economic conditions  the state of the credit and equity markets  significant tenant defaults  a decline in the demand for office properties  a decrease in market rental rates or market values of real estate assets in our submarkets  and the amount of future borrowings 
these events could result in the following decreases in our cash flows from operations  which could create further dependence on our revolving credit facility  an increase in the proportion of variable rate debt  which could increase our sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations in the future  and a decrease in the value of our properties  which could have an adverse effect on the operating partnership ability to incur additional debt  refinance existing debt at competitive rates  or comply with its existing debt obligations 
in addition to the factors noted above  the operating partnership credit ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and may be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if  in its judgment  circumstances warrant 
in the event that the operating partnership credit ratings are downgraded  we may incur higher borrowing costs and may experience difficulty in obtaining additional financing or refinancing existing indebtedness 
debt covenants the revolving credit facility  term loan facility  unsecured senior notes  and certain other secured debt arrangements contain covenants and restrictions requiring us to meet certain financial ratios and reporting requirements 
key existing financial covenants and their covenant levels include credit facility and unsecured term loan facility as defined in the credit agreement covenant level actual performance at december  total debt to total asset value less than fixed charge coverage ratio greater than x x unsecured debt ratio greater than x x unencumbered asset pool debt service coverage greater than x x unsecured senior notes due  and as defined in the indentures total debt to total asset value less than interest coverage greater than x x secured debt to total asset value less than unencumbered asset pool value to unsecured debt greater than in march  we amended the revolving credit facility to reduce the fmv cap rate as defined in the revolving credit facility  which is used to calculate the fair value of our assets for certain covenants under the revolving credit facility  from to 
the operating partnership was in compliance with all its debt covenants as of december  our current expectation is that the operating partnership will continue to meet the requirements of its debt covenants in both the short and long term 
however  in the event of an economic slowdown or continued volatility in the credit markets  there is no certainty that the operating partnership will be able to continue to satisfy all the covenant requirements 
historical cash flow summary our historical cash flow activity for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was as follows year ended december  dollar change percentage change in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities our cash flows from operations depends on numerous factors including the occupancy level of our portfolio  the rental rates achieved on our leases  the collectability of rent and recoveries from our tenants  the level of operating expenses  the impact of property acquisitions and related financing activities  and other general and administrative costs 
our net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as the result of an increase in cash net operating income generated primarily from our acquisitions portfolio partially offset by increased interest expense attributable to the increase in our average outstanding debt balances as a result of our acquisition activity 
see additional information under the capital rental operations 
investing activities our net cash used in investing activities is generally used to fund property acquisitions  recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures for our operating properties  and development and redevelopment projects 
our net cash used in investing activities increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this net increase was primarily attributable to year over year increases of approximately million due to acquisitions  million due to the increased activity in our redevelopment and development pipeline  million of operating portfolio expenditures due to increased leasing activity  offset by an increase of million of net proceeds received from dispositions 
financing activities our net cash provided by financing activities is generally impacted by our capital raising activities net of dividends and distributions paid to common and preferred security holders 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we were active in the capital markets in  with a net increase of approximately million provided by our various capital raising activities 
this net increase was partially offset by our year over year increase in dividend payments to common stockholders of approximately million as a result of our increased common share count from common equity offerings

non gaap supplemental financial measure funds from operations we calculate ffo in accordance with the white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of nareit 
the white paper defines ffo as net income or loss calculated in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items  as defined by gaap  gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate and impairment write downs associated with depreciable real estate  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance 
the exclusion from ffo of gains and losses from the sale of operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of our activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
also  because ffo is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of reits  it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other reits 
however  other reits may use different methodologies to calculate ffo  and accordingly  our ffo may not be comparable to all other reits 
implicit in historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap is the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  we believe that ffo along with the required gaap presentations provides a more complete measurement of our performance relative to our competitors and a more appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating  financing  and investing activities than the required gaap presentations alone would provide 
however  ffo should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance because it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  which are significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations 
the following table presents our ffo for the years ended december      and year ended december  in thousands net income available to common stockholders adjustments net income attributable to noncontrolling common units of the operating partnership depreciation and amortization of real estate assets net gain on dispositions of discontinued operations funds from operations reported amounts are attributable to common stockholders and common unitholders 
the following table presents our weighted average shares of common stock and common units outstanding for the years ended december      and year ended december  weighted average shares of common stock outstanding weighted average common units outstanding effect of participating securities nonvested shares and restricted stock units total basic weighted average shares units outstanding effect of dilutive securities exchangeable notes  stock options and contingently issuable shares total diluted weighted average shares units outstanding inflation the majority of the company leases require tenants to pay for recoveries and escalation charges based upon the tenant proportionate share of  and or increases in  real estate taxes and certain operating costs  which reduce the company exposure to increases in operating costs resulting from inflation 
new accounting pronouncements there are currently no recently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk we face is interest rate risk 
we mitigate this risk by following established risk management policies and procedures 
these policies include maintaining prudent amounts of debt  including a greater amount of fixed rate debt as compared to variable rate debt in our portfolio  and may include the periodic use of derivative instruments 
as of december  and  we did not have any interest rate sensitive derivative assets or liabilities 
information about our changes in interest rate risk exposures from december  to december  is incorporated herein by reference from item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources of the operating partnership 
market risk as of december   approximately of our total outstanding debt of billion was subject to variable interest rates 
the remaining bore interest at fixed rates 
all of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading purposes 
in general  interest rate fluctuations applied to our variable rate debt will impact our future earnings and cash flows 
conversely  interest rate fluctuations applied to our fixed rate debt will generally not impact our future earnings and cash flows  unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated and need to be refinanced 
however  interest rate fluctuations will impact the fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments 
we generally determine the fair value of our secured debt  revolving credit facility  and term loan facility by performing discounted cash flow analyses using an appropriate market discount rate 
we calculate the market rate by obtaining period end treasury rates for maturities that correspond to the maturities of our fixed rate debt and then adding an appropriate credit spread based on information obtained from third party financial institutions 
we calculate the market rate of our revolving credit facility and term loan facility by obtaining the period end libor rate and then adding an appropriate credit spread based on information obtained from third party financial institutions 
these credit spreads take into account factors  including but not limited to  our credit profile  the tenure of the debt  amortization period  whether the debt is secured or unsecured  and the loan to value ratio of the debt to the collateral 
these calculations are significantly affected by the assumptions used  including the discount rate  credit spreads  and estimates of future cash flow 
we determine the fair value of the liability component of our exchangeable notes by performing discounted cash flow analyses using an appropriate market interest rate based upon spreads for our publicly traded debt 
we determine the fair value of each of our publicly traded unsecured senior notes based on their quoted trading price at the end of the reporting period 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities as of december  and as of december   the total outstanding balance of our variable rate debt was comprised of borrowings on our revolving credit facility of million and borrowings on our term loan facility of million  which were indexed to libor plus spreads of weighted average interest rate of and weighted average interest rate of  respectively 
as of december   the total outstanding balance of our variable rate debt was comprised of borrowings of million on our revolving credit facility  which was indexed to libor plus a spread of weighted average interest rate of 
assuming no changes in the outstanding balance of our existing variable rate debt as of december   a basis point increase in the libor rate would increase our projected annual interest expense  before the effect of capitalization  by approximately million 
comparatively  if interest rates were basis points higher as of december   our projected annual interest expense  before the effect of capitalization  would have been million higher 
the total carrying value of our fixed rate debt  including our exchangeable notes  was approximately billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
the total estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt was approximately billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
for sensitivity purposes  a basis point increase in the discount rate equates to a decrease in the total fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million  or  as of december  comparatively  a basis point increase in the discount rate equates to a decrease in the total fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million  or  as of december
