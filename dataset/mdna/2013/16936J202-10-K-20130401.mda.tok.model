critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
these consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses  to disclose contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the consolidated financial statements  and to disclose the reported amounts of revenues and expenses incurred during the financial reporting period 
the most significant estimates and assumptions include the valuation of accounts receivable  and the useful lives and impairment of property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  the valuation of deferred tax assets and inventories and the provision for income taxes 
we continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we rely on these evaluations as the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
we believe critical accounting policies as disclosed in this form k reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates 
the following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions and estimates and were used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred upon shipment or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes the sales of automobiles upon delivery and acceptance by the customers and where collectibility is reasonably assured 
service revenue related to financing services is recognized ratably over the financing period 
service fees for graphical advertisements on the company s websites are charged on a fixed fee basis 
the company recognizes the advertising revenue when the service is performed over the service term 
the company charges a monthly fee for listing services and recognizes the revenue when services are performed 
the company offers sales incentives to its customers in the form of i subscription exemptions  ii discounted prices and iii free advertisements 
the company classifies sales incentives as a reduction of net revenues 
revenues  net of discounts and allowances  are recognized ratably over the service periods 
the company recognizes revenue from automobile value added services when such services are performed 
receivables related to financing services we record a receivable related to financing services when cash is loaned to customers to finance their purchases of automobiles 
upon repayments by customers  we record the amounts as reductions of receivables related to financing services 
receivables related to financing services represents the aggregate outstanding balance of loans from customers related to their purchases of automobiles and are considered receivables held for investment 
we charge a fee for providing loan services and such fee is prepaid by customers 
we amortize these fees over the receivable term  which is typically days  using the straight line method 
we record such amortized amounts as financing fee income and the unamortized amount is classified as deferred revenue on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables at the end of each of the reporting periods and make estimates for potential credit losses 
we have not experienced any losses on our accounts receivable historically 
inventories inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventory  assessing slow moving and ongoing products 
our products are comprised of the purchase cost of automobiles which declines in value over time 
we continuously evaluate our inventory to determine the reserve amount for slow moving inventory 
income taxes in the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities 
we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income tax purposes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credits by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we conduct this analysis on a quarterly basis 
as of december   the deferred tax assets amounted to  the company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to its international subsidiaries as they are to be reinvested indefinitely 
these earnings relate to ongoing operations and are approximately million as of december  because of the availability of us foreign tax credits  it is not practicable to determine the us income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested 
the company has no material uncertain tax positions as of december  or unrecognized tax benefit which would affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
the company classifies interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of december   there are no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
the company does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits within the next months 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment we perform our impairment tests for goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  we typically estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors  including industry and economic trends and changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
during the year ended december   due to the planned closing of goodcar s operations related to sales of vip membership cards and other promotion services  which is a reporting unit under our automobile value added services segment  we reevaluated our goodwill and intangible assets related to this reporting unit and determined that the related goodwill and intangible assets were impaired 
we recorded impairment losses of  and   after tax in respect of our goodwill and intangible assets related to this reporting unit for the year ended december  except for this reporting unit  there was no indication that the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets related to other reporting units may not be recoverable based on the result of our evaluation

the company reviewed goodcar s advertising operations and decided to cease such operations to generate advertising revenue

we continue to operate goodcar s website to promote our products and services in other segments  including automobile sales  automobile valued added services and financing services 
due to the closing of goodcar s advertising operations  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of  and impairment charges of  net of deferred taxes of  related to the goodwill and intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of goodcar 
in december  the company negotiated with these former owners of qizhong with regard to the outstanding balance of these loans payable 
as a result of the negotiations  these loans were forgiven by these former owners of qizhong due to the fact that certain key executives left goodcar after the purchase and goodcar s operations had not been performing the way it was expected 
the formers owners were willing to forgive this debt since the actual performance of qizhong after the acquisition was far below the performance forecast provided to the company prior to the acquisition

results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  the following table sets forth certain information relating to our results of operations  and our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue  for the periods indicated year ended december  change in net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses income from operations other income income before income taxes and non controlling interests net income net income attributable to shareholders of china auto logistics inc our net revenue for increased to  from  for and our cost of revenue for increased to  from  for gross profit margin decreased basis points from for to for as compared to  our gross profit  income from operations  net income and net income attributable to shareholders of china auto logistics inc for decreased to  decreased to  decreased to  and decreased to  respectively primarily due to the decline of web based advertising services and automobile value added services  which were partially offset by an increase in our revenue from sales of automobiles and financing services 
net revenue the following table sets forth a summary of our net revenue by categories for years indicated  in dollars and as a percentage of total net revenue year ended december  change in net revenue sales of automobiles financing services web based advertising services automobile value added services auto mall management services sales of automobiles net revenue from sales of automobiles increased to  for from  for during and  the company sold  automobiles and  automobiles  respectively  representing an increase of in volume 
the average unit selling price per automobile for decreased to approximately  from approximately  for according to a forecast report issued by ihs automotive ihs on april   it is expected that the growth rates for the high end automobile market in china will exceed those for the mainstream automobile market 
ihs also forecasts the sales will grow during the period from through based on the current growth forecast  china will soon become the top market for most of the major luxury automotive manufacturers 
the company will continue its focus on the marketing of luxury automobiles 
while we remain one of the leaders in the import automobile market  we continue to reduce our gross profit margin in order to expand our market share and maintain our market leader status 
we have been experiencing increased competition from smaller dealers which are willing to lower their selling prices in order to increase their market share 
in response  we have had to lower our prices to retain our market position 
in addition  we experienced higher demand for lower end models for our top selling brands  toyota  bmw and mercedes benz 
as a result  average selling prices for these top three brands declined  and  respectively for the year ended december  as compared to total sales for these top three brands accounted for approximately and of our total automobile sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales to the company s top five customers  each of which is a car dealer  accounted for and of the company s sales during and  respectively 
the company will continue to maintain close working relationships with its top customers while attempting to reduce the concentration of revenues among these top customers actively looking for new customers to enlarge its customer base 
financing services the company provides financing services to its customers using the company s bank facility lines of credit 
the company earns a service fee from its customers for drawing its facility lines of credit related to its customers purchases of automobiles and payment of import taxes 
customers bear all the interest and fees charged by the banks and prepay those fees upon the execution of their service contracts with the company 
net revenue from financing services for increased to  from  for the company had an aggregate amount of credit lines of approximately million as of december  we continue to take advantage of the available credit lines granted by our banks to expand our financing services operations 
as a result  we were able to continue to grow in the financing service segment 
our revenue growth from financing services is heavily dependent on overall industry growth and the economic conditions of the market in the prc 
we established reputable credit with most major commercial banks and although the enormous decrease or the simultaneous expiration of credit lines or other bank facilities may temporarily reduce our capacity to provide financing services and to affect our purchase power  we had not experienced formidable difficulties in the access of credit lines and any other bank facility in the past 
therefore  we do not foresee any difficulty at this time in obtaining credit lines and loan facilities from our banks 
however as the banks in china continue to reduce their credit risks and improve the quality of their outstanding loans  we continue to experience more requirements for obtaining bank lines and loans such as requiring personal guarantees by our executives and directors  and guarantees by our major customers and suppliers 
we provide financing services to our customers with our lines of credit with major commercial banks in the prc  including agricultural bank of china  china merchants bank  pudong development bank  china zheshang bank  industrial and commercial bank of china  shengjing bank and china minsheng bank 
we continue to strengthen our relationship with these banks and aim to negotiate with more banks for higher lines of credit at more favorable terms 
based on the company s business relationships with some financial institutions  we are able to obtain financing on an as needed basis and we are in negotiations for a number of new credit lines 
as of march   the company had a credit line of million rmb million 
although all of our lines of credit have maturities of less than one year and may not be renewed on the same terms  if at all  we do not expect that the expiration of our lines of credit with any one of our existing banks will have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide financing services 
however  if the automobile market in the prc  and in particular the market for imported automobiles  slows down in the future  our revenue from financing services would be materially and adversely affected by a decreased number of transactions 
web based advertising services in and  all revenue from web based advertising services is generated by subscription fees and advertisements 
the company previously operated its domestic automobile website in cities throughout china and targeted to increase the geographical coverage to cities 
during  we reduced our coverage to one single city in tianjin 
in response to the intensified competition in the online advertising markets in china and our revised plan of focusing our business on imported automobiles and related services  we are currently reviewing our website portals future geographical coverage in china 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we revised our business plan and downsized goodcar s operations 
we reviewed goodcar s advertising operations and decided to cease such advertising operations 
we evaluated the projected revenue and profit and costs involved to operate goodcar s advertising operations and concluded that it would be in the company s best interests to cease its operations in order for us to better focus on our core businesses of automobile sales  automobile value added services  auto mall management and financing services 
we continue to operate goodcar s website to promote our products and services in other segments  including automobile sales  automobile valued added services and financing services 
our web based advertising service revenue decreased to  for from  for we have been experiencing stiff competition in the web based advertising arena which continues to drive the pricing of advertising revenue down 
starting in  we have been shifting our focus of operating our websites from generating advertising revenue to providing automotive information to our website visitors 
we are targeting to create a platform that allows our customers and potential customers to have access to our products including the automobile sales  automobile valued added services and financing services 
through offering extensive automotive information and news  we are able to attract more potential customers to visit our websites 
therefore we are willing to sacrifice our advertising revenue in the near term but create opportunities for higher potential growth of our other service products 
the results have been positive as our other services  especially the sales of automobiles and financing services  continue to grow which we believe will benefit us long term 
automobile value added services our automobile value added services vas revenue decreased  to  in from  in the decrease is primarily due to the decrease of goodcar value added service as we ceased such service in the first half of we expect our vas revenue to fluctuate from time to time depending on our customers needs 
auto mall management services pursuant to a services agreement between the company and tianjin prominent hero international logistics co  ltd  dated march   the company agreed to provide services to manage tianjin ftz international automobile exhibition and sales center auto mall management services for a one year period for an aggregate consideration of  the related services fee is recognized ratably over the service period and included as revenue from auto mall management services

cost of revenue year ended december  change in net revenue cost of revenue gross profit our cost of revenue in consisted primarily of the cost of automobiles purchased and certain direct labor and overhead costs related to our financing services  web based advertising services  automobile value added services and auto mall management services 
our cost of revenue increased  from  in to  in the increase was primarily due to the increase in the sales volume of imported automobiles in the year  which is consistent with our net revenue growth rate 
as our cost of revenue consists primarily of the purchase price of imported automobiles  we have limited influence on such costs 
the prices of imported automobiles are determined solely by suppliers and are dependent upon market conditions 
we will continue to work on obtaining more favorable terms and discounts by strengthening our relationship with suppliers and placing more batch orders 
gross profit decreased from  in to  in  due to the cost of revenue increasing at a higher rate than the increase of net revenues 
we are experiencing more competition from our competitors which drove down the sales prices 
in addition  we sold more lower end automobiles  which generate lower gross profit margins 
operating expenses year ended december  change in operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative impairment loss of goodwill and intangible assets total operating expenses increased  from  in to  in this increase was a result of increase of the impairment loss of goodwill and intangible assets on goodcar from  in to  in  which was partially offset by a decrease of selling and marketing expenses from  in to  in and a decrease of general and administrative expense from  in to  in selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses decreased in the following table sets forth a breakdown of the primary selling and marketing expenses of the company year ended december  change in primary selling and marketing expenses office allowance payroll staff related costs advertising and promotion entertainment rent payroll and staff related costs decreased and  respectively  to  and  respectively  in as we substantially reduced employee headcounts at goodcar as personnel at our headquarters were able to assume those functions

advertising and promotion expenses and entertainment expenses decreased by and  respectively  due to reduced costs of promoting our web based advertising related business 
rental expenses decreased primarily due to reduction of goodcar office locations which was partially offset of gradual rent increases of our office and exhibition facilities

rent decreased as we closed down several of our goodcar local offices 
impairment loss of goodwill and intangible assets during the year ended december   due to the planned closing of goodcar s operations related to sales of vip membership cards and other promotion services  which is a reporting unit under our automobile value added services segment  we reevaluated our goodwill and intangible assets related to this reporting unit and determined that the related goodwill and intangible assets were impaired

income from operations income from operations decreased to  in from  in excluding the impairment charge of goodwill and intangible assets of  in and  in  our income from operations decreased to  in from  in the decrease was primarily due to the continuous decline of our gross profit margin on the sales of automobiles from in to in however as we continue to enjoy a high growth in our sales of automobiles  we believe we will continue to maintain our leadership in the imported luxury automobiles industry which will help us to increase the volume for our other service segments 
therefore we foresee our business strategy will continue to help us grow long term 
other income expenses  net other income expenses primarily consists of interest income related to bank deposits  interest expense related to bank borrowings  loss on disposal of property and equipment  and gain on forgiveness of debt 
we recorded a net other income of  for fiscal year and a net other income of  for fiscal year  primarily due to the gain on forgiveness of debt to the former shareholders of goodcar

as a result of the negotiations  these loans were forgiven by these former owners of qizhong because certain key executives left goodcar after the purchase and goodcar s operations had not been performing the way it was expected 
we incurred higher interest expense as we had more outstanding balances on our short term borrowings in income tax income tax expense for the year ended december  was  a decrease from  for the year ended december   which is primarily in line with the decline of our income from operations

we believe that the level of financial resources is a significant factor for our future development and accordingly  we may determine from time to time to raise capital through private debt or equity financings to strengthen the company s financial position  to expand our facilities and to provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of business opportunities 
no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising such additional capital on terms acceptable to us
