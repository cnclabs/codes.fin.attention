item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and other information in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september  overview we are a leading provider of machine to machine mm networking hardware and solutions that enable the connection  monitoring and control of local or remote physical assets by electronic means 
these networking products and solutions can connect communication hardware to a physical asset  convey information about the asset status and performance to a computer system and then use that information to improve or automate one or more processes 
as wireless communications become more and more prevalent  these products and solutions are increasingly deployed via wireless networks 
our wireless and wired hardware products have been the historical foundation of our business 
in fiscal  we acquired etherios  inc  a platinum partner of salesforce 
com and experienced in end user implementation of the salesforce service cloud 
etherios provides consulting and professional services that uses a new cloud based method for integrating machines into core business processes via the salesforce 
com service cloud 
we renamed our idigi cloud based internet platform to device cloud by etherios device cloud 
device cloud provides a secure environment in which customers can aggregate interaction with large numbers of disparate devices and connect enterprise applications to these devices 
device cloud is a platform as a service paas offering that allows devices to be monitored and controlled remotely and lets customers easily collect  interpret and utilize data from many devices to operate their businesses more efficiently 
we also assist customers by providing application development and hosting services 
among our application offerings is the social machine  which enables users of the force 
com platform an offering of salesforce 
com to monitor and control devices

our service offerings include wireless product design and development services  customer relationship management crm consulting services  application development services  licenses to use the social machine application for use on the force 
com platform and our paas recurring revenue generated from device cloud platform  post contract customer support and fees associated with technical support and training 
we utilize many financial  operational  and other metrics to evaluate our financial condition and financial performance 
below we highlight the fiscal metrics that we feel are most important in these evaluations revenue was million 
our revenue was million in fiscal  and increased by million  or  compared to revenue of approximately million in fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from professional services by etherios which was acquired on october   partially offset by a decrease in revenue associated with our mature hardware products 
gross margin was 
our gross margin decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease primarily resulted from lower sales of our mature hardware products which have higher gross margins than our growth hardware products  lower gross margins for services revenue and increased costs to operate the device cloud 
these impacts were partially offset by a reduction in the amortization of purchased and core technology  as certain intangibles were fully amortized 
net income was million and earnings per diluted share were 
our net income was million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  compared to net income of million in fiscal earnings per diluted share were in fiscal compared to in fiscal although revenue increased by in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year  lower gross margins resulted in relatively flat gross profit in fiscal compared to fiscal operating expenses were also higher in fiscal than in the previous year  primarily due to increased operating expenses associated with the operations of etherios and a patent litigation settlement 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
our ebitda was million  or of revenue in fiscal compared to million  or of revenue in fiscal we believe that the presentation of ebitda as a percentage of revenue  which is a non gaap financial measure  is useful because it 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued provides a reliable and consistent approach to measure our performance from year to year and to assess our performance against that of other companies 
we also believe this information helps compare operating results and corporate performance exclusive of the impact of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
ebitda is also used as an internal metric for executive compensation  as well as incentive compensation for the rest of the employee base 
it is monitored quarterly for these purposes 
below is a table reconciling net income to ebitda in thousands year ended september  net income interest income  net income tax provision depreciation and amortization earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization our balance sheet was impacted by investing and financing decisions 
our current ratio was to at september  compared to to at september  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  including long term marketable securities  decreased million to million at september  from million at september  during fiscal  we spent million  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of etherios  inc in addition  we repurchased million of our common stock in fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we accomplished a number of key initiatives in fiscal and also faced significant challenges relative to our business 
accomplishments after declining sales in fiscal  we grew revenue in fiscal by to million  which included revenue from etherios acquired in october  we generated sequential and year over year revenue growth in each of the last three quarters of fiscal  revenue of our growth products portfolio  which includes service revenue  grew year over year in every quarter of fiscal  culminating in growth in the fourth fiscal quarter 
our service revenue included revenue from etherios from the date of acquisition  collectively  our growth hardware products and services revenue grew during the fiscal year  more than offsetting the expected and ongoing decline in sales of our mature hardware products  we completed the acquisition of etherios  inc in the first quarter of fiscal  a transaction that has enhanced our solutions offerings via their platinum partner relationship with salesforce 
com and the introduction of the social machine  an application that enables businesses to monitor devices on the force 
com platform  we continued to enhance our capabilities to sell end to end solutions 
in addition to etherios sales personnel accustomed to making sales of services and solutions  we hired a new senior vice president of global sales and a new vice president of global marketing 
historically we had one executive overseeing these positions 
the individuals hired into these positions have significant experience working in organizations that sell broader based solutions as opposed to point hardware products 
we purchased million of our common stock pursuant to a share repurchase plan 
challenges revenue from our mature hardware products declined by during fiscal  which was aligned with our expectations 
these products remain highly profitable and are a significant source of cash  but their ongoing decline in sales volume creates headwinds to overall revenue growth 
we expect continued future decreases in mature product revenue of annually 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net income fell from million in fiscal to million in fiscal while revenue increased in fiscal  gross profit was flat and operating expenses were higher than the previous year due to incremental operating expenses associated with etherios which was acquired on october  and a patent litigation settlement

the following summarizes our product revenue by growth hardware and mature hardware product categories product revenue of product revenue in millions growth hardware products mature hardware products total product revenue growth hardware product revenue decreased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal growth hardware product revenue decreased million primarily due to a decrease in revenue from modules  satellite related products and wireless communication adapters  partially offset by an increase in revenue of million related to cellular products 
growth hardware product revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decrease in revenue of million related to cellular  wireless communication adapters and serial servers  partially offset by an increase in revenue of million related to modules and satellite related products 
revenue of our mature hardware products generally has decreased as expected for both the twelve month periods ended september  and as compared to the same periods from the previous year 
our serial servers  rabbit branded modules  chips and usb hardware offerings are mature hardware products 
we expect that revenue of these products will continue to decrease in the future as they are in the mature portion of their product life cycles 
revenue of mature products can fluctuate due to large orders from customers as product lines mature

this was offset partially by the decline of mature hardware products revenue  as expected 
north america revenue in fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal due to a lower than anticipated closure rate on large projects 
revenue in emea increased million  or  in fiscal over fiscal mostly due to an improvement in general economic conditions in the european countries and large customer projects that closed during fiscal emea revenue decreased million  or  in fiscal from fiscal this primarily was due to poor economic conditions in the emea market  a lower than anticipated closure rate on large projects and the weakening of the euro versus the us dollar

revenue in asian countries decreased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal mostly related to lower revenue from mature products 
latin america revenue decreased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a longer than anticipated time to close new customer projects as our distributors have been impacted by certain regulatory changes in argentina and unfavorable economic conditions in mexico and brazil 
latin america revenue decreased slightly by million  or  in fiscal from fiscal revenue by distribution channel the following table presents our revenue by distribution channel revenue of revenue in millions direct oem channel distributors channel total revenue during fiscal  revenue in our direct oem channel increased million  or  compared to revenue in fiscal during fiscal  revenue by our distributors decreased by million  or  compared to revenue in fiscal we believe the decrease in revenue in the distributors channel compared to the direct oem channels was due to the decrease in sales of our mature hardware products which are sold more prevalently through distributors as compared to our growth hardware products as well as a decrease in our revenue in apac and latin america  most of which is through distributors 
revenue in our direct oem channel increased primarily due to an increase in revenue for our service offerings  which are typically sold through direct channels 
during fiscal  revenue by our distributors decreased by million  or  compared to revenue in fiscal revenue in fiscal in our direct oem channel increased by million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in revenue in the distributors channel compared to the direct oem channels was due to lower revenue from mature products  lower than anticipated closure rates on large projects  and foreign currency impacts

service gross profit was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the service gross margin for fiscal was compared to in fiscal  a decrease of percentage points 
the decrease is a result of lower gross margins for our crm consulting services as compared to our wireless product design and development services and other services offerings 
we expect our service gross margin to vary from quarter to quarter for the foreseeable future as our crm consulting services and our wireless product design and development services margins are dependent on the utilization rates of our personnel

other income expense  net compared to other income  net was million in fiscal compared to a minimal amount of income in fiscal we recorded million of foreign currency net transaction gains in fiscal compared to foreign currency net transaction losses of million in fiscal this was partially offset by a decrease in interest income on marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents of million  primarily due to the decrease in our average investment balance from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our average interest rate remained at in both fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued compared to total other income  net was minimal in fiscal and million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
this decrease was mostly due to a reduction of million in foreign currency net transaction losses in fiscal as compared to fiscal also during fiscal we recorded a gain on the sale of an investment of million and recorded an additional million in interest income 
our average investment balance increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but our interest income remained the same as the prior fiscal year since we earned an average interest rate of in both fiscal and fiscal income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate will vary based on a variety of factors  including overall profitability  the geographical mix of income before taxes and related statutory tax rate in each jurisdiction  and discrete events  such as settlements of audits 
during fiscal  we recorded a discrete tax benefit of million  related to the january  enactment of the american taxpayers relief act of extending the research and development tax credit for the last three quarters of fiscal and the release of income tax reserves due to the expiration of the statute of limitations from various us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
these discrete tax benefits reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points for the twelve month period ended september  during fiscal  the income tax provision before discrete tax benefits was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to an increase in certain reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and a reduction in domestic tax benefits 
during fiscal  we recorded a discrete tax benefit of million  related to additional research and development tax credits identified for fiscal years ended september   and  reversal of tax reserves for closure of various jurisdictions tax matters and tax rate reductions in foreign jurisdictions 
these discrete tax benefits reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points for the twelve month period ended september  during fiscal  the income tax provision before discrete tax benefits was higher than the statutory rate primarily due to an increase in certain reserves for unrecognized tax benefits  an adjustment for foreign income taxed at the us rate  partially offset by an adjustment in domestic tax benefits 
during fiscal  we recorded a discrete tax benefit of million 
this benefit primarily resulted from the reversal of tax reserves from various jurisdictions  primarily foreign  related to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
it also resulted from the enactment of the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of extending the research and development tax credit that allowed us to record tax credits earned during the last three quarters of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal this benefit reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points for the twelve month period ended september  inflation management believes that during fiscal years  and  inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our consolidated financial position

our working capital was million  million and million at september   and  respectively 
the decrease of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and working capital during fiscal was attributable primarily to the acquisition of etherios and repurchases of common stock

this net decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income of million and a net decrease in working capital of million 
cash flows decreased from working capital due to a million decrease in income taxes payable primarily pertaining to timing of tax payments  net of refunds  as well as lower income tax accruals  and an increase in accounts receivable and inventory of million and million  respectively 
accrued liabilities increased by million and accounts payable increased by million  partially offsetting the aforementioned items 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal  a net decrease of million 
this net decrease is due to a decrease in net income of million  net decreases in non cash items of million and an increase in net working capital of million 
accrued expenses decreased by million  partially offset by an increase of million related to income taxes 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal we spent million on the acquisition of etherios  net of cash acquired  partially offset by million fewer net purchases of marketable securities in fiscal compared to fiscal and million fewer capital expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our net purchases of marketable securities were million less in fiscal as compared to fiscal we spent million for the final deferred payment related to the spectrum acquisition in fiscal we spend an additional million for purchases of capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal net cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal we used million of cash to repurchase our common stock  offset by an increase in proceeds from additional exercises of stock options of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  a net decrease of million  resulting primarily from fewer exercises of stock options 
we expect positive cash flows from operations and believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  cash generated from operations and our ability to secure debt and or equity financing will be sufficient to fund our business operations  common stock repurchases and capital expenditures for the next twelve months and beyond 
on october  our board of directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
this repurchase authorization expires on october  at september   our total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balance  including long term marketable securities was million 
this balance includes approximately million of cash and cash equivalents held by our controlled foreign subsidiaries of which million represents accumulated undistributed foreign earnings 
although we have no current need or intention to repatriate historical earnings in the form of cash in the united states  if we change our assertion from indefinitely reinvesting undistributed foreign earnings  we would have to accrue applicable taxes 
the amount of any taxes and the application of any tax credits would be determined based on the income tax laws at the time of such repatriation 
under current tax laws  we estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability to be in the range of million to million  which could have a material impact on our current consolidated balance sheet  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september  payments due by fiscal period in thousands total less than year years years thereafter operating leases the operating lease agreements included above primarily relate to office space 
the table above does not include possible payments for uncertain tax positions 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalties  was million as of september  due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended time often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties  we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount or timing of future cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities 
the above table also does not include those obligations for royalties under license agreements as these royalties are calculated based on future sales of licensed products and we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount of cash payments 
foreign currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with certain sales transactions being denominated in euros  british pounds  japanese yen and indian rupees and foreign currency translation risk as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
we manage our net asset or net liability position for us dollar accounts in our foreign locations to reduce our foreign currency risk 
we have not implemented a formal hedging strategy to reduce foreign currency risk 
during  we had approximately million of revenue related to foreign customers including export sales  of which million was denominated in foreign currency  predominantly the euro and british pound 
during and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of revenue to foreign customers including export sales  of which million and million  respectively  were denominated in foreign currency  predominantly the euro and british pound

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the values of purchased assets and assumed liabilities in acquisitions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of wired and wireless hardware products to our distributors and direct oem customers 
we recognize hardware product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and there are no post delivery obligations  other than warranty 
under these criteria  product revenue generally is recognized upon shipment of product to customers 
sales to authorized domestic distributors and direct oems are made with certain rights of return and price adjustment provisions 
estimated reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments are established by us based on an analysis of historical patterns of returns and price adjustments as well as an analysis of authorized returns compared to received returns  current on hand inventory at distributors  and distribution sales for the current period 
estimated reserves for future returns and price adjustments are charged against revenue in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded 
material differences between the historical trends used to determine estimated reserves and actual returns and pricing adjustments could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued estimating reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments for all years presented 
the reserve for future returns and pricing adjustments was million at september  and million at september revenue recognized for service revenue as a percentage of total revenue represented  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
our service revenue is derived primarily from professional and engineering services performed by our etherios crm and wireless design teams 
we also have some service revenue that is derived from our device cloud by etherios  which is a platform as a service paas offering in which customers pay for services consumed in terms of devices being managed and monitored  or as a monthly service fee for access to information 
in addition  we have small amounts of revenue from technical support and training 
we recognize service revenue from our etherios crm professional services  wireless design services  and device cloud based upon performance  including final product delivery and customer acceptance 
in addition  we recognize small amounts of revenue from technical support and training as the services are performed 
such revenue is deferred and recognized over the life of the contract as the service is performed 
marketable securities we regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our marketable securities 
when assessing marketable securities for other than temporary declines in value  we consider several factors 
these factors include how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class  the performance of the issuer stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry  expected market volatility  analyst recommendations  the views of external investment managers  any news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the issuer operates 
if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these securities has occurred and is other than temporary  we would record a charge to other income expense 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects the estimate of losses that may result from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on known circumstances regarding collectability of customer accounts and historical collections experience 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences between the historical trends used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts and actual collection experience could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at both september  and september  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we reduce the carrying value of our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
once the new cost basis is established  the value is not increased with any changes in circumstances that would indicate an increase in value after the remeasurement 
if actual product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for the net realizable value of inventories 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of june  or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment 
at june   our market capitalization was million compared to our carrying value of million 
our market capitalization plus our estimated control premium of resulted in a fair value in excess of our carrying value by a margin of 
as a result  no impairment was indicated and we were not required to complete the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis 
no goodwill impairment charges were recorded 
at september   our market capitalization was million compared to our carrying value of million 
since there were no triggering events through september   and our market capitalization plus our estimated control premium of resulted in a fair value in excess of our carrying value by a margin of  no impairment was indicated 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the control premium used in our annual goodwill assessment at june  and our further evaluation of goodwill at september  was based on a control premium study as of june   resulting in a range of control premium of to 
we concluded that a control premium best represented the amount an investor would pay  over and above market capitalization  in order to obtain a controlling interest given current economic conditions in both fiscal and fiscal we chose as it approximated the midpoint of the range and reflected the overall increase in control premiums over the past several years 
income taxes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the us and outside of the us accordingly  we must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
this determination requires us to make several estimates and assumptions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income  and other complex issues  may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in adjustments to our income tax balances that are material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations and could result in potential cash outflows 
we have unrecognized tax benefits of million classified as a long term liability 
we expect that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease approximately million to million over the next months due to the expiration of statute of limitations 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect our effective tax rate is million 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
warranties in general  we warrant our products to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service 
the warranty periods generally range from one to five years 
we typically have the option to repair or replace products we deem defective due to material or workmanship 
estimated warranty costs are accrued in the period that the related revenue is recognized based upon an estimated average per unit repair or replacement cost applied to the estimated number of units under warranty 
these estimates are based upon historical warranty incidents and are evaluated on an ongoing basis to ensure the adequacy of the warranty accrual 
the product warranty accrual was million and million at september  and september   respectively
