for the last several years  we have focused on introducing our advanced asset protection solutions to our customers using proprietary  technology enabled software and testing instruments  including those developed by our products and systems segment 
during this period  the demand for outsourced asset protection solutions  in general  has increased  creating demand from which our entire industry has benefited 
we believe continued growth can be realized in all of our target markets 
concurrent with this growth  we have worked to build our infrastructure to profitably absorb additional growth and have made a number of acquisitions in an effort to 
table of contents leverage our fixed costs  grow our base of experienced  certified personnel  expand our product and technical capabilities and increase our geographical reach 
we have increased our capabilities and the size of our customer base through the development of applied technologies and managed support services  organic growth and the integration of acquired companies

accordingly  we may also seek to obtain capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities  or a combination of both 
as of august   there were outstanding borrowings of approximately million and approximately million of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility 
future uses of cash we expect our future uses of cash will primarily be for acquisitions  international expansion  purchases or manufacture of field testing equipment to support growth  additional investments in technology and software products and the replacement of existing assets and equipment used in our operations 
we often make purchases to support new sources of revenues  particularly in our services segment 
in addition  we will need to fund a certain amount of replacement equipment  including our fleet vehicles 
we historically spend approximately to of our total revenues on capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  and expect to fund these expenditures through a combination of cash and lease financing 
our cash capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for fiscal  and were approximately  and of revenues  respectively 
our future acquisitions may also require capital 
we acquired three companies in fiscal and eleven companies in fiscal  with an initial cash outlay of million 
in some cases  additional equipment will be needed to upgrade the capabilities of these acquired companies 
in addition  our future acquisition and capital spending may increase as we pursue growth opportunities 
other investments in infrastructure  training and software may also be required to match our growth  but we plan to continue using a disciplined approach to building our business 
in addition  we will use cash to fund our operating leases  capital leases and long term debt repayments and various other obligations as they arise 
we also expect to use cash to support our working capital requirements for our operations  particularly in the event of further growth and due to the impacts of seasonality on our business 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of our revenue growth  our introduction of new solutions and enhancements to existing solutions and our expansion of sales and marketing and product development activities 
to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents and future cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements  public or private equity financings  or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies or products that will complement our existing operations 
in the event additional funding is required  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or effect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
contractual obligations we generally do not enter into long term minimum purchase commitments 
our principal commitments  in addition to those related to our long term debt discussed below  consist of obligations under facility leases for office space and equipment leases and contingent consideration obligations in connection with our acquisitions 

table of contents the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of may  in thousands total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal beyond long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations contingent consideration obligations total consists primarily of borrowings from our senior credit facility and seller notes payable in connection with our acquisitions and includes the current portion outstanding 
includes estimated cash interest to be paid over the remaining terms of the leases 
off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the accounting policies that we believe require more significant estimates and assumptions include revenue recognition  valuations of accounts receivable  long lived assets  goodwill  and deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience  known or expected trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates  which may cause our future results to be significantly affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies comprise the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered or products have been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured  as summarized below 
services revenue is primarily derived from providing services on a time and material basis 
service arrangements generally consist of inspection professionals working under contract for a fixed period of time or on a specific customer project 
revenue is generally recognized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each customer arrangement  upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured 
at the end of any reporting period  revenue is accrued for services that have been earned which have not yet been billed 
reimbursable costs  including those related to travel and out of pocket expenses  are included in revenue  and equivalent amounts of reimbursable costs are included in cost of services 

table of contents products and systems sales of products and systems are recorded when the sales price is fixed and determinable and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred generally upon shipment and when collectability is reasonably assured 
these arrangements generally contain multiple elements or deliverables  such as hardware  software that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and related services 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting  when the delivered elements have standalone value  uncertaintles regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no refund or return rights for the delivered elements 
we establish the selling prices for each deliverable based on our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence  if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and  in rare instances  using the price established by management having the relevant authority 
third party evidence of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
we determine esp by considering internal factors such as margin objectives  pricing practices and controls  customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle 
consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles 
when determining esp  we apply management judgment to establish margin objectives and pricing strategies and to evaluate market conditions and product life cycles 
changes in the aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements and therefore may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements  but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 
a portion of our revenue is generated from engineering and manufacturing of custom products under long term contracts that may last from several months to several years  depending on the contract 
revenues from long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting revenues are recognized as work is performed 
the percentage of completion at any point in time is based on total costs or total labor dollars incurred to date in relation to the total estimated costs or total labor dollars estimated at completion 
the percentage of completion is then applied to the total contract revenue to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized in the period 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
contract costs include all direct materials  direct labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs  and all costs associated with operation of equipment 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers  project managers and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in our project performance and the recoverability of any claims 
whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues  thus creating a loss  a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period 
accounts receivable accounts receivable arise from services provided or products and systems sold to the company s customers 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for losses on accounts receivable due to a customer s inability to pay 
the allowance is typically estimated based on an analysis of the historical rate of credit losses or write offs  specific concerns and known or expected trends 
such analysis is inherently subjective 
the company s earnings will be impacted in the future to the extent that actual credit loss experience differs from amounts estimated 
changes in the financial condition of the company s customers or adverse developments in negotiations or legal proceedings to obtain payment could result in the actual loss exceeding the estimated allowance 
long lived assets we perform a review of long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if an indication of impairment is present  we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying amount 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
we estimate fair value based on valuation techniques such as a discounted cash flow analysis or a comparison to fair values of similar assets 
as of may  and  we had million and million in net property  plant and equipment  respectively  and million and million in intangible assets  net  respectively 
there were no long lived asset impairment charges recorded during the years ended may   or long lived assets  net  outside of the us totaled million and million as of may  and  respectively 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair values attributed to underlying net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets 
we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level which for the company is represented by i our services segment  ii our products and systems segment  and iii the european component and iv brazilian component of our international segment  using a two step approach  annually as of march  or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  this is an indicator that the goodwill assigned to that reporting unit may be impaired 
in this case  a second step is performed to allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if it had just been acquired in a business combination  and as if the purchase price was equivalent to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the actual carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying value  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss for that excess 
we consider the income and market approaches to estimating the fair value of our reporting units  which requires significant judgment in evaluation of  among other things  economic and industry trends  estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors 
as of may   the carrying amount of our goodwill was approximately million  of which approximately million relates to our international segment 
a significant portion of our international operations are concentrated in our europe and brazil reporting units 
the economic environments in europe and brazil were difficult in as a result of a contraction in the brazilian economy specifically in the oil and gas industry  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recognized goodwill impairment in our brazil reporting unit of approximately million 
significant deterioration in industry or economic trends  disruptions to our business  inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses  or other factors  may cause further impairment charges to goodwill in future periods 
we believe that the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying amounts as of may  
table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
this process requires that we assess temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets resulting from differing treatment between book and tax of certain items  such as depreciation 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of the evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
evidence used includes information about our current financial position and our results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as all currently available information about future years  including our anticipated future performance  the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies 
for the years ended may  and  we recognized deferred income tax benefits of million and million  respectively 
with the exception of certain state and foreign deferred tax assets  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will have sufficient future taxable income to allow us to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
as of may  the company had state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards nols available to offset future income of million and million  respectively 
the deferred tax asset related to these nol s is million 
the company maintains a valuation allowance of million at may  of which million relates to our state and foreign nol s 
our effective income tax rate was approximately  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge in fiscal  our effective income tax rate was approximately  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
income tax expense varies as a function of pre tax income and the level of non deductible expenses  such as certain amounts of meals and entertainment expense  valuation allowances  and other permanent differences 
it is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year  but are not consistent from year to year 
our effective income tax rate may fluctuate significantly over the next few years due to many variables including the amount and future geographic distribution of our pre tax income  changes resulting from our acquisition strategy  and increases or decreases in our permanent differences 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard update asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which expands the disclosure requirements for amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the update requires an entity to present either parenthetically on the face of the financial statement where net income is presented or in the notes to the financial statements  the effect of significant items reclassified in their entirety from accumulated other comprehensive income and identification of the respective line items effecting net income for instances when reclassification is required under gaap 
for items that are not required by gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures as required by gaap 
the update does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements and 
table of contents is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  that is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets by providing an entity with the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test that is currently in place 
an entity would not be required to quantitatively calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment test beginning after september  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu allows an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this authoritative guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
asu does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income  when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income  or the company s option to present components of other comprehensive income either net of related tax effects or before related tax effects  nor does it affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
effective june   the company adopted the provisions of this updated accounting standard related to comprehensive income 
the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents of million at may  these amounts are held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in bank deposits  money market funds and short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have foreign currency exposure related to our operations in foreign locations 
this foreign currency exposure  particularly the euro  british pound sterling  brazilian real  russian ruble  japanese yen  canadian dollar and the indian rupee  arises primarily from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
for example  a portion of our annual sales and operating costs are denominated in british pound sterling and we have exposure related to sales and operating costs increasing or decreasing based on changes in currency exchange rates 
if the us dollar increases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies have a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
an unfavorable change in the average us dollar exchange rates for fiscal would cause a change in consolidated operating income of approximately million and a favorable change would cause a change of approximately million 
we may consider entering into hedging or forward exchange contracts in the future 
fair value of financial instruments we do not have material exposure to market risk with respect to investments  as our investments consist primarily of highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
effects of inflation and changing prices our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices
