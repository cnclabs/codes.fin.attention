net sales 
net sales for fiscal decreased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal the net sales decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in net sales for one of our larger customers in the industrial commercial sector  as a result of its decreased end market demand  as well as an million decrease in net sales to juniper  as a result of its disengagement and lower end market demand for the products we produced for juniper 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in net sales to various significant customers in all sectors 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal the net sales increase resulted from higher net sales in all of our market sectors  except for a decrease in the networking communications sector 
the net sales increase primarily related to the continued ramp of production for a significant industrial commercial sector customer and million of incremental revenue from the strategic arrangement with kontron the kontron arrangement  as well as program ramps from several other existing customers 
these increases in net sales were partially offset by decreased sales in the networking communications sector due to lower end market demand and two customer disengagements as a result of the acquisition of such customers by other companies 
our net sales by market sector for fiscal  and were as follows in millions market sector networking communications industrial commercial healthcare life sciences defense security aerospace networking communications 
net sales for the networking communications sector decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal the change was primarily the result of an million decrease in net sales to juniper  related to its disengagement  partially offset by increased sales to existing customers in this sector as well as program ramps with new customers 
net sales for the networking communications sector decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in the sector was primarily the result of the million impact from the fiscal disengagement of two significant customers noted above and overall unfavorable end market trends reflecting global economic uncertainty 
net sales to juniper in fiscal did not change significantly from fiscal industrial commercial

table of contents the percentages of net sales to customers representing percent or more of net sales and net sales to our ten largest customers for fiscal  and were as follows juniper top customers juniper disengaged from plexus in fiscal and we expect no further shipments to juniper in fiscal gross profit 
for fiscal  gross profit decreased million  or  compared to fiscal primarily due to decreased net sales  increased fixed expenses related to site expansions in penang  malaysia  xiamen  china and oradea  romania and unfavorable changes in customer mix 
the decrease was partially offset by the sale of certain inventory that had previously been written down 
a slightly larger percentage decrease in revenue as compared to the decrease in gross profit for fiscal led to an increase in gross margin to percent for fiscal from percent for fiscal for fiscal  gross profit increased million compared to fiscal primarily due to the net sales increase 
the increase was partially offset by increased fixed expenses related to higher headcount to support the revenue growth  costs related to the addition of a fourth facility in penang  malaysia of approximately million  transition costs due to the kontron arrangement  and an unfavorable change in customer mix 
customer mix negatively impacted gross profit due to a higher portion of sales from new programs  which tend to be inherently less profitable during early production stages than mature programs 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by escalated pricing pressure  particularly in our networking communications sector 
these factors led to the reduction in gross margin to percent for fiscal from percent for fiscal operating income 
for fiscal  operating income decreased million compared to fiscal the operating income decrease reflected the million decrease in gross profit described above as well as a million increase in selling and administrative expenses s a 
the dollar increase in s a was primarily due to approximately million of recoveries of receivables previously at risk in the prior fiscal year  with no such recovery in the current fiscal year  and approximately million of additional amortization expense in fiscal related to the kontron arrangement 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in incentive compensation expense and additional reductions due to focused cost management efforts 
as a result of the factors discussed above  for fiscal compared to fiscal  operating margin decreased from percent to percent 
for fiscal  operating income increased million compared to fiscal the operating income increase reflected the million increase in gross profit described above  partially offset by a million increase in s a 
the dollar increase in s a was primarily due to a million increase in stock based compensation expense  million of amortization expense resulting from an intangible asset related to the kontron arrangement and an increase in other personnel expenses 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of recoveries of receivables previously at risk 
as a result of the factors discussed above  for fiscal compared to fiscal  operating margin remained at percent 
other income expense 
other expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in expense was largely due to million of decreased interest expense related to our term loan 
interest rate swaps associated with the original term loan expired in fiscal this resulted in lower floating interest rates prior to the establishment of a new interest rate swap agreement and lower fixed interest rates subsequent to the establishment of the new interest rate swap agreement 
this decrease was offset by a million increase in foreign exchange losses and a million increase in other expense as the result of an accrual for property related expenses related to the termination of an agreement for additional land in hangzhou  china 
other expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in expense was largely due to million of increased interest expense primarily related to the million of borrowings under the note purchase agreement that the company entered into during the third quarter of fiscal  as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below 

table of contents income taxes 
income taxes and effective annual income tax rates  with and without the annual valuation allowance  for fiscal  and were as follows dollars in millions income tax expense  as reported valuation allowance expense income tax benefit expense  as adjusted effective annual tax rate  as reported impact of valuation allowance effective annual tax rate  as adjusted the company believes that the non gaap presentation of income tax expense and effective annual tax rate excluding the impact of the valuation allowance provides a more accurate representation and allows for a more meaningful comparison of reporting periods 
income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the company effective annual tax rates primarily vary from the us statutory rate of percent as a result of the mix of earnings from us and foreign jurisdictions and tax holidays granted to our subsidiaries in china and malaysia  where we derive a significant portion of our earnings 
the effective tax rate for fiscal is significantly lower than the effective rate for fiscal primarily as a result of the additional valuation allowance recorded in fiscal on deferred tax assets in the us and discrete tax benefits recorded in  which are further discussed below 
during the preparation of the fiscal consolidated financial statements  the company performed an analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  regarding the need for a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets  consistent with the provisions of asc topic  income taxes 
accordingly  as of september   the company established an additional valuation allowance against the us deferred tax assets  impacting the tax provision by million 
the additional million of the million valuation allowance shown above for fiscal relates to operating losses in germany and romania 
the company continues to assess the need to maintain the valuation allowance established on the us deferred tax assets 
at the close of fiscal  using the measurement criteria found in asc topic  the company believes that the positive evidence does not outweigh the negative and the valuation allowance should remain in place 
in fiscal the company recorded an additional valuation allowance of million for the full year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company identified and recorded a discrete tax adjustment placing a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our uk operations  which increased tax expense by million per diluted share 
our analysis found that in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the uk operations experienced an unanticipated material decline in sales resulting in a loss in fiscal  losses are forecasted to continue into fiscal while we expect our uk operations to regain profitability  the current  forecasted and cumulative losses are substantial negative evidence 
the remaining million of the million valuation allowance shown above for fiscal relates to operating losses  primarily in the us  germany and romania 
having examined the evidence  both positive and negative  it was determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be utilized and should have a valuation allowance placed against them 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company identified and recorded several out of period tax errors that reduced tax expense by million per diluted share 
the company believes these out of period tax errors were not material to the fiscal  or previously issued  financial statements 
we currently expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal to be approximately to percent 
the company has been granted tax holidays for its malaysian and xiamen  china subsidiaries 
these tax holidays expire in fiscal and  respectively  and are subject to certain conditions with which the company expects to comply 
the expiration of the tax holiday in china is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate or on the results of operations 
however  we cannot provide any assurances as to the effect and will continue to monitor the projected impact 
in fiscal  and  these subsidiaries generated income  which resulted in tax reductions of approximately million per basic share  million per basic share and million per basic share  respectively 
net income 
net income  with and without the annual valuation allowance and out of period tax adjustments  for fiscal  and was as follows dollars in millions 
table of contents net income  as reported valuation allowance out of period tax adjustments net income  as adjusted the company believes that the non gaap presentation of net income excluding valuation allowances and out of period tax adjustments provides a more meaningful comparison of reporting periods 
net income for fiscal increased by million  or percent  to million from fiscal this increase was primarily as a result of the net million year over year valuation allowance adjustment 
excluding the valuation allowance and fourth quarter tax out of period adjustments  fiscal net income decreased by million  or percent  from fiscal to million 
primarily as a result of the million valuation allowance adjustment  net income for fiscal decreased by million  or percent  to million from fiscal excluding the valuation allowance adjustment  net income was million  a decrease of million  or percent from fiscal as a result of higher fixed expenses and increased interest expense  partially offset by the effect of higher net sales 
diluted earnings per share 
diluted earnings per share  with and without the annual valuation allowance and out of period tax adjustments  for fiscal  and was as follows diluted earnings per share  as reported valuation allowance out of period tax adjustments diluted earnings per share  as adjusted the company believes that the non gaap presentation of diluted earnings per share excluding valuation allowances and out of period tax adjustments provides a more meaningful comparison of reporting periods 
diluted earnings per share increased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily as a result of the impact of the valuation allowances and fourth quarter out of period tax adjustments discussed above 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowances and out of period tax adjustments  diluted earnings per share increased by in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in diluted earnings per share  as adjusted was primarily due to the positive impact of fewer outstanding shares in due to the stock repurchase program 
diluted earnings per share decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily as a result of the valuation allowance adjustment discussed above 
excluding the per share impact of the valuation allowance adjustment  diluted earnings per share increased to for fiscal the increase in diluted earnings per share excluding the valuation allowance adjustment was primarily due to the effect of a decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding as a result of our share repurchases completed late in fiscal  partially offset by lower net income 
return on invested capital roic 
we use a financial model which is aligned with our business strategy  and includes a roic goal of over our weighted average cost of capital wacc and a operating margin target 
our primary focus is our roic goal  which is designed to create shareholder value and generate enough cash to self fund our targeted organic revenue growth rate of 
for fiscal and forward  we have reduced our targeted organic revenue growth rate to to reflect opportunities in the markets we serve 
we review our internal calculation of wacc annually  at the end of fiscal we reduced our estimated wacc from to for fiscal by exercising discipline to generate roic in excess of our wacc  our goal is to create value for our shareholders 
roic was  excluding million net deferred tax asset reduction and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in roic in fiscal from fiscal was due to lower operating income and an increase in average invested capital as a result of capital expenditures for facility expansions 
see the table below for our calculation of roic dollars in millions 
table of contents operating income tax effected average invested capital after tax roic we define roic as tax effected annualized operating income divided by average invested capital over a rolling five quarter period for the fiscal year 
invested capital is defined as equity plus debt  less cash and cash equivalents 
other companies may not define or calculate roic in the same way 
roic is a non gaap financial measure which should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
non gaap financial measures  including roic  are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight into ongoing financial performance 
in particular  we provide roic because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions because we view roic as an important measure in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long term capital requirements 
we also use a derivative measure of roic as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation 
for a reconciliation of roic to our financial statements that were prepared using gaap  see exhibit to this annual report on form k  which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference

operating income for fiscal decreased million from fiscal due primarily to the decrease in net sales 
net sales for fiscal decreased million  or percent  from fiscal  primarily as a result of decreased end market demand in the networking communications sector  which included the loss of two significant networking communications customers  one as a result of a customer disengagement and the other as a result of a drop in end market demand for the mix of products we produced for that customer 
these decreases were partially offset by the ramp of production for a significant industrial commercial sector customer and the addition of a new customer in this sector as well 
net sales to juniper in fiscal did not change significantly from fiscal operating income for fiscal increased million from fiscal due to a favorable customer mix  an increase in engineering design and services profitability of approximately million and million of recoveries of receivables previously at risk 
asia pacific apac 
table of contents net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily experienced in the healthcare life sciences sector as a result of new program wins which more than offset the million decrease in sales to juniper as a result of its disengagement 
operating income increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the increase in net sales and favorable changes in customer mix combined with higher costs incurred in fiscal related to facility expansion and the kontron arrangement 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal this growth reflected incremental revenue from the kontron arrangement of approximately million as well as higher net sales to multiple customers across our market sectors 
these increases were partially offset by decreased net sales from the disengagement of one customer in the networking communications sector and a decline in end market demand for the mix of products we produce for another customer in this sector as well for an industrial commercial sector customer 
operating income decreased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of costs related to the addition of a fourth facility in penang  malaysia of approximately million  increased expenses related to higher headcount to support capacity investments  transition costs for the kontron arrangement and escalated pricing pressure 
europe  middle east and africa emea net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal the increase in net sales was driven primarily by approximately million from the ramp of new customers in each of our market sectors  partially offset by decreased net sales of million due to the disengagement of an industrial commercial customer 
operating loss increased in the current year as compared to the prior year due to an increase in fixed costs associated with the new facility in oradea  romania and the ramping of new customers at the united kingdom facility 
an increase in labor and parts costs in the fourth quarter of also contributed to the increased operating loss 
net sales for fiscal increased million  or percent  from fiscal the increase in net sales was driven primarily by the addition of new customers in each of our market sectors  partially offset by decreased net sales to an industrial commercial customer as a result of reduced end market demand for the mix of products we produce for that customer 
operating results improved in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to increased profitability in romania based on the mix of customers and increased leverage at the facility 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million as of september  compared to million as of september  the increase in the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to cash generated from operations  partially offset by purchases of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program as well as increased capital expenditures for footprint expansions 
as of september   approximately of our cash balance was held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries 
certain foreign countries impose taxes and overall penalties on transfers of cash  however  our intent is to permanently reinvest funds held in these countries 
if this cash were remitted to the us  additional tax obligations may result that would reduce the amount of cash ultimately available to us in the us currently  we believe that cash held in the us  together with cash available under us credit facilities and cash from foreign subsidiaries that could be remitted to the us without tax consequences  will be sufficient to meet our us liquidity needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future

days in accounts receivable for the three months ended september  remained consistent compared to the three months ended september  days in inventory for the three months ended september  decreased by six days compared to the three months ended september   due to a decrease in year end inventory balances resulting primarily from shipments to juniper as a consequence of its disengagement 
days in accounts payable for the three months ended september  decreased by two days compared to the three months ended september   primarily due to the timing of the purchases during the quarter 
days in cash deposits for the three months ended september  increased by six days compared to the three months ended september  primarily due to cash deposits received from juniper as a result of its disengagement

the credit facility includes a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the revolving credit facility potentially may be increased by million the increase option to million generally by mutual agreement of the company  the lenders  the letter of credit issuers and the administrative agent named in the related credit agreement the credit agreement  subject to certain customary conditions 
quarterly principal repayments of the credit facility term loan of million per quarter ended on march  the final million payment is due on may  the financial covenants as defined under the credit facility require that the company maintain  as of each fiscal quarter end  a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio 
as of september   the company was in compliance with all covenants of the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility  at the company option  bear interest at a defined base rate or the libor rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin based upon the company leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement 
rates would increase upon negative changes in specified company financial metrics and would decrease upon reduction in the current total leverage ratio  to no less than libor plus or base rate plus

table of contents the credit facility and note purchase agreement allow for the future payment of cash dividends or the future repurchases of shares provided that no event of default including any failure to comply with a financial covenant exists at the time of  or would be caused by  the dividend payment or the share repurchases 
we have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not currently anticipate paying them in the future 
however  we evaluate from time to time potential uses of excess cash  which in the future may include share repurchases above those already authorized  a special dividend or recurring dividends 
based on current expectations  we believe that our projected cash flows from operations  available cash and cash equivalents  potential borrowings under the credit facility  and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
if our future financing needs increase  we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing 
accordingly  we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources

our more critical accounting policies are noted below 
table of contents stock based compensation the financial accounting standard board fasb requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be measured at fair value and expensed in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over the service period generally the vesting period of the grant 
we used the modified prospective application  under which compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income beginning with the first period that we adopted the fasb regulation and continuing to be expensed thereafter 
we continue to use the black scholes valuation model to value stock options 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
impairment of long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the projected cash flows the property  plant and equipment are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair market value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks 
foreign currency risk we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges 
our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk 
our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for fiscal   and were as follows net sales total costs the company has evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the periods presented above 
based on the company s overall currency exposure  as of september   a percent change in the value of the us dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
interest rate risk we have financial instruments  including cash equivalents  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we consider the use of interest rate swaps based on existing market conditions and have entered into interest rate swaps for our term loans 
for more information  refer to note  derivatives and fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest rate swap agreements are subject to the further risk that the counterparties to these agreements may fail to comply with their obligations thereunder 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk 
to achieve this  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of highly rated securities  money market funds and certificates of deposit  and limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer 
as of september   our only material interest rate risk is associated with our term loan under our credit facility 
through the use of interest rate swaps  as described above  we fixed the basis on which we pay interest  and the borrowings under the note purchase agreement are based on a fixed interest rate  thus eliminating much of our interest rate risk
