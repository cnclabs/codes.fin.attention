item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception  we have been principally engaged in the development of novel  antibody drug conjugates adc for the treatment of cancer using our expertise in cancer biology  monoclonal antibodies  highly potent cytotoxic  or cell killing  agents  and the design of linkers that enable these agents to remain stably attached to the antibodies while in the blood stream and released in their fully active form after delivery to a cancer cell 
an anticancer compound made using our targeted antibody payload  or tap  technology consists of a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to an antigen target found on cancer cells with multiple copies of one of our proprietary cell killing agents attached to the antibody using one of our engineered linkers 
its antibody component enables a tap compound to bind specifically to cancer cells that express its target antigen  the highly potent cytotoxic agent serves to kill the cancer cell  and the engineered linker controls the release and activation of the cytotoxic agent inside the cancer cell 
with some tap compounds  the antibody component also has anticancer activity of its own 
our tap technology is designed to enable the creation of highly effective  well tolerated anticancer product candidates 
all of the tap compounds currently in clinical testing contain either dm or dm as the cytotoxic agent 
both dm and dm  collectively dmx  are our proprietary derivatives of a cytotoxic agent called maytansine 
we also use our expertise in antibodies and cancer biology to develop naked  or non conjugated  antibody anticancer product candidates 
we have used our proprietary tap technology in conjunction with our in house antibody expertise to develop our own anticancer product candidates 
we have also entered into agreements that enable companies to use our tap technology to develop and commercialize product candidates to specified targets 
under the terms of our agreements  we are generally entitled to upfront fees  milestone payments  and royalties on any commercial product sales 
in addition  under certain agreements we are compensated for research and development activities performed at our collaborative partner request at negotiated prices which are generally consistent with what other third parties would charge 
we are compensated to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials and deliver cytotoxic agent at negotiated prices which are generally consistent with what other third parties would charge 
currently  our partners include amgen  bayer healthcare  biotest  lilly  novartis  roche and sanofi 
we expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from payments under our collaborative arrangements 
details for some of our major and recent collaborative agreements can be found in this form k under item business 
to date  we have not generated revenues from commercial sales of internal products and we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
as of june   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million as of june  we anticipate that future cash expenditures will be partially offset by collaboration derived proceeds  including milestone payments  royalties and upfront fees 
accordingly  period to period operational results may fluctuate dramatically based upon the timing of receipt of the proceeds 
we believe that our established collaborative agreements  while subject to specified milestone achievements  will provide funding to assist us in meeting obligations under our collaborative agreements while also assisting in providing funding for the development of internal product candidates and technologies 
however  we can give no assurances that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be realized in the time frames we expect  or at all 
should we or our partners not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to secure alternative financing arrangements  find additional partners and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
however  we cannot provide assurance that any such opportunities 
table of contents presented by additional partners or alternative financing arrangements will be entirely available to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our collaborative agreements  inventory and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into licensing and development agreements with collaborative partners for the development of monoclonal antibody based anticancer therapeutics 
the terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables which may include i licenses  or options to obtain licenses  to our tap technology  ii rights to future technological improvements  iii research activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner  iv delivery of cytotoxic agents and v the manufacture of preclinical or clinical materials for the collaborative partner 
payments to us under these agreements may include upfront fees  option fees  exercise fees  payments for research activities  payments for the manufacture of preclinical or clinical materials  payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
we follow the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  and asc topic  revenue recognition milestone method  in accounting for these agreements 
in order to account for these agreements  we must identify the deliverables included within the agreement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting based on if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the collaborator 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
at june   we had the following two types of agreements with the parties identified below development and commercialization licenses to use our tap technology and or certain other intellectual property to develop compounds to a specified target antigen referred to as development and commercialization licenses  as distinguished from our right to test agreements described elsewhere amgen three exclusive single target licenses  one non exclusive single target license bayer healthcare one exclusive single target license biotest one exclusive single target license novartis one license to two related targets  one target on an exclusive basis and the second target on a non exclusive basis roche  through its genentech unit five exclusive single target licenses sanofi exclusive license to multiple individual targets 
table of contents option research agreement for a defined period of time to secure development and commercialization licenses to use our tap technology to develop anticancer compounds to specified targets on established terms referred to herein as right to test agreements sanofi novartis lilly there are no performance  cancellation  termination or refund provisions in any of the arrangements that contain material financial consequences to us 
development and commercialization licenses the deliverables under a development and commercialization license agreement generally include the exclusive license to our tap technology with respect to a specified antigen target  and may also include deliverables related to rights to future technological improvements  research activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner and the manufacture of preclinical or clinical materials for the collaborative partner 
generally  development and commercialization licenses contain non refundable terms for payments and  depending on the terms of the agreement  provide that we will i at the collaborator request  provide research services at negotiated prices which are generally consistent with what other third parties would charge  ii at the collaborator request  manufacture and provide to it preclinical and clinical materials or deliver cytotoxic agents at negotiated prices which are generally consistent with what other third parties would charge  iii earn payments upon the achievement of certain milestones and iv earn royalty payments  generally until the later of the last applicable patent expiration or to years after product launch 
in the case of kadcyla  however  the minimum royalty term is years and the maximum royalty term is years on a country by country basis 
royalty rates may vary over the royalty term depending on our intellectual property rights 
we may provide technical assistance and share any technology improvements with our collaborators during the term of the collaboration agreements 
we do not directly control when or whether any collaborator will request research or manufacturing services  achieve milestones or become liable for royalty payments 
as a result  we cannot predict when or if we will recognize revenues in connection with any of the foregoing 
in determining the units of accounting  management evaluates whether the license has stand alone value from the undelivered elements to the collaborative partner based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement 
factors considered in this determination include the research capabilities of the partner and the availability of tap technology research expertise in the general marketplace 
if we conclude that the license has stand alone value and therefore will be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting  we then determine the estimated selling prices of the license and all other units of accounting based on market conditions  similar arrangements entered into by third parties  and entity specific factors such as the terms of our previous collaborative agreements  recent preclinical and clinical testing results of therapeutic products that use our tap technology  our pricing practices and pricing objectives  the likelihood that technological improvements will be made  the likelihood that technological improvements made will be used by our collaborators and the nature of the research services to be performed on behalf of our collaborators and market rates for similar services 
upfront payments on development and commercialization licenses are deferred if facts and circumstances dictate that the license does not have stand alone value 
prior to the adoption of accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables on july   we determined that our licenses lacked stand alone value and were combined with other elements of the arrangement and any amounts associated with the license were 
table of contents deferred and amortized over a certain period  which we refer to as our period of substantial involvement 
the determination of the length of the period over which to defer revenue is subject to judgment and estimation and can have an impact on the amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
historically our involvement with the development of a collaborator product candidate has been significant at the early stages of development  and lessens as it progresses into clinical trials 
also  as a drug candidate gets closer to commencing pivotal testing our collaborators have sought an alternative site to manufacture their products  as our facility does not produce pivotal or commercial drug product 
accordingly  we generally estimate this period of substantial involvement to begin at the inception of the collaboration agreement and conclude at the end of non pivotal phase ii testing 
we believe this period of substantial involvement is  depending on the nature of the license  on average six and one half years 
quarterly  we reassess our periods of substantial involvement over which we amortize our upfront license fees and make adjustments as appropriate 
in the event a collaborator elects to discontinue development of a specific product candidate under a development and commercialization license  but retains its right to use our technology to develop an alternative product candidate to the same target or a target substitute  we would cease amortization of any remaining portion of the upfront fee until there is substantial preclinical activity on another product candidate and its remaining period of substantial involvement can be estimated 
in the event that a development and commercialization license were to be terminated  we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront fee that had not previously been recorded as revenue  but was classified as deferred revenue  at the date of such termination 
subsequent to the adoption of asu no 
 we determined that our research licenses lack stand alone value and are considered for aggregation with the other elements of the arrangement and accounted for as one unit of accounting 
upfront payments on development and commercialization licenses may be recognized upon delivery of the license if facts and circumstances dictate that the license has stand alone value from the undelivered elements  which generally include rights to future technological improvements  research services  delivery of cytotoxic agents and the manufacture of preclinical and clinical materials 
we recognize revenue related to research services that represent separate units of accounting as they are performed  as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is probable 
we recognize revenue related to the rights to future technological improvements over the estimated term of the applicable license 
we may also provide cytotoxic agents to our collaborators or produce preclinical and clinical materials for them at negotiated prices which are generally consistent with what other third parties would charge 
we recognize revenue on cytotoxic agents and on preclinical and clinical materials when the materials have passed all quality testing required for collaborator acceptance and title and risk of loss have transferred to the collaborator 
arrangement consideration allocated to the manufacture of preclinical and clinical materials in a multiple deliverable arrangement is below our full cost  and our full cost is not expected to ever be below our contract selling prices for our existing collaborations 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  the difference between our full cost to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators as compared to total amounts received from collaborators for the manufacture of preclinical and clinical materials was   and million  respectively 
the majority of our costs to produce these preclinical and clinical materials are fixed and then allocated to each batch based on the number of batches produced during the period 
therefore  our costs to produce these materials are significantly impacted by the number of batches produced during the period 
the volume of preclinical and clinical materials we produce is directly related to the number of clinical trials we and our collaborators are preparing for or currently have underway  the speed of enrollment in those trials  the dosage schedule of each clinical trial and the time period such trials last 
accordingly  the volume of preclinical and clinical 
table of contents materials produced  and therefore our per batch costs to manufacture these preclinical and clinical materials  may vary significantly from period to period 
we may also produce research material for potential collaborators under material transfer agreements 
additionally  we perform research activities  including developing antibody specific conjugation processes  on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing stages of drug development 
we record amounts received for research materials produced or services performed as a component of research and development support revenue 
we also develop conjugation processes for materials for later stage testing and commercialization for certain collaborators 
we are compensated at negotiated rates and may receive milestone payments for developing these processes which are recorded as a component of research and development support revenue 
our development and commercialization license agreements have milestone payments which for reporting purposes are aggregated into three categories i development milestones  ii regulatory milestones  and iii sales milestones 
development milestones are typically payable when a product candidate initiates or advances into different clinical trial phases 
regulatory milestones are typically payable upon submission for marketing approval with the fda or other countries regulatory authorities or on receipt of actual marketing approvals for the compound or for additional indications 
sales milestones are typically payable when annual sales reach certain levels 
at the inception of each agreement that includes milestone payments  we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone 
this evaluation includes an assessment of whether a the consideration is commensurate with either the entity performance to achieve the milestone  or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity performance to achieve the milestone  b the consideration relates solely to past performance and c the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
we evaluate factors such as the scientific  regulatory  commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone  the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestone and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment 
non refundable development and regulatory milestones that are expected to be achieved as a result of our efforts during the period of substantial involvement are considered substantive and are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the milestone  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
milestones that are not considered substantive because we do not contribute effort to the achievement of such milestones are generally achieved after the period of substantial involvement and are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone  as there are no undelivered elements remaining and no continuing performance obligations  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
under our development and commercialization license agreements  we receive royalty payments based upon its licensees net sales of covered products 
generally  under these agreements we are to receive royalty reports and payments from its licensees approximately one quarter in arrears  that is  generally in the second month of the quarter after the licensee has sold the royalty bearing product or products 
we recognize royalty revenues when it can reliably estimate such amounts and collectability is reasonably assured 
as such  we generally recognizes royalty revenues in the quarter reported to us by our licensees  or one quarter following the quarter in which sales by our licensees occurred 
right to test agreements our right to test agreements provide collaborators the right to a test our tap technology for a defined period of time through a research  or right to test  license  b take options  for a defined 
table of contents period of time  to specified targets and c upon exercise of those options  secure or take licenses to develop and commercialize products for the specified targets on established terms 
under these agreements  fees may be due to us i at the inception of the arrangement referred to as upfront fees or payments  ii upon taking an option with respect to a specific target referred to as option fees or payments earned  if any  when the option is taken  iii upon the exercise of a previously taken option to acquire a development and commercialization license s referred to as exercise fees or payments earned  if any  when the development and commercialization license is taken  or iv some combination of all of these fees 
the accounting for right to test agreements is dependent on the nature of the option granted to the collaborative partner 
options are considered substantive if  at the inception of a right to test agreement  we are at risk as to whether the collaborative partner will choose to exercise the options to secure development and commercialization licenses 
factors that are considered in evaluating whether options are substantive include the overall objective of the arrangement  the benefit the collaborator might obtain from the agreement without exercising the options  the cost to exercise the options relative to the total upfront consideration  and the additional financial commitments or economic penalties imposed on the collaborator as a result of exercising the options 
for right to test agreements where the options to secure development and commercialization licenses to our tap technology are considered substantive  we do not consider the development and commercialization licenses to be a deliverable at the inception of the agreement 
for those right to test agreements entered into prior to the adoption of asu no 
where the options to secure a development and commercialization license are considered substantive  we have deferred the upfront payments received and recognize this revenue over the period during which the collaborator could elect to take options for development and commercialization licenses 
these periods are specific to each collaboration agreement 
if a collaborator takes an option to acquire a development and commercialization license under these agreements  any substantive option fee is deferred and recognized over the life of the option  generally to months 
if a collaborator exercises an option and takes a development and commercialization license to a specific target  we attribute the exercise fee to the development and commercialization license 
upon exercise of an option to acquire a development and commercialization license  we would also attribute any remaining deferred option fee to the development and commercialization license and apply the multiple element revenue recognition criteria to the development and commercialization license and any other deliverables to determine the appropriate revenue recognition  which will be consistent with our accounting policy for upfront payments on single target licenses 
in the event a right to test agreement were to be terminated  we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront fee that had not previously been recorded as revenue  but was classified as deferred revenue  at the date of such termination 
none of our right to test agreements entered into subsequent to the adoption of asu no 
has been determined to contain substantive options 
for right to test agreements where the options to secure development and commercialization licenses to our tap technology are not considered substantive  we consider the development and commercialization license to be a deliverable at the inception of the agreement and apply the multiple element revenue recognition criteria to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
none of our right to test agreements entered into prior to the adoption of asu no 
has been determined to contain non substantive options 
we do not directly control when or if any collaborator will exercise its options for development and commercialization licenses 
as a result  we cannot predict when or if we will recognize revenues in connection with any of the foregoing 

table of contents inventory we review our estimates of the net realizable value of our inventory at each reporting period 
our estimate of the net realizable value of our inventory is subject to judgment and estimation 
the actual net realizable value of our inventory could vary significantly from our estimates 
we consider quantities of raw materials in excess of twelve month projected usage that are not supported by firm  fixed collaborator orders and projections at the time of the assessment to be excess 
during fiscal years  and  we obtained additional quantities of dmx from our supplier which amounted to more material than would be required by our collaborators over the next twelve months and as a result  we recorded   and million  respectively  of charges to research and development expense related to raw material inventory identified as excess 
we also recorded  to write down certain raw material inventory to its net realizable value  which is also included in research and development expense for the year ended june  our collaborators estimates of their clinical material requirements are based upon expectations of their clinical trials  including the timing  size  dosing schedule and the maximum tolerated dose likely to be reached for the compound being evaluated 
our collaborators actual requirements for clinical materials may vary significantly from their projections 
significant differences between our collaborators actual manufacturing orders and their projections could result in our actual twelve month usage of raw materials varying significantly from our estimated usage at an earlier reporting period 
such differences and or reductions in collaborators projections could indicate that we have excess raw material inventory and we would then evaluate the need to record write downs  which would be included as charges to research and development expense 
stock based compensation as of june   we are authorized to grant future awards under one share based compensation plan  which is the immunogen  inc employee  director and consultant equity incentive plan 
the stock based awards are accounted for under asc topic  compensation stock compensation  pursuant to which the estimated grant date fair value of awards is charged to the statement of operations over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
such amounts have been reduced by our estimate of forfeitures for unvested awards 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based exclusively on historical volatility data of our stock 
the expected term of stock options granted is based exclusively on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term is calculated for and applied to one group of stock options as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior amongst our employee population 
the risk free rate of the stock options is based on the us treasury rate in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the stock options 
estimated forfeitures are based on historical data as well as current trends 
stock compensation cost incurred during the years ended june   and was million  million and million  respectively 
future stock based compensation may significantly differ based on changes in the fair value of our common stock and our estimates of expected volatility and the other relevant assumptions 
results of operations revenues our total revenues for the year ended june  were million compared with million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the million increase in revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year is attributable to all revenue categories  as discussed below 
the million decrease in revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year is attributable to lower revenues from research and development support and clinical materials revenue  partially offset by higher revenues from license and milestone fees 

table of contents revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  increased approximately million to million from million in the year ended june  revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million 
included in license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was a million regulatory milestone achieved under our collaboration agreement with roche  a  development milestone achieved under our collaboration agreement with sanofi and million of license revenue earned upon the execution of a development and commercialization license by novartis 
included in license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was a million milestone payment related to the initiation of phase ii clinical testing of sar achieved under our collaboration agreement with sanofi and two million milestone payments related to regulatory milestones achieved under our license agreements with amgen 
also during the year ended june   biogen idec terminated its exclusive license to our tap technology to develop and commercialize therapeutic compounds to the target cripto and as a result  we recognized the remaining  of the million upfront fee received from biogen idec upon execution of the license which had been previously deferred 
also  during fiscal  we made a change in the estimate of our period of substantial involvement as it relates to our exclusive license with bayer healthcare which resulted in an increase to license and milestone fees of million for the fiscal year ending june  compared to amounts that would have been recognized pursuant to our previous estimate 
included in license and milestone fees for the year ended june  were a million milestone payment related to the initiation of phase i clinical testing of sar by sanofi and a million milestone payment related to the ind filing of bay by bayer healthcare 
the amount of license and milestone fees we earn is directly related to the number of our collaborators  the collaborators advancement of the product candidates  and the overall success in the clinical trials of the product candidates 
as such  the amount of license and milestone fees may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
total revenue recognized from license and milestone fees from each of our collaborative partners in the years ended june   and is included in the following table in thousands year ended june  license and milestone fees collaborative partner amgen bayer healthcare biogen idec biotest novartis roche sanofi other total deferred revenue of million at june  represents payments received from our collaborators pursuant to our license agreements  including a million upfront payment received from lilly during fiscal and million remaining of a million upfront payment received from novartis during fiscal  which we have yet to earn pursuant to our revenue recognition policy 
research and development support revenue was million for the year ended june   million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  these amounts primarily represent research funding earned based on actual resources utilized under our agreements with our collaborators as shown in the table below 
also included in research and development support revenue are fees for developing antibody specific conjugation processes on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing 
table of contents stages of drug development 
the amount of research and development support revenue we earn is directly related to the number of our collaborators and potential collaborators  the stage of development of our collaborators product candidates and the resources our collaborators allocate to the development effort 
as such  the amount of development fees may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
total revenue recognized from research and development support from each of our collaborative partners in the years ended june   and is included in the following table in thousands year ended june  research and development support collaborative partner amgen bayer healthcare biotest lilly novartis sanofi other total clinical materials revenue increased by approximately  to million in the year ended june  compared to million in the year ended june  we earned clinical materials revenue of million during the year ended june  during the years ended june   and  we shipped clinical materials in support of a number of our collaborators clinical trials  as well as preclinical materials in support of certain collaborators development efforts and dmx shipments to certain collaborators in support of development and manufacturing efforts 
the increase in clinical materials revenue in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily due to greater dmx shipments to certain collaborators in support of development and manufacturing efforts 
the decrease in clinical materials revenue in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily related to less clinical material shipped in support of one of our collaborator trials due to larger scale material requirements being provided by another vendor  as well as less preclinical materials shipped during the year 
we are compensated at negotiated prices which are generally consistent with what other third parties would charge 
the amount of clinical materials revenue we earn  and the related cost of clinical materials charged to research and development expense  is directly related to the number of clinical trials our collaborators who use us to manufacture clinical materials are preparing or have underway  the speed of enrollment in those trials  the dosage schedule of each clinical trial and the time period  if any  during which patients in the trial receive clinical benefit from the clinical materials  and the demand our collaborators have for clinical grade material for process development and analytical purposes 
as such  the amount of clinical materials revenue and the related cost of clinical materials charged to research and development expense may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
in february  the us fda granted marketing approval to kadcyla  a product resulting from one of our development and commercialization licenses with roche  through its genentech unit 
we receive royalty reports and payments related to sales of kadcyla from roche one quarter in arrears 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy   of royalties on net sales of kadcyla for the period ended march  was recorded in our fourth quarter of fiscal no royalty revenue was recorded in fiscal years and we expect royalty revenue to increase in future periods as the underlying net sales of kadcyla increase 

table of contents research and development expenses our net research and development expenses relate to i research to evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies  linkers and cytotoxic agents  ii preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and the cost of our own clinical trials  iii development related to clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and iv manufacturing operations which also includes raw materials 
our research and development efforts have been primarily focused in the following areas evaluation of potential antigen targets  evaluation of internally developed and or in licensed product candidates and technologies  development and evaluation of additional cytotoxic agents and linkers  activities related to the process  preclinical and clinical development of our internal product candidates  process improvements to our tap technology  process improvements related to the production of dm  dm and strain development of their precursor  ansamitocin p  operation and maintenance of our conjugate manufacturing facility  including production of our own and our collaborators clinical materials  production costs for the supply of antibody for our internal product candidates  including fill finish services  production costs for the supply of dmx for our and our partners preclinical and clinical activities  non pivotal and pivotal development activities with contract manufacturers for the antibody component of our internal product candidates  linkers  and dm  dm and their precursor  ansamitocin p  and activities pursuant to our development and license agreements with various collaborators 
research and development expense for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  research and development expense was million for the year ended june  research and development salaries and related expenses increased by million to million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  and increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the average number of our research personnel increased to for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  we had an average of for the year ended june  included in salaries and related expenses for the year ended june  is million of stock compensation costs compared to million and million of stock compensation costs for fiscal years and  respectively 
the higher stock compensation costs in fiscal years and are driven by higher stock prices and increases in the number of annual options granted due to increases in personnel 
clinical trial costs increased million to million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year and increased  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due primarily to new trials initiated  including a phase ii trial for imgn in small cell lung cancer  increased site management costs driven from expanded sites and higher patient enrollment 
additionally  antibody development and supply expense increased million to million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year and increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to the advancement of our internal programs and timing of supply requirements 

table of contents we are unable to accurately estimate which potential product candidates  if any  will eventually move into our internal preclinical research program 
we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to develop these products as a result of the uncertainties related to discovery research efforts as well as preclinical and clinical testing 
our decision to move a product candidate into the clinical development phase is predicated upon the results of preclinical tests 
we cannot accurately predict which  if any  of the discovery stage product candidates will advance from preclinical testing and move into our internal clinical development program 
the clinical trial and regulatory approval processes for our product candidates that have advanced or that we intend to advance to clinical testing are lengthy  expensive and uncertain in both timing and outcome 
as a result  the pace and timing of the clinical development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and may not ever result in approved products 
completion dates and development costs will vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to predict 
a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  could cause or contribute to the prevention or delay of the successful completion of our clinical trials  or delay or prevent our obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
the costs to take a product through clinical trials are dependent upon  among other factors  the clinical indications  the timing  size and design of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial  and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
product candidates may be found to be ineffective or to cause unacceptable side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals or may prove impractical to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost or with acceptable quality 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals  would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate  with any degree of certainty  the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of our clinical trials  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates that have advanced into clinical testing will generate revenues and cash flows 
we do not track our research and development costs by project 
since we use our research and development resources across multiple research and development projects  we manage our research and development expenses within each of the categories listed in the following table and described in more detail below in thousands year ended june  research and development expense research preclinical and clinical testing process and product development manufacturing operations total research and development expense research research includes expenses associated with activities to evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies  linkers and cytotoxic agents for our products and in support of our collaborators 
such expenses primarily include personnel  fees to in license certain technology  facilities and lab supplies 
research expenses increased  to million in fiscal year from fiscal year and million to million in fiscal year from fiscal year the increase in fiscal years and was principally due to an increase in salaries and related expenses 

table of contents preclinical and clinical testing preclinical and clinical testing includes expenses related to preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  regulatory activities  and the cost of our own clinical trials 
such expenses include personnel  patient enrollment at our clinical testing sites  consultant fees  contract services  and facility expenses 
preclinical and clinical testing expenses increased million to million in fiscal year from fiscal year and million to million in fiscal year from fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily the result of an increase in clinical trial costs due primarily to site expansion and higher patient enrollment for the imgn phase ii study for small cell lung cancer and increased costs incurred for the imgn phase i trial for ovarian cancer which was initiated during the second half of fiscal and began enrolling patients in fiscal  as well as an increase in salaries and related expenses 
the increase in fiscal year was principally due to increases in salaries and related expenses and increases in clinical trial costs 
the increase in clinical trial costs for fiscal was primarily the result of advancing two new wholly owned product candidates  imgn and imgn  into clinical testing during the year 
the increase was partially offset by lower costs incurred related to our imgn and imgn clinical programs due to completion of earlier stage imgn clinical trials and our returning the rights to imgn to its originator 
process and product development process and product development expenses include costs for development of clinical and commercial manufacturing processes for our own and collaborator compounds 
such expenses include the costs of personnel  contract services and facility expenses 
total development expenses increased  to million in fiscal year from fiscal year and expenses decreased  to million in fiscal year from fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily the result of an increase in salaries and related expenses 
the decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in contract service expense due to transferring responsibility for certain outsourced costs to manufacturing operations  partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses 
manufacturing operations manufacturing operations expense includes costs to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials for our own and our collaborators product candidates  quality control and quality assurance activities and costs to support the operation and maintenance of our conjugate manufacturing facility 
such expenses include personnel  raw materials for our and our collaborators preclinical studies and clinical trials  non pivotal and pivotal development costs with contract manufacturing organizations  manufacturing supplies  and facilities expense 
manufacturing operations expense increased million to million in fiscal year from fiscal year and decreased  to million in fiscal year from fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily the result of i an increase in antibody development and supply expense driven by our imgn  imgn  imgn and imgn programs  ii a decrease in costs capitalized into inventory due to a lower number of manufactured batches of conjugated materials on behalf of our collaborators  and iii an increase in salaries and related expenses 
the decrease in fiscal year was primarily the result of i a decrease in cost of clinical materials revenue due to decreased orders of such clinical materials from our partners and lower amounts of dmx written off as excess  ii a decrease in raw materials and disposables used in production due to timing and mix of manufacturing requirements  and iii a decrease in quality related consultant fees due to internal resources being added to perform this work 
partially offsetting these decreases  i costs capitalized into inventory due to a lower number of manufactured batches of conjugated materials on behalf of our collaborators decreased  ii antibody development and supply expense increased  driven primarily by imgn and imgn  and iii contract service expense increased due to increased fill finish costs for imgn and imgn  greater linker development costs and increased release and stability testing of our internal antibodies 
antibody development and supply expense in anticipation of potential future clinical trials  as well as our ongoing trials  was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and 
table of contents million in fiscal year the process of antibody production is lengthy due in part to the lead time to establish a satisfactory production process at a vendor 
accordingly  costs incurred related to antibody production and development have fluctuated from period to period and we expect these cost fluctuations to continue in the future 
we expect that future research and development expenses will increase due to our continuing advancement of our internal product candidates through clinical trials  as well as expected increases in salaries and related expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related expenses  particularly stock compensation costs 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in salaries and related expenses  particularly stock compensation costs  an increase in patent expenses and an increase in professional service fees  including increased accounting  legal and public reporting fees

we anticipate that our current capital resources and expected future collaborator payments under existing collaborations will enable us to meet our operational expenses and capital expenditures through fiscal year however  we cannot provide assurance that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be received 
should we or our partners not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects

table of contents in addition to the above table  we are contractually obligated to make future success based regulatory milestone payments in conjunction with certain collaborative agreements 
these payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and  given the nature of these events  it is unclear when  if ever  we may be required to pay such amounts 
therefore  the timing of any future payment is not reasonably estimable 
as a result  these contingent payments have not been included in the table above or recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  our development and commercialization license with janssen biotech was terminated and  accordingly  we are no longer obligated to make million of potential future success based milestone and third party payments under such agreement 
as of june  the maximum amount that may be payable in the future under our current collaborative agreements is approximately million  million of which is reimbursable by a third party under a separate agreement 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued guidance to address the diversity in practice related to the financial statement presentation of unrecognized tax benefits as either a reduction of a deferred tax asset or a liability when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists 
this guidance is effective prospectively for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item 
our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts and a euro denominated bank account to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
the contracts are denominated in euros and have maturities of less than one year 
our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the value of transactions  anticipated transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency  resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates include a short duration foreign currency forward contract and a euro denominated bank account 
the contract provides that we receive certain foreign currencies and pay us dollars at specified exchange rates at a specified future date 
although we are exposed to credit and market risk in the event of future nonperformance by a counterparty  management has no reason to believe that such an event will occur
