item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  forecasts  guidance  beliefs and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are dependent upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas  production volumes  estimates of proved reserves  capital expenditures  economic and competitive conditions  regulatory changes and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  particularly in item a 
risk factors and forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed may not occur 
overview we are a publicly traded limited liability company focused on the acquisition and development of mature  long lived oil and natural gas properties in the united states 
our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows allowing us to make monthly cash distributions to our unitholders and  over time  increasing our monthly cash distributions through the acquisition of additional mature  long lived oil and natural gas properties 
through our operating subsidiaries  we own properties and oil and natural gas reserves primarily located in nine operating areas the arkoma basin in arkansas and oklahoma  the permian basin in west texas and new mexico  the big horn basin in wyoming and montana  the piceance basin in colorado  south texas  the williston basin in north dakota and montana  the wind river basin in wyoming  the powder river basin in wyoming  and mississippi 
at december   we owned working interests in  gross  net productive wells 
in addition to these productive wells  we own leasehold acreage allowing us to drill new wells 
we own working interests in approximately  gross undeveloped acres surrounding our existing wells 
approximately or mmboe of our estimated proved reserves were attributable to our working interests in undeveloped acreage 
outlook our revenue  cash flow from operations and future growth depend substantially on factors beyond our control  such as access to capital  economic  political and regulatory developments  and competition from other sources of energy 
oil  natural gas and ngls prices historically have been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future 
sustained periods of low prices for oil  natural gas and ngls could materially and adversely affect our financial position  our results of operations  the quantities of oil  natural gas and ngls reserves that we can economically produce  our access to capital and our ability to pay distributions 
we have mitigated the volatility on our cash flows price with derivative contracts through for oil and through for natural gas 
these hedges are placed on a portion of our proved producing and a portion of our total anticipated production during this time frame 
as oil  natural gas and ngls prices fluctuate  we will recognize non cash  unrealized gains and losses in our consolidated statement of operations related to the change in fair value of our commodity derivative contracts 
we face the challenge of oil  natural gas and ngls production declines 
as a given well s initial reservoir pressures are depleted  oil  natural gas and ngls production decreases  thus reducing our total reserves 
we attempt to overcome this natural decline both by drilling on our properties and acquiring additional reserves 
we will maintain our focus on controlling costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions  as well as controlling the corresponding costs necessary to produce such reserves 
during the year ended december   we drilled and completed seven gross net wells on operated properties and participated in the drilling of twenty gross net non operated wells also completed during the year 
our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors  including the ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals and voluntary reductions in capital spending in a low commodity price environment 
any delays in drilling  completion or connection to gathering lines of our new wells will negatively impact the rate of our production  which may have an adverse effect on our revenues and as a result  cash available for distribution 
in accordance with our business plan  we intend to invest the capital necessary to maintain our production at existing levels over the long term provided that it is economical to do so based on the commodity price environment 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to issue equity or debt securities on favorable terms  or at all  and we may be unable to refinance our reserve based credit facility when it expires 
additionally  in the event of significant declines in commodity prices  our borrowing base under our reserve based credit facility may be re determined such that it will not provide for the working capital necessary to fund our capital spending program and could affect our ability to make distributions 
the next scheduled redetermination of our borrowing base is april results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial and operating data for the periods indicated

the operating results of these properties are included with ours from the date of acquisition forward 
excludes amortization of premiums paid and amortization of value on derivative contracts acquired 
the decrease in oil  natural gas and ngls sales during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to the decrease in our average realized prices 
oil revenues decreased by million from million during the year ended december  to million during the same period in primarily as a result of a per bbl decrease in our average realized oil price  excluding hedges 
our lower average realized oil price  excluding hedges  was primarily due to a lower average nymex price  which decreased from per bbl during the year ended december  to during the same period in natural gas revenues also decreased from million during the year ended december  to million during the same period in primarily as a result of a decrease in our average realized natural gas sales price received  excluding hedges and approximately million in lower natural gas sales associated with the appalachian basin properties divested in connection with the unit exchange completed on march  the impact of the decrease in our natural gas price realizations was offset by a  mmcf increase in our natural gas production volumes from our acquisitions 
our lower average realized natural gas price was primarily due to a lower average nymex price  which decreased from per mcf during the year ended december  to per mcf during the same period in overall  our total production increased by on a boe basis for the year ended december  over the comparable period in and was primarily attributable to the impact from all of our acquisitions completed during on a boe basis  crude oil  natural gas and ngls accounted for  and  respectively  of our production during the year ended december  compared to crude oil  natural gas  and ngls of  and  respectively  during the same period in hedging and price risk management activities during the year ended december   we recognized a million realized gain on commodity derivative contracts related to the settlements recognized during the period and a million unrealized gain related to the change in fair value of derivative contracts not meeting the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting 
these realized and unrealized gains resulted from the changes in commodity prices  and the effect of these price changes is discussed in the paragraph below 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in losses on commodity cash flow hedges that previously met the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting 
this amount relates to derivative contracts that we entered into in order to mitigate commodity price exposure on a portion of our expected production and designated as cash flow hedges 
they were later de designated as cash flow hedges and the losses relate to amounts that settled during which have been reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income 
our hedging program is intended to help mitigate the volatility in our operating cash flow 
depending on the type of derivative contract used  hedging generally achieves this by the counterparty paying us when commodity prices are below the hedged price and we pay the counterparty when commodity prices are above the hedged price 
in either case  the impact on our operating cash flow is approximately the same 
however  because our hedges are currently not designated as cash flow hedges  there can be a significant amount of volatility in our earnings when we record the change in the fair value of all of our derivative contracts 
as commodity prices fluctuate  the fair value of those contracts will fluctuate and the impact is reflected as a non cash  unrealized gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
however  these fair value changes that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations only reflect the value of the derivative contracts to be settled in the future and do not take into consideration the value of the underlying commodity 
if the fair value of the derivative contract goes down  it means that the value of the commodity being hedged has gone up  and the net impact to our cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same 
conversely  if the fair value of the derivative contract goes up  it means the value of the commodity being hedged has gone down and again the net impact to our operating cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same for the quantities hedged 
costs and expenses lease operating expenses include third party transportation costs  gathering and compression fees  field personnel  and other customary charges 
lease operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   of which million was related to increased lease operating expenses for oil and natural gas properties acquired during  million was related to increased expenses on existing wells and million was related to higher than anticipated costs for work in progress at year end  resulting in an increase of costs in the current year activity 
additionally  this increase was offset by a decrease of approximately million of lease operating expenses associated with the appalachian basin properties divested in connection with the unit exchange completed on march  production and other taxes include severance  ad valorem and other taxes 
severance taxes are a function of volumes and revenues generated from production 
ad valorem taxes vary by state county and are based on the value of our reserves 
production and other taxes increased by million to million for the year ended december  severance taxes increased by million due primarily to the increase in oil  natural gas and ngls production due to the arkoma basin acquisition and acquisitions completed during ad valorem taxes decreased by million primarily due to the decrease in oil  natural gas and ngls sales in wyoming  where ad valorem taxes are assessed based on total revenues 
as a percentage of wellhead revenues  production  severance  and ad valorem taxes also remained consistent at for the years ended december  and depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  due primarily to the increase in oil and natural gas properties related to the arkoma basin acquisition and other smaller acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter of an impairment of oil and natural gas properties of million was recognized during the year ended december  as a result of a decline in natural gas prices at the measurement dates  september  and december  such impairment was recognized during the third and fourth quarters of the most significant factor affecting the impairment related to the properties that we acquired in the arkoma basin acquisition and rockies acquisition 
the fair values of the properties acquired determined using forward oil and natural gas price curves at the acquisitions dates were higher than the discounted estimated future cash flows computed using the month average prices at the impairment test measurement dates 
we were able to lock in the higher prices at the time of the acquisitions for of the estimated natural gas production through june for the arkoma basin acquisition and of the estimated natural gas production through december for the rockies acquisition by using commodity derivative contracts 
however  the impairment calculations did not consider the positive impact of our commodity derivative positions as generally accepted accounting principles only allow the inclusion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
the third quarter impairment was calculated based on prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil while the fourth quarter impairment was calculated based on prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our administrative employees and executive officers  related benefits  office leases  professional fees and other costs not directly associated with field operations 
these expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  primarily resulting from higher non cash compensation charges related to additional unit grants in of approximately million and higher compensation related expenses of million during the year  offset by lower legal  advisory and integration costs related to the enp merger completed in december other income and expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to a higher interest rate as a result of the senior notes offerings completed in april and october  and higher average outstanding debt under the reserve based credit facility 
in accordance with the guidance contained within asc topic  the measurement of the fair value at acquisition date of the assets acquired in the acquisitions completed during compared to the fair value of consideration transferred  adjusted for purchase price adjustments  resulted in goodwill of million  which was immediately impaired and recorded as a loss  and a gain of million  resulting in a net gain of million for the year ended december  the comparable measurement for the acquisitions completed during resulted in goodwill of million  which was immediately impaired and recorded as a loss  and a gain of million  resulting in a net loss of million for the year ended december  the net gains and losses resulted from the increases and decreases in oil and natural gas prices used to value the reserves between the commitment and close dates and have been recognized in current period earnings and classified in other income and expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations

the operating results of these properties are included with ours from the date of acquisition forward 
excludes amortization of premiums paid and amortization of value on derivative contracts acquired 
the increase in oil  natural gas and ngls sales during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due primarily to the increases in production from our acquisitions 
we experienced an increase in the average realized oil price  excluding hedges  and an decrease in the average realized natural gas sales price received  excluding hedges 
oil revenues increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the same period in as a result of a per bbl increase in our average realized oil price  excluding hedges  and a  mbbls increase in our oil production volumes 
our higher average realized oil price was primarily due to a higher average nymex price  which increased from per bbl during the year ended december  to per bbl during the same period in however  we did not recognize the entire benefit of the increase in the nymex oil price due to significant widening of the basis differential received on our oil primarily as a result of the temporary closure of exxon mobil pipelines in wyoming during the third quarter due to leaks which affected production from enp s elk basin field where we had to settle for a lower price per barrel of oil produced during the closure 
natural gas revenues increased from million during the year ended december  to million during the same period in as a result of a increase in our natural gas production volumes from the wells acquired in the enp purchase 
the impact of the increase in our natural gas production volumes was offset by a per mcf decrease in our average realized natural gas price  excluding hedges  primarily due to a lower average nymex price  which decreased from per mcf during the year ended december  to per mcf during the same period in additionally  our total production increased by on a boe basis 
the increase in production for the year ended december  over the comparable period in was primarily attributable to the impact from the enp purchase completed in december and all of the additional acquisitions completed during on a boe basis  crude oil  natural gas and ngls accounted for  and  respectively  of our production during the year ended december  compared to crude oil  natural gas  and ngls of  and  respectively  during the same period in hedging and price risk management activities during the year ended december   we recognized a million realized gain on commodity derivative contracts related to the settlements recognized during the period and a million unrealized loss related to the change in fair value of derivative contracts not meeting the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting 
these realized and unrealized gains and losses resulted from the changes in commodity prices  and the effect of these price changes is discussed in the paragraph below 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in losses on commodity cash flow hedges that previously met the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting  respectively 
these amounts relate to derivative contracts that we entered into in order to mitigate commodity price exposure on a portion of our expected production and designated as cash flow hedges 
they were later de designated as cash flow hedges and the losses for the years ended december  and relate to amounts that settled in the respective periods which have been reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income 
costs and expenses lease operating expenses include third party transportation costs  gathering and compression fees  field personnel  and other customary charges 
lease operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   of which million was related to the enp purchase and to increased lease operating expenses for oil and natural gas properties acquired during additionally  contributing to this increase were higher lease operating expenses for wells acquired in the parker creek acquisition and the permian basin i acquisition 
production and other taxes include severance  ad valorem and other taxes 
severance taxes are a function of volumes and revenues generated from production 
ad valorem taxes vary by state county and are based on the value of our reserves 
production taxes increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to higher wellhead revenues  which exclude the effects of commodity derivative contracts 
severance taxes increased by million as a result of increased oil  natural gas and ngls production due to the enp purchase 
ad valorem taxes increased by million primarily due to the taxes on oil and natural gas properties acquired in the enp purchase 
as a percentage of wellhead revenues  production  severance  and ad valorem taxes increased from for the year ended december  to during the year ended december  depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  due primarily to approximately million additional depletion recorded on oil and natural gas properties acquired in the enp purchase and oil and natural gas properties acquired during selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our administrative employees and executive officers  related benefits  office leases  professional fees and other costs not directly associated with field operations 
these expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  principally due to approximately million in incremental costs related to enp  a million increase in compensation related expenses due to the hiring of additional personnel and expanding operations in connection with the enp acquisition  a million increase in non cash compensation charges related to the grant of units to employees and the grant of phantom units to officers and a million increase in general office expenses also resulting from our expanding operations 
additionally  during we incurred million in non recurring transaction costs in connection with the enp purchase 
other income and expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to approximately million of interest expense on the term loan as discussed below borrowed in connection with the encore acquisition  million of interest expense incurred for the enp credit agreement as discussed below and higher average outstanding debt under our reserve based credit facility during the year ended december  in accordance with the guidance contained within asc topic  the measurement of the fair value at acquisition date of the assets acquired in the acquisitions completed during compared to the fair value of consideration transferred  adjusted for purchase price adjustments  resulted in goodwill of million  which was immediately impaired and recorded as a loss  and a gain of million for the year ended december   resulting in a net loss of million 
the measurement of the fair value at acquisition date of the assets acquired in the acquisitions as compared to the fair value of consideration transferred  adjusted for purchase price adjustments  resulted in goodwill of million  which was immediately impaired and recorded as a loss for the year ended december  the gain and losses resulted from the increases and decreases in oil and natural gas prices used to value the reserves between the commitment and close dates and has been recognized in current period earnings and classified in other income and expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap
